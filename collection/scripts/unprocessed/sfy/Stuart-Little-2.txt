FADE IN:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAWN

1

A look at how birds live in the city, emphasizing the
scavenging nature of their existence. We see birds eating
off the ground, out of trash cans, even swooping down to
steal a piece of donut out of the hand of a sleepy citizen
just leaving his house.
The last bird we see flies towards the house of the Little
family.

INT. LITTLE HOUSE - DAY

The first hint of morning light enters the Little
household. All is quiet and peaceful. MR. AND MRS.
LITTLE are asleep in bed. THROUGH the window we see bird
eyes spying in on them.

in the lower bunk.

He grumbles and turns over.

ANGLE ON UPPER BUNK
A tiny lump under a blanket as it begins to move. Moments
later a tail emerges from underneath the sheet. It moves
tentatively, as if checking things out. The tail is
followed by a rear-end dressed in bright pajamas with a
print pattern featuring pineapples (or something funnier)
and then the remainder of a four-inch body. It is STUART.
(For those who haven't read the book or seen the movie,
Stuart is a mouse.)
Stuart is sleepy. He staggers around almost blindly. He
almost steps off the edge of his bunk. This wakes him
more completely. He rubs his eyes and stretches and
smiles. Grabbing hold of a miniature fireman's pole built
out of tinker toys, slides down to the lower bunk and
crosses over to George's sleeping head.
STUART
George, wake up.
George is a hard wake-up.
Stuart stands on George's chest and jumps up and down.

It's Saturday.

He's immediately

GEORGE
Soccer? Uh... No I can't today,
I... caught a cold while I was
sleeping.
He sneezes and blows Stuart halfway across the bed.
Stuart scrambles back quickly. He grabs George's glasses
from the nightstand and masterfully engineers them onto
George's face. He taps on the glasses.
STUART
You'll be fine. Come on, we're
gonna be great. We're gonna play
like Brazilians!
Stuart takes off his pajama top and soccer-kicks it across
the room into a hamper.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

4

Mrs. Little is rushing around the kitchen, feeding the
baby and making breakfast for everyone at the same time.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS her TO the kitchen table as she puts
another spoonful of cereal into the baby's mouth. The
baby is sitting in her highchair between her brothers who
are in their uniforms.
MRS. LITTLE
Stuart, don't forget your water
bottle. George...
Mr. Little enters on the run.
MR. LITTLE
(finishing her
sentence)
... don't forget your cleats.
(to Mrs. Little)
You look especially beautiful
today.
MRS. LITTLE
Some people just know how to wear
oatmeal.
They kiss.
MARTHA BABBLES something that is not a word.

Did you hear that? She said
'bluh-bluh,' her first word.
Where's the baby book? I'll write
it down.
MR. LITTLE
I'm... not sure that's actually a
word.
MRS. LITTLE
Your Uncle Crenshaw said that
every Little starts talking by
nine months.
MR. LITTLE
Yes and in Uncle Crenshaw's case
never stops.
STUART
Are you both coming to the game?
MR. LITTLE
Wouldn't miss it.
MRS. LITTLE
(sotto)
Frederick, this soccer game is
making me very...
MR. LITTLE
... proud?

He starts opening a jar.
MRS. LITTLE
(sotto)
Anxious. Especially 'bout...
She points at Stuart who is trying to get jelly out of a
jar. He almost falls in, but then swings himself out
safely onto the table.
STUART
I'm fine.
MR. LITTLE
He's fine.

She pantomimes squishing and recoils.
MR. LITTLE

Honey, he's a Little. We're all
natural athletes.
(handing her the jar)
Could you open this?
She does.
The toast is burning, the TEA is WHISTLING, the BABY is
CRYING, and Mrs. Little is clearly overwhelmed.
Then the baby pours the remainder of the cereal onto her
head and throws the bowl onto the floor. Mrs. Little
quickly lifts her from the highchair and rushes her to the
sink.
MRS. LITTLE
Okay, that's it for you.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

The game is in progress. George is trying, but some of
the kids are bigger, more aggressive and better coordinated. The whole pack blows right by him.
STANDS
Among the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Little watch the game.
Mrs. Little holds Martha.
MRS. LITTLE
Frederick, why are all the kids
running one way while George is
going the other way?
MR. LITTLE
Well, he, uh... he's an
independent spirit. What bothers
me is, every kid has had a chance
to play except Stuart.
MRS. LITTLE
Well, there's plenty of time.
MR. LITTLE
Plenty of time? There's forty
seconds.
MRS. LITTLE
He did an excellent job handing
out the orange slices. And that's
not as easy as it looks.
He gives her a look.

Nobody gets hurt.

FIELD
A KID on George's team gets kicked in the stomach. He
howls in pain. A whistle blows, stopping the action. The
COACH runs out to help.

The ball comes flying out of the pack towards the goal
that George and Stuart's team are attacking. The closest
players to the ball are George and Stuart, who were
lagging behind the play.
COACH
(hysterical)
Get it! George!

Go after it!

George and Stuart from opposite directions run towards the
ball. Stuart is closer, but George is faster and is
getting to the ball first.
COACH
George, shoot!
Wallace appears out on the wing.
WALLACE
Pass me the ball, lame-o!
COACH
George, shoot!
George shuts his eyes and kicks at the exact moment Stuart
reaches the ball. The ball flies off the ground with
Stuart pasted to it, screaming. The ball hits Wallace -hard -- in the middle of his face and ricochets off.
Wallace, knocked loopy, has the imprint of a mouse on his
forehead.
The ball -- still flying. Stuart still on it, screaming.
It sails into the goal. The GUN GOES OFF. The game is

He just looked so small out there.
So... lacking in bigness. Does
he have to go back next week?
MR. LITTLE
Honey, we have to give him room to
grow.
MRS. LITTLE
I give him room. I let him drive
his car to school. No other
mother does that.
MR. LITTLE
Yes, but with George walking right
beside him every step.
MRS. LITTLE
I let him go out without his
galoshes.
MR. LITTLE

STUART
Painting or dancing.
GEORGE
It's hard to get hurt doing those.
STUART
(glumly)
Yeah...
GEORGE
I guess it's my fault. I'm sorry
I kicked you into the goal.
STUART
That's okay. Hey, you won the
game. That's the main thing.
GEORGE
No... the main thing was I hit
Wallace in the face.

They both laugh.

EXT. LITTLE HOUSE - DAY

Mrs. Little is pruning roses in a tiny planter in front of
the house. She hears:
WILL (O.S.)
Hello, Mrs. Little.

of an American flag and Betty Grable on the side.

GEORGE
Yeah, okay.
STUART
But what about the plane?
GEORGE
I want to play with Will for
awhile.
We can tell Stuart is dejected and that this is painful
for him. The older boys exit. Stuart turns to Snowbell
sleeping on the work table.
STUART
Hey, Snowbell?
(louder)
Snowbell!
Snowbell, wakes up, noisily -- snorting and clearing his
throat.
Whu?

SNOWBELL

Want to help me fix the plane?

Stuart climbs back into the cockpit of the PLANE. He
opens up the instruction book. He reaches under the
dashboard. His sweater catches on the on/off switch and
clicks it ON by accident.
Suddenly the MOTOR WHIRS into action. Snowbell, hearing
the noise, screams, jumps up and dashes out.
Before Stuart realizes what is happening, the airplane is
taxiing down the table. George and Will run in and yell
over the NOISE of the ENGINE.
GEORGE
Stuart, what are you doing?
STUART
(panicked, yelling
back)
I'm not doing it. It won't turn
off.
The plane hits the remote, knocking it off the table. It
breaks. The plane flies off the table and into the next
room. George and Will run after it.
As they enter the dining room, the PLANE BUZZES their
heads.

At least he's indoors, nothing bad

At that exact moment, Mrs. Little opens the front door,
carrying a freshly-cut bouquet.

Have you ever seen prettier roses?
The PLANE RIPS through the bouquet and flies outside.

behind some bushes. We hear STUART SCREAM, then we hear
the sound of a CRASH.
When Stuart opens his eyes, he discovers that both he and
the plane have collided with a thick bush and both wings
are dangling precariously at the side.
Stuart crawls out of the wreckage and scampers down to the
ground. We hear the anxious voices of the entire Little
family as they race toward him.

MR. LITTLE
Also she just loves you so much,
Stuart... it's hard for her to
think of you in danger.
STUART
This has been a bad day. Mom
wants me to paint, George is mad
at me and you and Mom are
fighting.
MR. LITTLE
Well... it's not one of our best
days, but it's not that bad. The
thing about being a Little is you
always see the bright side. Every
cloud has a silver lining.
STUART
Every cloud?

Stuart is sitting at a miniature school desk on the top of
a regular school desk. He is dwarfed by a huge book
propped open on a stand before him. We hear everyone in
the class turning the page. Stuart crosses over to his
book, grabs hold of the bottom of the mammoth page, and
walks it from one side of the book to the other.

then sees what appears to be a wounded BIRD fall out of
the sky and land in the passenger seat of his car.
STUART
Oh, my -- !
Startled, her swerves the CAR all over the sidewalk until
SCREECHING to a stop. He stares at the bird, lying in his
car. Although, we don't know it yet, her name is MARGALO.
Stuart stares at her with a mixture of concern and
fascination. She is definitely a unique creature, not
much bigger than Stuart. She is wearing a pilot's leather
helmet, and goggles and looks like what Amelia Earhart
might have looked like if she was a bird. Cautiously he
reaches out to touch her.
STUART
Miss?... Miss?... Are you alive?
She doesn't answer.

Stuart listens for her heartbeat.

diameter. Peering out the far end he can see Falcon

Well... yeah. Now I don't mind,
you understand. I like it. It's
just now with my injured wing, if
I have to go back out on the
street, well... Hey, I'll survive.
STUART
Oh no, you can't go back out on
the street, not while you're hurt.
MARGALO
Well um... is there anyplace
around here I can crash?
Crash?

STUART
You already crashed.

MARGALO
No. I mean is there anyplace
around here I can lie down for a
while? Maybe just a little box?
You know like one of those jewelry
boxes with those soft linings? I
like those.
STUART
I know just the thing. I'll be
right back. Meanwhile, you can
use my cat's bed.
Margalo recoils.

You have a cat?!

saunters over to his water bowl. Suddenly he sees Margalo
in his bed and nearly jumps out of his skin.
Aaaa!!
Sorry.
you.

SNOWBELL
MARGALO
I didn't mean to scare

SNOWBELL
Scare me! That's a laugh.
(laughs)
Hear that? That was a laugh.
Snowbell now goes through a series of threatening poses
and hissing sounds, then starts choking.
SNOWBELL
Hairball. Major hairball.
He clears his throat.
SNOWBELL
And yet we continue to lick
ourselves. Unbelievable.
Stuart returns.
STUART
Hey, Snowbell, meet Margalo.
She's going to be staying with us
for a while.
SNOWBELL
Staying?! Are you out of your
mind? Stuart, you can't just drag
stray birds in here. What do you
think this is, a halfway house?
It's not sanitary. I mean, look
at her, she's filthy -- no
offense. She could have germs.
And how do you know she's not a
vagrant or a thief? Am I being
too vague? Get rid of her!
Mrs. Little's voice can be heard coming from the doorway.
MRS. LITTLE (O.S.)
Hi, we're home. Sorry we're late.

Oh, that's... how we greet each

MARGALO
Interesting.
SNOWBELL

Never mind. You're in for it now.
Mrs. Little hates when animals

She cups Margalo in her hands and lifts her up, making
kissing noises. Snowbell shakes his head.

OPEN ON a jewelry box that has been converted into an
ornate bedroom suite. A tiny ballerina swirls on the
uppermost level of the box and below it there is a holder
for a tiny toothbrush and a bar of soap. The bottom
drawer has been pulled out and turned into a bed, complete
with a lace doily for a bedspread. It is a surprisingly
opulent setting.
STUART (O.S)
What do you think?
REVEAL Margalo gazing at her new "home" as Stuart waits
expectantly for her reaction. Mr. and Mrs. Little watch
from a discreet distance. Margalo turns away.
What?

STUART
What don't you like?

Margalo sniffles and wipes her eyes with her good wing.
MARGALO
I never... I mean nobody ever...
it's so beautiful.
Stuart is very happy.
MARGALO
But where will your mother keep
her jewelry?
Mrs. Little steps forward.
MRS. LITTLE
Oh, don't worry about that. The
only thing I really value is my
engagement ring.

Oh, you're not?

No. I'm staying home to take care

Well, guess again. You are going
to school and I'll take care of
Margalo. And wear your rubbers

sits down. Stuart serves her a tiny hamburger on a bun,
then picks up a handful of peas from a small serving bowl.
He juggles the peas. He then gets them to roll down his
arm into her plate. He smiles proudly. Just then, a pea
lands on his head, squishing. He winces. Margalo bursts

Stuart and Margalo are in the front seat of Stuart's car.
They're sharing popcorn and are apparently at a drive-in
movie, because we can hear DIALOGUE from an old romantic
MOVIE.
STUART
Are you cold?
Uh-uh.

MARGALO
REVEAL that they are watching an old movie on a portable
television.
STUART
I guess when the weather gets too
cold you'll just... fly south?
MARGALO
Well... to tell you the truth
I've... never flown south.
It's... kind of a dream of mine.
Get out of the cold windy city...
catch that jet stream... fruit
trees... millions of new birds to
meet... I hear it's paradise.

Hey -- the way I see it -- you're
as big as you feel.
STUART
Yeah... Boy, I'm really glad you

MARGALO
What -- ?
She pulls out her stickpin, fully repaired.
My pin!

MARGALO
It's fixed!

How -- ?

STUART

Oh, it was no big deal. You know,
on my way home from school, I
drive right past the place where
you crashed down into my car so I
just got down on the ground and I
crawled around for a while and
bingo there it was -- in a crack
on the sidewalk. Then all I had
to do was take it home, work on it
in the basement in my dad's
workshop and one, two, three, good
as new.

MR. LITTLE
Well, I don't think Stuart thinks
of her as a 'friend.'

Margalo stares at it.

She seems to have mixed reactions.

Now Margalo is juggling peas for Stuart. She serves them
to him, then looks up for one pea she hasn't accounted
for. Then, once again, the last pea lands with a squish
on Stuart's head. Margalo and Stuart both laugh.

Beethoven and joining in with a fancy trill delighting the

understand because you never had a
friend. Just people who were
afraid of you.

That's right. Friendship comes

profitable. I'll prove it to you.

Mrs. Little finishes doing the dishes. She turns away
from the sink with wet hands and finds a dish towel. She

She reaches for the ring stand. The ring is not on it.
Confused, she looks at her finger, then back at the stand,

GEORGE
How is it so far?
Wet.

STUART (O.S.)
Looking up from STUART'S POV, we can see glimpses of his
father's eyes looking down at him and occasional views of
the kitchen ceiling growing further and further away. It
is like he is viewing the world from the wrong end of a
telescope.

I got it.
Margalo quickly takes to the air, raising the necklace
with Stuart holding on to it, and bringing him to safety.
He emerges from the drain empty-handed but to the cheers
of his entire family.
Mrs. Little grabs her little boy and presses him to her
cheek. You've never seen so much love.

They can't answer.

raisins and begins to eat. Snowbell is not happy.
SNOWBELL
I see you remembered to take care
of your needs. What about my
needs.
STUART
Would you like some raisins?
SNOWBELL
(contemptuously)
Cats don't eat raisins! We have
too much class. We eat fish byproducts. Also, I... need to go
tinky.
STUART
How about the alley.
SNOWBELL
An alley? I'm a cat! We're
fastidious creatures. We use a
litter box. We don't just yell
'Bombs away' and go wherever we
are! Look, face it, we're never

Look!
Stuart and Snowbell zero in on a cellular phone sticking
up out of a woman's purse sitting beside her chair.
Stuart rushes to it. He climbs up the side of the purse
and tumbles into it, landing alongside a packet of Kleenex
tissues, a set of keys, a box of Altoids, a pile of loose
change, and the phone. He turns it on and dials.
Suddenly we hear George on the other end and CUT BACK AND

Oh, George, I'm glad you answered.

A helium-filled balloon rising up alongside the Pishkin
Building.
A Coke can is suspended beneath it like a makeshift
gondola. Stuart is standing inside it, slowly dribbling
out handfuls of sand to lighten the load. He looks down
at Snowbell who is waving at him as Stuart rises higher
and higher up the side of the building.

Stuart rising even higher up the side of the building.
The balloon is being buffeted by winds.
He is almost at the top. He sees the falcon gargoyles
just above him. And then he is there. With perfect
timing he steps out of the gondola onto the terrace
surrounding the pinnacle of the building. It is strangely
empty and unguarded. Clearly not many people arrive this
way.
Cautiously, Stuart reaches into his knapsack and pulls out
a bow made out of a paper clip and rubber band, and a pin
cushion full of arrows. He begins stalking through the
large space crouched like a policeman with a gun.
STUART
(quietly)
Margalo? Margalo? Are you up
here? Is anybody here?
Stuart sees a large, frightening-looking bird shadow on
the wall. He gasps in fear, then turns to face the
danger. Only it turns out to be Margalo.

Good-bye... 'friend."

MARGALO
Stuart fires a pin from his bow. It travels truly but
Falcon turns sideways and catches it in his mouth. Then
he spits it back at Stuart. The pin catches Stuart's
collar and pins him to the wall, his feet dangling
pathetically off the ground. Falcon keeps coming at him.
STUART
I hope I wasn't out of line with
that 'birdbrain' remark.
Falcon pulls out the pin. Stuart drops to the floor.

birdcage. He throws her inside and slams the door.
MARGALO
You didn't have to kill him!
FALCON
I didn't. The sidewalk's gonna do
it.
STUART FALLING
Stuart, screaming, is tumbling rapidly. He gets an idea.
He pulls off his backpack and empties it. Then clutching
it by the backstraps, he holds it over his head. The wind
catches it creating a parachute effect which, at least,
slows his rate of descent. It fills with air and becomes
a parachute. He begins to float down.
He lands in a moving garbage truck. Luckily it is a soft
landing and he quickly stands up. Unfortunately, as he
stands a load of garbage is dumped on him. A big metal
can hits him on the head. His eyes crisscross as the
world blurs before him and he topples onto a mound of
garbage bags and passes out.

Stuart covered in coffee grinds and not sure where he is.
He hears the sound of a BOAT WHISTLE and grabs his
throbbing head. Quickly he climbs to the top of a mound
of garbage bags and gasps. He is on a garbage barge
pulling away from a Manhattan dock and heading out to sea.
At the far end of the barge, up a high metal wall, he sees
the barge CAPTAIN and his first mate piloting the boat.
He scampers over a ton of rubbish and tries to call up to

Stuart is on the barge. He's using a broken piece of
pencil to write on a dirty scrap of paper. A whiskey
bottle is alongside.
STUART
Dear Mom and Dad, I am writing
this letter and placing it in this
whiskey bottle, so you will know
what's happened to me -- your son,
Stuart Little. In a few minutes I
will be dumped under a ton of
disgusting trash into the East
River.

No, that might upset them. Dear
Mom and Dad. I've run away to
join the circus. I will from now
on be known as Gazombo the
Mouseboy. Say good-bye to George.
Give Martha a kiss for me. All
my love... Gazombo.
He rolls it up and starts to put it in the bottle but
drops the bottle. It breaks.
STUART
Oh, I am so useless. I thought a
Little is always supposed to see
the silver lining... that must
mean I'm not even a real Little.
Behind Stuart something glints. Stuart's ears twitch.
He's sensing something. Slowly, he turns. He sees the
glint.
STUART
A silver lining.
He walks towards the pile of garbage from which the glint
appeared. He begins tossing aside refuse, until he sees
something that amazes him.

terrible shape and there is no way it could ever fly.

He takes a deep breath and begins scouring the barge for
anything he can find.
We watch Stuart consulting the flight manual and
assembling a pile of strange objects, Band-Aids, Styrofoam
cups and packing material, old combs, string, cardboard,
Q-Tips, rubber bands, electrical wire, and lots of AAA
batteries which he pulls out of old television remotes and
broken electronic toys.
Dowzer and Snoop fly over to watch Stuart, intrigued by
his extraordinary industriousness.
He hears:
SNOOP (O.S.)
Hey, Dowzer, come here.
Stuart peeks over a mound of garbage and sees two stupid
pigeons, SNOOP and DOWZER. Snoop is looking at something
we can't see.
SNOOP
Wanna see the stupidest-looking
pigeon you ever saw?
Sure.

DOWZER
Dowzer comes over beside Snoop.

I was just doing what you said.
MR. LITTLE
Except I didn't say we should let
him go sleep at someone's house
without a toiletries bag, without
pajamas, without checking to see
if he was actually there.
MRS. LITTLE
I did check... Just not right

going to find him?
GEORGE
Well, we could...
MR. LITTLE
No! Don't you speak to me. We'll

I said I was sorry.

All right, George, where is he?
Silence.

He called me. He's all right. He

Who?

MR. LITTLE
Honey, do we know Pishkins?

MRS. LITTLE
We know the Mishkins. And the
Lumpkins. And the Pitkins... The
Pishkin Building? Is that what he
meant?
MR. LITTLE
Let's hope so.

Stuart is taxiing for lift-off.
STUART
Now what?
Gasping, he looks back at the manual for guidance. The
birds jump out of the way and stare in astonishment as he
speeds past them. Faster and faster he goes but does not
leave the ground. The end of the barge is rapidly
approaching. Stuart grits his teeth. The birds seem
nervous too.
The plane is just inches away from the end of the runway
and poised to do a perfect nose dive into the sea. Snoop
covers his eyes with his wings, when suddenly, at the last
possible second, the plane rises into the air.
The Captain looks up just in time to see Stuart fly off
the barge.

Falcon scans the roof until he sees Snowbell's tail
sticking out of the paint car. Margalo steps in front of
the can.
Falcon walks over to the CAN which CONTINUES TO TREMBLE.
He kicks it. It rolls to the edge of the roof.
MARGALO
Snowbell, get out!

She closes

At that very instant the PUTT-PUTT of Stuart's PLANE can
be heard. Falcon spins around as the plane shoots around
from the side of the spire aiming right for Falcon's face.
They all seem stunned to see the other. Falcon jumps
back onto the terrace. Margalo cries when she sees him.

Stuart opens the bomb bay doors and rusty bolts rain down

He spreads his wings, SCREECHES, his eyes turn red, and
his talons actually glisten. He fills the entire window
of the plane.
FALCON
You're mine now, you little
rodent.
Stuart gasps and grabs for the servo. Suddenly the plane
does a flip/flop backwards somersault and tumbles rapidly
toward the traffic below. It is an unexpected maneuver
and takes both Falcon and Stuart by surprise.

How did I do that?
Stuart looks behind him and sees Falcon back in the sky,

comes out of the shed. While the shed door is open,
Stuart flies in and a moment later flies out a window on
the opposite side of the shed.

flight manual but it flies out of the plane. The ground
is spinning rapidly toward him. Terrified, he covers his
eyes.
