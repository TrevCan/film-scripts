EXT.

KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL, DAY - 1994

CARL HERRICK, early 50's, gets out of his piece of junk,
rusted through the floorboards, ten-year-old Chevy station
wagon. He approaches the school entrance. The dull,
weathered letters on the building spell out "John F. Kennedy
High School". A marquee on the grass in front of the building
says, "Home of the Hawkeyes", and "Good Luck! Class of "94".
There are a few cars in the parking lot, fewer people hanging
around -- school is out. The rope on the flagpole clangs
against the pole. A lonely, desolate sound.
Herrick, battered briefcase in one hand, empty box in the
other, trudges into the building.
INT. KENNEDY HIGH
Herrick walks down the hallway. At the far end of the
corridor a janitor is sweeping. All of the lockers hang
open and empty. Herrick enters a classroom.
INT. MUSIC ROOM
Herrick stands in the doorway and takes in the classroom.
The piano at one end -- circling high on the wall are pictures
of Stephen Foster, George Gershwin, Art Tatum, Dizzy
Gillespie, Hank Williams, Chuck Berry, Brian Wilson and the
Beach Boys, one each of the four Beatles, Stevie Wonder,
Elton John, The Ramones, Chrissie Hynde, Dylan, Springsteen,
and of course, Bob Seger -- this is Michigan after all.
Cluttering the classroom is the detritus of the years -- a
dusty, stuffed Opus figure, a .45 record player, records,
sheet music, a clear plastic paperweight with a dandelion
suspended inside -- a stained glass clef note hanging in the
window -- a bust of Beethoven, painted psychedelic.
Herrick breaks himself out of his reverie and walks over to
the desk and drops the box and his briefcase. Where to begin.
He pulls open the desk drawers and starts sorting through
them. Some things go into the wastebasket, others into the
briefcase or the box. There is no joy in his work.
So absorbed is he in his grim sorting that he doesn't hear
the entrance of GLEN MEISTER, the boys' gym teacher. Near
60, his head as bald as a baby's butt, a stomach like he was
smuggling a watermelon under his sweatshirt.

MEISTER
Hi, Carl... I ... I heard they
cut the music program. Damn
shame. Damn shame. Won't be
too long before the pennypinching
bastards start barking at my
heels.
HERRICK
You don't have anything to worry
about, Glen. When they cancel
the sports program in an American
high school it'll be a sign of
the apocalypse.
MEISTER
Well, it's nice to see you got
a sense of humor about the whole
thing.
HERRICK
Sense of humor? Look at me,
Glen. I'm fifty-five years
old, with no job ... not much
of anything really. I've never
owned a new car. My savings
couldn't buy a week at a Holiday
Inn. I'm too young to retire
and too old to rock and roll.
I'm going to clean out my desk
and walk out of here -- and in
a few weeks this room will be
the home for Advanced Algebra
and no one will remember I was
ever here.
Meister doesn't know what to say.
MEISTER
You need any help here?
HERRICK
No.

Thanks.

MEISTER
Well ... hell... You'll be ...
missed around here. You know...
There is an uncomfortable silence as Meister looks around
the room.
MEISTER
I'll see you around, won't I,
Carl?

HERRICK
Yeah, you'll see me around.
Meister pauses a moment, then leaves. Herrick finishes with
the desk drawers and goes over to the record player. There
is a stack of .45 records on the table next to it.
Sorting through the records brings a nostalgic smile. One
record even prompts a laugh. He puts it on the turntable,
turns on the record player and lifts the needle into the
scratchy groove.
THE TRASHMEN
Well, everybody's heard about
the bird...
Well, the bird, bird, bird,
bird is a word...
Well, the bird, bird, bird,
bird is a word...
The opening lines of the stupidest rock song ever written or
sort of sung -- "Surfin' Bird" by The Trashmen.
EXT.
KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL, DAY - 1964
Herrick parks his '62 Corvair convertible in the teachers
lot. His name has been newly painted on the curb. He smiles.
Other cars pull in -- teachers and students going into their
respective lots.
Brand new briefcase in hand, Herrick approaches the school
entrance. School buses pull up in front and discharge
students.
Above the entrance the name of the school is being changed.
"James A. Garfield" is now just a shadow on the unfaded brick.
The maintenance man is on a ladder scrubbing away the dirt
with a wire brush. On the grass below, the new letters are
laid out -- "John F. Kennedy". There is no marquee on the
grass yet.
Herrick enters the school with the flood of students.
INT.

KENNEDY HIGH, DAY

Herrick gets a few curious looks from the students as he
walks down the hall. PRINCIPAL WOLTERS exits a classroom,
sees Herrick.
Mr. Herrick!

WOLTERS
Morning!

HERRICK
Good morning, Principal Wolters.
WOLTERS
No need to be so formal, you
can call me Mr. Wolters. Did I
see you pull up in a Corvair?
A Corvair, son? Didn't you
read Ralph Nader's book?
HERRICK
Yes, sadly. After I bought the
car. And unless Mr. Nader wants
to buy me a new one I'll have
to keep it until the wheels
fall off.
WOLTERS
Which might not be too long
from now. Have a good first
day, Mr. Herrick.
Wolters slaps Herrick on the back and walks away.
checks the room numbers and enters one.

Herrick

INT. MUSIC ROOM
The same piano, the same bust of Beethoven -- still white
faux marble. A scale of notes above the blackboard -- the
rest of the room undecorated.
Students drift in. Herrick sets his briefcase on the desk,
transfers some papers from it to an empty drawer. He checks
the other drawers -- empty except for a stray pencil stub or
paper clip.
He takes a music textbook from his briefcase and plops it
down on the desk. He stares at it with the same enthusiasm
the students probably will.
Turning to the blackboard he prints his name. The bell rings
while he is still printing. He takes a breath and turns to
face a classroom of kids.
HERRICK
Good morning. My name is Mr.
Herrick and that is what I prefer
to be called. Mr. Herrick. It
is a title of courtesy. I will
extend that same courtesy to
you.
Now it is the kids' turn to sigh -- it's going to be a long
year.

INT. CAFETERIA, DAY
The teachers all eat at the same table. Herrick approaches
and puts his tray down. A couple of the other teachers nod
or smile in greeting.
Principal Wolters patrols the cafeteria, corralling a group
of teenage girls gossiping and giggling in a corner.
Glen Meister, 30 years younger, sets his tray across from
Herrick. A full head of hair, flat stomach, sportcoat over
his sweatshirt. He runs his fingers through his hair and
slaps his stomach for emphasis as he talks.
MEISTER
Hi, we haven't met yet.
Glen Meister, Phys. Ed.

I'm

HERRICK
That would account for the
whistle. Carl Herrick, Music.
They shake. Meister looks down at the whistle, puzzled, he
isn't very quick on the uptake.
MEISTER
Yeah, right. Welcome to Gar...
Kennedy. Let me give you a
piece of advice, this being
your first day...
HERRICK
I know, never let the students
get the upper hand.
Herrick sees Wolters making the girls kneel on the floor.
MEISTER
Nah, that's a given. A word to
the wise -- keep your hands off
the girls' gym teacher.
HERRICK
Pardon?
MEISTER
Your predecessor, Mr. Bunte,
was caught giving Miss Esparza
a beef injection on the Home Ec
room sofa. They fired her cute
little butt.
HERRICK
And him, too, of course.

MEISTER
No, it wasn't his fault. She
was a flirt. Bunte got a
reprimand, out his wife hit him
with their Buick. He's in
Arizona recuperating and the
wife is in Chicago, auditioning
lawyers I'd guess.
Wolters is measuring each of the girls' skirts. Several of
the skirts don't touch the floor when the girls kneel.
Wolters barks and the skirts are unrolled at the waist until
they hit linoleum. The girls are released, their faces red.
Wolters' dress code radar spots one of the boys.
WOLTERS
Mr. Postma, is that a pair of
dungarees?
Wolters takes the boy by the elbow and escorts him out of
the cafeteria. Herrick shakes his head.
HERRICK
So, keep my hands off the girls'
gym teacher, right?
MEISTER
That's the word, though it's
easier this year. That's her,
there, Miss Jacobs.
MISS JACOBS, a woman in shorts and a Garfield High School Tshirt carries a tray toward their table. Squat, muscular,
the shape of a fire hydrant, she looks like a bulldog with
breasts.
HERRICK
I'll try to control my lust.
Meister laughs and slaps his stomach.
INT. MUSIC ROOM, DAY
Herrick writes on the blackboard -- "Lydian Model".
HERRICK
The Lydian mode is equivalent
to the white keys on the piano,
from F to F. From this we get
the Ambrosian and Gregorian
modes. Who can tell me where
the term Gregorian comes from?

Herrick looks at the class -- they are in a severe trance of
boredom. So is Herrick.
HERRICK
Okay... Pope Gregory the First
was trying to add to the variety
of church composition. Since
the 4th Century there had only
been allowed...
He's not making things any better.
EXT.

HERRICK HOUSE, DAY

Herrick parks the Corvair in the driveway of a small house.
As he gets out of the car and enters the house his briefcase
seems to drag him down. It's been a long day.
INT. HERRICK HOUSE
IRIS HERRICK, 20's and pretty, hair always mussed, kneels
behind a tripod-mounted camera. Low to the floor, the focus
of the camera is a baby on a scrap of carpet.
The living room of the house is a photography studio, lights
set up, a large paper backdrop hanging from one wall -everything crowded among a huge record collection and a small
piano.
The baby wails, tears streaming down it's red face.

I don't understand this at all.
He's usually such a happy baby.
Iris and the mother try to amuse the baby, but to no avail.
Herrick enters, takes a look at the bawling kid
HERRICK
Perfect.
He drops his briefcase. Iris gives him a peck on the cheek.
The mother shakes a rattle at the baby -- the baby grabs it
and throws it in her face.
IRIS
How was your first day?
HERRICK
As expected.

HERRICK (CONT'D)
I don't know what their last
teacher was doing, but he wasn't
teaching music. Well, actually,
I do know what he was doing,
but these kids don't know a
barcarole from a barber shop
quartet.
He goes into the bathroom and walks over to the sink -- there
is a pan of developer in it. There is another on the back
of the toilet. The shower has a string of 8 X 10's drying
and the window has been blacked out. Herrick exits.
Iris and the mother are making faces at the baby.

He screams

IRIS
Carl, I don't know what a
barcarole is. So, it wasn't a

IRIS
At least your kids don't pee on
you. Of course, it's only your
first day.
He washes his face, the splash of cold water is a relief.
HERRICK
Thanks a whole lot.
Eyes closed, he feels around for a towel -- the rack is empty.
Iris and the mother wave toys at the baby -- he tries for
high 'C'.
Herrick, feeling blindly for a towel, a doily, anything -walks toward the living room, trips over his briefcase and
takes a header into the sofa.
The baby stops crying -- and bursts into laughter.
FLASH!

Iris snaps a few pictures.
IRIS
Thanks, hon!

She tosses her husband a clean diaper and he wipes his face.
INT. HERRICK HOUSE, NIGHT
Herrick sits at the piano, composing. His dinner, halfeaten,
lays on a TV tray next to him. Totally absorbed in making
notations on the composing paper, he doesn't hear Iris,
wearing a rubber apron over her clothes, come out of the redlit bathroom. She slips up behind him and kisses his ear.
HERRICK
Oooh, what is that perfume,
madame? Eau de developer fluid?
That always makes my blood race.
IRIS
I made thirty-two dollars today.

Was it really so bad at school?
It's a job.

That's what it is,

Well, it's only for two years.
Then you can take a year off
and write your little old heart
out. After that, the New York
Philharmonic and the world debut
of Carl Herrick's "American
Opus". Then a command
performance for the President,
the Queen of England... The Ed
Sullivan Show. Then, someday,
after all those years of
struggle, if you're really lucky,
you'll be able to hear your
music on an elevator or in a
dentist's office.

INT. MUSIC ROOM, DAY
Herrick teaches his class.
HERRICK
If you combine two or more
melodies within a composition
you are using what is called a
counterpoint. There are a
variety of types of
counterpoint...
He goes through the motions -- the students do even less.
INT. HERRICK HOUSE, NIGHT
Iris works at the kitchen table, hand tinting a black and
white baby picture.
Herrick sits at the piano, trying to work. He stretches,
goes over to his record collection and finds an album. He
puts it on the stereo and plays some early Lester Young -then a little Dave Brubeck -- tasty jazz. He listens to
only a few bars, then hurries back to the piano and plays.
The few notes don't copy Young and Brubeck, but take the
music to another level. He makes notations, totally absorbed.
Iris watches him and smiles.
INT.

REHEARSAL ROOM, DAY

A kid does the scales on his trombone. Herrick listens with
all the patience he can muster, one eye on the clock.
HERRICK
All right, all right, Perry.
Nice tones, but you need a little
work on the right hand. Practice
the right hand so it flows.
You're jerking to each note -flow.
The kid packs up and leaves.
Herrick slumps, worn out.

HERRICK
Two years, two years... Only
two years.
There is a knock at the open door. Herrick looks up at
GERTRUDE VAN LENTE, 16, thick glasses, body like a broom
handle.
HERRICK
Can I help you?
GERTRUDE
I'm Gertrude Van Lente. I'm
going to learn to play the
clarinet.
HERRICK
Do you have a clarinet, Miss
Van Lente?
GERTRUDE
I had my daddy buy me one.
She opens a case and shows him her clarinet.
HERRICK
This is a very beautiful
instrument. Why did you pick
it? The clarinet?
GERTRUDE
I saw one on Lawrence Welk. It
was pretty -- the sound, I mean.
HERRICK
That's as good a reason as any.
What instruments have you played
before?
GERTRUDE
None, I can't even read music.
But I'm determined.
Herrick sighs.
INT. HERRICK HOUSE, NIGHT
Herrick is at the stereo -- first a little of Dvorak's
"American Quartet", then some "An American in Paris" by
Gershwin.
He goes back to his manuscript and reads. Grimacing, he
rolls it into a ball and throws it across the room -- hitting

equipment bag.
IRIS
Nice to see you, too.
HERRICK
Ah... I just spent three days
ripping off Dvorak and Gershwin.
IRIS
Well if you don't tell, I won't
either. I brought you some
wedding cake.
She puts away her cameras and equipment.
HERRICK
How was it?
IRIS
The groom was nervous, the bride
was scared. The mothers cried,
the fathers got smashed, I took
pictures and fought off the
best man. It was fun. How was
your day?
HERRICK
I start orchestra auditions
tomorrow. I have no strings or
woodwinds. I've got an accordion
that I'm sure of, if I can figure
out how to fit an accordion
into an orchestra -- oh, and a
third year tuba who's transferred
from another school.
IRIS
Well, you could always play
polkas.
That gets a smile from him.
INT. GYMNASIUM, DAY
There is a stage at one end of the gym, a circle of aspiring
musicians in chairs on it and music stands. Herrick tries
to conduct the auditions. It is a music lover's hell.
The notes are flat, discordant, downright ugly. Then a
flutist plays sweetly enough to bring a smile to Herrick's
face. But right after that is a trumpet player who bleats
like an injured goat. And it goes on and on.

Gertrude tries out and fails -- she has a long way to go.
The accordion player beams as he lays into "Lady of Spain".
Herrick just watches, frowning. The kid stops, puzzled,
then launches into a polka, grinning hugely. Herrick grabs
the accordion to stop him.
INT. MUSIC ROOM, DAY
Herrick passes out graded test papers.
HERRICK
I'm very disappointed in the
whole lot of you. These papers
are... dismal... This is all
simple stuff, basic music history
and theory...
The kids look at their grades with the same disgust.
HERRICK
What's going on here? Am I
talking to myself? I might as
well be.
Herrick sits behind his desk and looks at the kids.

Fine, this works. Why mess
around with all of that paperwork

The silence goes on for a long, uncomfortable moment.

Class dismissed. You can go,
but I expect things to be
different tomorrow. Understand
me?
It falls on deaf ears. The room is vacated instantly and
Herrick packs up his briefcase and leaves.

The hall is emptying quickly, kids grabbing their jackets,
slamming locker doors, full of energy for leaving. Hey,
school's out.

Herrick passes the rehearsal rooms, two cramped, sound-proof
rooms -- semi-sound-proof. He hears the pained notes of a
clarinet. Herrick opens the door and sees Gertrude.
HERRICK
Give it up, Miss Van Lente,
school's out.
Herrick startles her. He smiles and closes the door. The
clarinet scales continue as he walks away quickly. Principal
Wolters stops him.
WOLTERS
Mr. Herrick, just the man I was
looking for. We are forming a
textbook committee for next
year's curriculum and I was
hoping for your ideas.
HERRICK
Is this voluntary or required?
WOLTERS
It's totally voluntary, but
most important, Mr. Herrick.
HERRICK
Then I pass, Mr. Wolters. I
have a rule -- unless I get
paid for it I don't do it.
WOLTERS
Mr. Herrick, do you have another
job after school hours? I know
a teacher's salary isn't what
it should be, but...
HERRICK
No, I don't have a second job
and I agree on the salary. Can
I go now?
WOLTERS
I've been watching you, Mr.
Herrick. It's my job to keep
an eye on my teachers. I've
never seen a teacher who ran
out of here after the last period
with the enthusiasm of one of
our students. I wish I could
observe some of that enthusiasm
in your classroom work.

Herrick starts to walk away.

WOLTERS

Herrick stops and looks at Wolters.
HERRICK
Am I being made to stay after
school?
WOLTERS
I was wrong about this being a
job -- teaching is more. These
young people, your students,
are at a crossroads in their
lives. Confused, hormones going
berserk, faced with monumental
decisions that will change their
lives forever. And we try to
pump them full of dates and
formulas, figures and data,
that have little to do with
real life -- very little of it
takes.
(beat)
But it all adds up ... to a
human being with wants, needs,
ideals, and hopes. You have
two jobs. Pump them full of
data, music data in your case.
And give them a compass. Point
them in the right direction so
it doesn't all go to waste.
You manage to do that and they
will remember you for the rest
of their lives. I don't know
how you're doing with the data
input, but as a compass you're
useless.

Mr. Wolters. If I may leave...
Wolters lets Herrick pass.
INT. HERRICK HOUSE, NIGHT
Herrick makes meatloaf while Iris works with the enlarger.
He massages the egg and bread crumbs into the hamburger with
more vigor than necessary.
HERRICK
I hate that man and I hate his
school. The work is boring and
the kids are ignorant and
determined to stay that way.
IRIS
Let me do that, Carl.
HERRICK
No, I can't write when I feel
like this. I need to decompress.
IRIS
Well, it's taking longer for
you to decompress every night.
It's getting a little tired,
hon. You don't see me grousing
because I spend my days with
bawling babies and persnickety
mothers.
HERRICK
That's different, you like it.
IRIS
Yes, because I go into it saying
I'm going to have fun. I look
at every baby as if it's the
first one I ever saw -- as if
it were my own. And I pretend
that every mother is my own -that way I don't slap her.

Iris steps over to Herrick and puts her arms around him.
IRIS
Carl, you're not an old stuffed
shirt, not yet anyway. You
know more about the music these
kids listen to than they do.
And we've got the record
collection to prove it. I know,
I've toted it from apartment to
apartment for three years.
(beat)
You're not that much older than
them, but I've seen you in class.
It's like you're some old fuddyduddy.
HERRICK
Fuddy-duddy? A fine thing to
call your sex god.
IRIS
Don't try to change the topic
to sex, not yet at least. You
know what I'm saying -- you love
music. But you sure can't tell
it from your classes.
Herrick is about to argue, but he stops himself.
HERRICK
I know ... I don't know what to
do.
IRIS
You'll figure it out. You want
to talk about sex now?
HERRICK
I'd rather do...
The doorbell rings. Iris and Herrick look at each other.
The doorbell repeats. Herrick raises his meatloaf-covered
hands.
Iris goes to the door and returns with Gertrude Van Lente.
HERRICK
(surprised)
Miss Van Lente...
GERTRUDE
Good evening, Mr. Herrick. I
hope I'm not bothering you...

HERRICK
Not at all. Iris, this is
Gertrude Van Lente. Gertrude,
this is Iris, my wife.
Herrick wipes off his hands and leads Gertrude into the living
room. Iris looks at him, questioning. He shrugs back.
Gertrude walks over to the piano. She touches the keys
absently, looks at the sheet music.
GERTRUDE
Did you write this?
HERRICK
Yes, it's a symphony I'm
composing -- between meatloafs.
GERTRUDE
Oh...
HERRICK
Is there something you want..
GERTRUDE
You're right, Mr. Herrick. I'm
giving up the clarinet. I'm
doing what you told me. It's
for the best.
HERRICK
What I told you?
GERTRUDE
After school today. You said,
"Give it up". So I am, will...
HERRICK
I meant for the day.

I know what you meant. I'm
terrible, everybody says so.

HERRICK
Well, if that's what you want
to do...
Gertrude breaks into tears and walks toward the door. Herrick
pulls her back and into a chair. He looks to Iris for help.
She holds up her hands helplessly.
GERTRUDE
Oh, Mr. Herrick, what can I do?
I've got to learn something.

HERRICK
It's not such a bad thing, just
because you can't play the
clarinet. Lots of people can't
play any instrument.
Gertrude gets up and looks at him, tears in her eyes.
GERTRUDE
You don't understand, you don't
know my family. My sister
dances, she has a ballet
scholarship to Juilliard. My
brother is the top-seeded tennis
player in the state, sixth in
the country. My mother has won
the blue ribbon for watercolors
at the State Fair so many times
they've retired the category.
My father sings tenor in the
church choir and has sung the
National Anthem at Tiger Stadium
four times. And my name is
Gertrude.
Herrick is nonplussed for a moment.
HERRICK
You could call yourself Trudy.
GERTRUDE
Mr. Herrick, do I look like a
Trudy?
HERRICK
Well, keep at the clarinet.
You'll get there.
GERTRUDE
But all I make is noise. I do
ray scales, I practice until my
lips swell up, but it still
doesn't sound like anything.
HERRICK
I've heard you play -- you're
right, Gertrude. But ... well...
one of your problems is that
you only play the notes on the
page.
GERTRUDE
What else am I supposed to play?

He looks at her, then goes over to his record collection.
He sifts through a stack of 45's -- puts one on the turntable.
HERRICK
There's more to music than the
notes on the paper.
He lowers the needle and the unmistakable sounds of "The
Kingsmen" belting out "Louie, Louie" fill the room.
Gertrude looks at the turntable, at Herrick, dumbfounded.
HERRICK
Listen. These fellas have
absolutely no harmonic sense.
They can't sing, the lead singer
is yelling. They're playing
the same boring three chords
over and over and over. The
recording sucks. The lyrics
are awful when you can understand
them, if you can hear them.
This song is about a decibel
away from being noise. But we
love it. I love it! Do you
love it?
Gertrude nods.

Herrick is on a roll.

HERRICK
Why? I'll tell you why. Because
it has heart. These guys are
playing with everything they
have and they're having fun.
They love it, so we love it.
He takes one of Gertrude's hands and puts it over her heart.
HERRICK
Gertrude, you go home and pick
up your clarinet and play from
here. And who cares if it's

Herrick turns to find Iris staring at him.

IRIS
You live with someone, you sleep
with them, do neat things under
the covers ... and every once
in a while you look at them and
see why you ever went to a kegger

Is that some kind of half-assed

Proof?

I'll give you proof.

She hugs him.

He takes out his wallet and pauses.
HERRICK
Uh, I'm the music teacher out

Herrick stands in front of the classroom of dull faces.
HERRICK
Put your textbooks away. Okay,
how many of you like music?
After a moment, a couple of hesitant hands are raised.
HERRICK
How many of you like the Beach
Boys?
The kids look at each other and all the hands go up.
HERRICK
How many of you like this Beach
Boys song?
He puts a .45 on the record player and "Surfin' USA" starts
to play. The kids are roused from their trance.
HERRICK
How many of you knew that
"Surfing, USA" was a rip-off of
a song by Chuck Berry?
He changes the record and "Sweet Little sixteen" plays.
Some of the kids bounce to the music and all are paying
attention.
HERRICK
How many of you like this song
from a new English pop group
called "The Animals?
He plays "House of the Rising Sun".

He lays the needle on "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen.
HERRICK

link from the jazz scat singers
of the 30's to the doo-wop sound
of the 50's and 60's to this.
He lets the song play for a moment.
HERRICK
This catchy but inane repetition
of "bird, bird, bird, bird is a
word" disintegrates into "boppaboppa-boppa-boppa-oo-mau-maumau-boppa-oo-mau-mau-mau..."
He takes the needle off.
HERRICK
Well, maybe that's a bigger
leap of style than we should
attempt right now. Let's go
back to the Beach Boys and Chuck
Berry. Chuck Berry is one of
the founders of rock and roll.
Rock and roll has its' origins
in rhythm and blues. They go
back to the blues. So today we
will explore the blues.

flattened notes, usually thirds

ahead of myself. The opposite
of the diatonic scale is the
chromatic scale. We've covered
this already -- does anyone
know what a chromatic scale is?
He turns from the board and sees several eager hands go up.
He smiles -- this could be fun.
MONTAGE -Gertrude's fingers work the valves of her clarinet, going
through the scales. "C" is a bit tentative and falls somewhat
flat.
Herrick gets his class up to dance, chiding, begging, ordering
them to their feet as The Beach Boys' "Dance, Dance, Dance"

about jockey shorts riding up apply to him.

Everybody watch Perry! C'mon,

Even Herrick dances a little.
Gertrude tries for "D" -- better.

I never took your music classes,

so you're right there.
HERRICK
'65... We wrecked three cars
that year, some kind of record.
BOS
I always wondered why anyone
would teach Drivers Ed, they'd
have to be suicidal or something.
HERRICK
I was probably desperate for
the money. I needed every dime
I could get back then.
BOS
I know the feeling. Well... I
just wanted to say ... I heard
you was leaving and ... well,

Bos offers his hand and they shake.

Trying to parallel park, student jumps the curb. A student
piles a line of orange cones that make an obstacle course

A student makes a turn -- the wrong way onto a one-way street!
Herrick's foot hits the brake on his side of the car.
The car pulls out of a driveway -- right into the path of a
semi. The semi driver stomps on the brakes. The huge truck
slides to a stop, just kissing the fender of the Plymouth.
A student, using the rearview mirror, steps on the gas - and lurches forward. There is a crash.
Gears grind -- first, second, third -- and reverse.
The Drivers Ed car winds up -- in a ditch -- on a lawn -- on
top of a parking meter -- against a telephone pole -- stalled
on the railroad tracks (of course, a train is coming).
Parking in the school lot, a female student loses control,
feet scramble for the right pedals -- crash! Herrick's
Corvair has been hit. Herrick jumps out and stands in front

He sneers at the dog and goes to the door. It is the female

her new drivers license.
Herrick opens the screen door and the student gives him a

In this class we will study the
history of music. Not just
that classical long-hair stuff,
but American music, too. Folk,
blues, rock, jazz, country, and
pop. Some of these forms are
uniquely American, but our study
will be unbiased. All music is
good music. Some is formal,
some is complicated, some even
more complicated, but remember
... music is communication.
Not necessarily communication
of information, but of emotion,
feeling, mood. And if any piece
of music, any type of music
makes you feel something -- it
works. Now, how many of you
like this new British group,
the Beatles?
All the hands shoot up.
HERRICK
Well, before the Beatles wrote
"Yesterday", "Help", "A Hard
Day's Night", or any of their
other great songs, they covered -remade -- songs by other people.
How many of you have heard this
song?
He puts the needle down on "Roll over Beethoven" and lets it

HERRICK
This is their cover of a song
by Chuck Berry.
He plays a minute of the Chuck Berry version.
HERRICK
Chuck Berry is one of the fathers
of rock and roll. He comes
from a background influenced by
country and blues. Now the
blues, twelvebar blues, is a

Wind", the new Platters song, I
loved The Platters. Then I put

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD, DAY
The potential band members, with instruments, are standing
in rows at one end of the field. The football team practices
at the other end.
Herrick tries to line them up according to the book, trombones
in one row, drums at the back, etc., but the rows won't come
out even and he gives up on that.
He takes his position at the front of the band, raises the
baton, and gives the signal to march. The kids start walking,
some left foot first, some right. It looks like hell.
He stops them and tries again -- a little better -- a little
better still -- until they finally march in unison.
Herrick orders a left turn -- immediate chaos. Kids hit
each other with their instruments, trip over their own feet,
and pretty soon the whole band is down.
The football players laugh.
Herrick gets them to set their instruments aside, then back
in rows. They start marching once more. He orders a right
turn -- more chaos, even without instruments.
Herrick sighs, this is going to be a long road. The football
players start to heckle, but Meister shuts them up and walks

It is May and time for a parade. The sidewalks are lined

a lounge chair at the curb.
A band marches down the street playing "Seventy-Six

all-American kids. They pause in front of Iris and do a few
fancy steps and flourishes and move on -- very impressive.
The people applaud enthusiastically.
A float is next -- a salute to sugar beets.

Herrick composes at the piano. Iris is making a cradle from
an orange crate and two wooden coat hangers.
The baby is in a floor-mounted baby swing, being rocked with
Herrick's left foot. Herrick plays, slowly at first, then

There is a muffled, desperate conversation inside, shuffling

needs a haircut, his clothes are too small, and he is most
uncomfortable to see Herrick.
ED
Hi, Mr. Herrick.
HERRICK
Mr. Claypool, are your parents

ED
No, they got a couple days work
in Benton Harbor.
HERRICK
Oh, what kind of work?
ED
They haul scrap, old cars and
stuff. They got to pick it up

Herrick waits him out, also looking at the floor.
Then he sees it -- Ed Claypool's shoes. Old, ratty tennis

relative warmth of the trailer the snow on them has melted
and water squishes out of the holes.
Ed sees Herrick staring at his shoes.

Panicky, she catches Herrick's

She looks back at the audience -- and smiles. She looks
back at Herrick -- and smiles. He crosses his legs and shifts
in his chair. She turns back to the audience.
LOHMAN
I would like to begin by
paraphrasing a popular rock
song. So as not to offend the
more conservative members of
our audience I would like to
remind them that this song was
originally recorded by the folk

that offends you I'd like to
point out that the words were
taken from the Book of
Ecclesiastes, the Old Testament.
"To everything, there is a
season, turn, turn, turn. And

A time to gain, a time to lose.
A time to rend, a time to sew.
A time to love, a time to hate.

HERRICK
You're supposed to meet with
your counselor once a month.
You've skipped every one of our
sessions.
YNTEMA
I don't need any counselor,
man. I know what I need and it
isn't this school.
HERRICK
Look, Mr. Yntema, you're not
making any friends among the
teachers or staff -- obviously
you're doing no better with the
other students. Do you have
problems at home?

YNTEMA
I got problems here. Look,
when I left Grosse Pointe High
they'd skipped me ahead a grade.
Here, at Cowflop High they put
me back. What did I do to
deserve that?
HERRICK
I'm sorry, but Principal Wolters
doesn't believe in skipping
grades. He wants you to complete
four years of high school.
YNTEMA
Christ, you get time off for
good behavior even in prison.
HERRICK
Good behavior has not been your
strong suit.
YNTEMA
I get all A's, don't I? That's
all you should be interested
in. The rest is my business.
So leave me the hell alone.
And he walks away.

Herrick, frustrated, lets him.

INT. HERRICK HOUSE, NIGHT
Iris and Cole work on the wooden toys. Herrick grades papers.
He pauses a moment and watches them signing to each other,
fingers flying in conversation. They say something funny
and both laugh.
Herrick frowns and goes back to his papers.
INT. MUSIC ROOM, DAY
Herrick faces his class.
HERRICK
So, how can we tell what key a
piece of music is written in?
Hands go up.
HERRICK

YNTEMA

What a dipstick.
The rest of the class laughs and Tidd feels like shit.
HERRICK
You're so smart, Mr. Yntema, go
ahead and tell us.
YNTEMA
You count the number of flats
and sharps next to the time
signature.
It's the correct answer, but it doesn't please Herrick.
HERRICK
Fine... Are there any other
ways?
Several hands go up. Yntema looks at the others smugly,
inviting someone to wipe away his smirk with a fist.
INT. MUSIC ROOM, LATER
The bell rings.
HERRICK

Mr. Yntema, I'd like a word
with you.
Yntema, halfway to the door, saunters back.
until the others have left.
HERRICK
Mr. Yntema, I'm damn sick of
your smart mouth. You're smart,
everyone knows it, so shut the
hell up unless I ask you a
question. This is a music class
and I'm the teacher. You pay
attention... to me.
YNTEMA
What for? Look, I know all
this already. I know more about
music than any of these pinheads.
I don't need this.

Herrick waits

HERRICK
Then maybe I should turn over
the class to you,
YNTEMA
I wouldn't stoop that low.
Right now Herrick would like to hit this smart ass.
HERRICK
I'm about this close to
suspending you, Mr. Yntema.
YNTEMA
Look, Mr. Herrick, I can play
my scales backward and forward.
He demonstrates on the piano.
YNTEMA
I can recite all the names and
dates you want. I know the
Lydian mode, the Ambrosian chant
modes, the Gregorian modes. I
know the difference between
invertible counterpoint, strict
and free counterpoint. Just
give me the final and let me
out of here.
HERRICK
Music is more than that, it's a
language of emotion.
YNTEMA
Bullshit.
Herrick is pissed. A student pokes her head in the door,
enters and gives Herrick a note.
He glares at Yntema, fixing him on the spot, and reads the
note. The energy drains out of Herrick. He looks at the
girl who waits expectantly.
HERRICK
Please tell Mr. Wolters I'll
take care of it. I'll probably
send Bobby Tidd.
YNTEMA
The dipstick.
Herrick turns on Yntema so fast that Yntema ducks. Herrick
might hit him, wants to, but ... takes a breath. The girl
leaves.

HERRICK
Watch your mouth, Mr. Yntema.
YNTEMA
Look, I know this is a Liberal
Arts program, but I'm a Math
major. I plan to get my college
degree in economics. I already
have twelve college credits
from summer school.
HERRICK
We're talking about music.
YNTEMA
I know, the language of emotion
and that whole yawn. You know
what I think, Mr. Herrick,
emotions are part of our
Neanderthal past. We don't
need them. They just get in
the way of progress. We should
get rid of them -- and we
certainly don't need a language
for them.
Herrick is primed to argue, but looks at the note and stops
himself.
HERRICK
Meet me here tomorrow at ten
a.m.
YNTEMA
But tomorrow's Saturday.
HERRICK
Be here tomorrow or you've just
gotten your first "D", Mr.
Yntema. For attitude.
YNTEMA
You can't do that.
HERRICK
Try me.
Yntema looks at Herrick for a moment, decides not to press
his luck, and leaves.
Herrick falls into his chair and stares at the note.

It is Fall. Yntema waits by himself in front of the deserted
school. Herrick pulls up in the VW van and Yntema gets in.
EXT. HAVILAND CEMETERY, DAY
A military funeral, flag-draped coffin, color guard. Family
and friends are gathered around the grave. Herrick leads
Yntema to within a few yards.
YNTEMA
What are we doing here?
HERRICK
Just be quiet and listen.
The minister speaks in a low voice, the service already in
progress. Meister, in an ill-fitting suit, walks over to
Herrick. His hairline is starting to recede.
MEISTER
(noting Yntema)
Damn, Carl, you are a glutton
for punishment.
Meister and Herrick look over at the mourners.
MEISTER
Too bad ... Louie Rus. He was
on the wrestling team, you know.
Letter man three years running.
Good kid.
HERRICK
I know. He sent me a letter
only ... two months ago. He
was learning Vietnamese.
MEISTER

The noise

It is Bobby Tidd on a rise a short distance

Everyone cries. The stolid father, the drained mother, the
young wife with her child in his best Sunday suit. Family
and friends -- even Yntema.
HERRICK
That's Bobby Tidd on the bugle
... the dipstick. He's not as
smart as you are. He's not
that good on the horn, either,
he's lucky that bugle has only
one key. But he's playing well
today.

HERRICK
Louie Rus was his cousin. But
the point is ... that music
moved everyone. You didn't
even know Louie Rus and you had
a tear in your eye. Don't feel
embarrassed. That music has
had that effect for many, many
years. It expresses what we
are all feeling at this moment.
It spoke to us -- for us.
The flag is folded and presented to the widow.
HERRICK
The language of emotion. Louie
Rus worked very hard to learn
that language, very hard. Just
because it's easy for you -don't cheapen it.

Herrick walks

Yntema walks slowly over to where Bobby Tidd, in his best
suit, sits on a headstone.
Herrick looks over and sees Yntema offer Tidd his hand.
They shake. Herrick stands at the grave for a moment. The
grave diggers are waiting with their shovels. He finally
notices them and walks away.
Herrick walks through the cemetery, a small one, looking at
the headstones. Many of them have a common thread -- a
metallic American and Vietnamese flag crossed in the ground
in front of the marker. The dates on the headstones show
lives cut short. Young men cut down in the prime of their
lives, one after the other.
Herrick knew many of these young men. Finally, he can take
no more. He sits on the ground and cries.
INT. GYMNASIUM, DAY
"Good Luck Class of 1972". A good number of the students
wear black armbands over their graduation gowns, and buttons
that say, "Stop the War".
The ceremony is over and everyone is milling around. Back
slapping, hugs, tears, handshakes, and kisses. Flashbulbs
go off -- a Kodak contest.
Herrick is grabbed by one student after the other to pose
for a photo. Yntema and Tidd and other graduate run over
and lift their robes to their thighs.
YNTEMA/TIDD/GRADUATE
We don't have pants on!
And they run off looking for someone else to shock.
WOLTERS

Why tell me?
WOLTERS
You're surprised?
HERRICK
Well, yes, as a matter of fact.
WOLTERS
I don't know why, Mr. Herrick,
but -- you're my favorite
teacher.
Herrick is even more surprised.
WOLTERS
You're a hell of a teacher,
Carl. That's why I gave you
the hard cases, like Louie Rus,
Jill Lohman, Ed Claypool, Yntema

HERRICK
Well, thanks ... Mr. Wolters.
You'll be missed -- I, uh,
learned a lot from you.

they will behave properly.
Wolters slips a small box into Herrick's hand and melts away
into the crowd. Herrick opens the box -- a small, gold
compass.

Fejedelem looks around the room wistfully.
FEJEDELEM
You know, both me and my son

HERRICK
Yeah, Jay, we all do things we
regret later. We all wish we'd
done some things differently.
FEJEDELEM
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, we
were kids then, right? That
gives us some leeway.
HERRICK
That's right.
FEJEDELEM
Well, you take care. I'm around
for a while if you change your
mind about the boxes.
Fejedelem dusts his way back out.
Herrick continues sorting his things. He picks up the clear
plastic paperweight with the dandelion puff suspended inside.
He holds it up and looks at the delicate froth sealed forever.
He smiles, then his eyes become sad.

INT. HERRICK HOUSE, NIGHT
The living room is clattered with Iris' latest business
venture. There are jugs of liquid plastic resin, cans of
acetone, and stacks of molds spread out on a table. Flowers
dry suspended by their stems from a clothesline.
Flowers are also being placed in flat tubs of silica gel and
borax to dry. That's where Iris, Herrick, and ten-year-old
Cole are working right now.
IRIS
You should have been there.
The field was full of Queen
Anne's lace and brown-eyed
susans. Right in the middle
was this purple thistle and
Cole goes to get that when a
partridge just bursts out of
nowhere and scares the dickens
out of both of us. You should
have been there.
HERRICK
I told you we had a curriculum

IRIS
I know, I'm not trying to start
an argument. I was just...
I'll do the zinnias...
Iris reaches over to take several of the flowers from Herrick.
HERRICK
No, I've got them. I need some
more borax, ask Cole to get it.
Herrick touches Cole on the shoulder and points to Iris.
Iris signs to Cole, who goes into the kitchen and returns
with a box of borax. The interchange is routine -- Iris

INT. REHEARSAL ROOM, DAY
Students are gathered on folding chairs, a girl is at the
piano, and MRS. OLMSTEAD, the theater advisor, is running
the try-outs. Herrick watches from the sidelines.
MRS. OLMSTEAD
Since we've all decided to do a
musical for the Senior Play
this year, and because I can't
carry a tune in a bushel basket,
I've asked Mr. Herrick to help
us out. We will begin the tryouts with the role of Maria.
Oh, we're putting on "West Side
Story", but you all know that,
don't you? So let's see, we'll
start with Ardeth Huizenga.
Ardeth gives her music to the pianist -- and sings -- sort
of. You could get a prettier sound from a cat in a Cuisinart.
Next
-- a 'Maria' from hell, she yells the lyrics.
-- flat, off-key, and can't remember the lyrics to a Bee
Gees song.
-- a pretty face, but a voice like Ernest Borgnine.
-- too shy to sing loud enough to be heard.
-- breaks into giggles every other line.
-- Grace Slick doing "West Side Story".
-- too many opera lessons.
And then -- ROWENA DENEVE sings the hell out of "Somewhere".
Herrick, nodding off in boredom, is suddenly awake. And she
looks as pretty as her voice -- young, confident, the sound
of an angel. She finishes.
HERRICK
That was very nice Miss...
DeNeve. Very nice. DeNeve...

HERRICK

IRIS
Sure... for one of your Oliver

HERRICK
Yeah. He has a chance for a

smiles that drives lesser men mad.
Meister sits next to Herrick. He's beginning to show a little
potbelly and his hairline has begun an unstoppable retreat.
He sees the look between Herrick and Rowena.

Carl, but does the phrase "jail
bait" apply here?
Herrick gets the hint -- he stares at Meister angrily.
MEISTER
It's just, you know, putting my
nose where it don't belong, I
know. It's not like I have
pretty young girls knocking on

Herrick looks at Iris, ready to argue, but he changes his
mind and looks at his son's gift. A dandelion puff suspended
in plastic -- delicate, beautiful.
IRIS
It was hard. He tried again
and again, but the dandelions
kept falling apart when they
hit the plastic. Some of those

one. For you! Why, I'll never

get out and walk toward the gymnasium with other adults and
students.

I'm not riding in that death
trap. One of these days you'll

The usual folding chairs have been moved back from the stage,
leaving room for two rows of huge Marshall speakers. On top
of each speaker is a plywood platform with a chair.
Cole and other deaf children are shown to the chairs on the
speakers. The rest of the audience take their places toward
the back.
The orchestra is soon ready and Herrick steps to the podium.
A sign language interpreter stands to one side of the stage.
HERRICK
Thank you all for coming.
Tonight is an experiment... I
hope it works. I had prepared
a big speech about the importance
of music in our world, but it
went on for pages and pages.
So, I decided the best way to
explain music to the hearing
impaired is to give it to you
and let you make of it what you
will.
(beat)
Our first selection this evening
is by George Gershwin, "Rhapsody
in Blue". In this music Gershwin
was trying to give us his
impression of the city of New
York. Here we go.
He faces the orchestra and raises his baton. And the music
begins. From the instruments, into the microphones, through
the amplifiers, and out of the Marshall speakers. The chairs
on top of the speakers vibrate with the music.
The gorgeous Gershwin sound fills the room.
Cole holds onto his chair and his eyes widen. He and the
other kids look at each other. And each one begins to smile.
They can feel the music! It courses through their bodies!
Herrick looks over his shoulder at Cole -- it's working!
The deaf children begin to sway to the music.
INT. GYMNASIUM, LATER
Herrick stands at the podium.

Lennon and McCartney, with or
without the Beatles. So, for
our final selection tonight, we
would like to perform a song by
John Lennon...
Herrick hands the baton to the student conductor.
HERRICK
And, uh, for the hearing impaired
in our audience, this may be
the one time you are grateful
for your hearing difficulties -I am going to sing. To the
hearing portion of our audience,
my profound apologies.
A ripple of laughter runs through the audience.

Iris is

HERRICK
And ... on a personal note...
I'd like to dedicate this to my
son, Cole.
Herrick nods to the student conductor. The music begins.
Herrick begins to sing -- not a good voice, but sincere.
HERRICK
(singing)
Close your eyes, Have no fear,
The monster's gone. He's on
the run and your daddy's here.
Beautiful,
Beautiful, beautiful,
Beautiful boy.
As Herrick sings, he signs the words! He sings to Cole,
whose eyes well with tears. Iris is crying.
Herrick stumbles here and there, but he manages to sing and
sign the words of this touching tribute by John Lennon to
his son.
HERRICK
Before you cross the street
Take my hand.
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy
Making other plans.
Beautiful,
Beautiful,
Beautiful boy.

HERRICK (CONT'D)
Darling,
Darling,
Darling, Cole.
The audience breaks into applause. But Cole and Herrick
just look at each other, oblivious to the others. They just
look at each other, both in tears.
EXT. KENNEDY HIGH, NIGHT
Herrick shakes hands with people as they leave the concert.
A lot of thanks and congratulations. Medill, the owner of
the music store, slaps Herrick on the back.
MEDILL
Chairs an top of speakers,
Herrick. One chair falls
through, that's a couple of
grand down the toilet. Great
show.
Herrick watches Iris and Cole talking animatedly next to the
VW van.
Medill shakes Herrick's hand and he's the last person out.
Herrick, rather full of himself, walks over to the parking
lot.
Iris and Cole are already inside when Herrick opens the door
and gets in.
INT. VW VAN, NIGHT
Iris drives.

Herrick leans back to talk and sign to Cole.

HERRICK
What say we to the drag races
this season, huh, Cole? Cha
Cha Muldowney! Cha ... Cha...
Herrick has trouble signing "Cha Cha"
COLE
(signing)
I can read your lips.
HERRICK
Right.
So what about it?

COLE
Maybe.
Maybe?

HERRICK
You love the drags.

IRIS
Don't push it, Carl.
HERRICK
Don't push it? What's wrong
here?
IRIS
What you did tonight was very
nice... it was beautiful, Carl,
really.
COLE
But it doesn't make up for
everything else.
HERRICK
I ... I know that. I don't
expect to clean the slate in
one night. But it's a start,
isn't it? I mean ... a person
should get a second chance,
shouldn't they? We all screw
up. We should get another
chance, a chance to change.
Herrick's appeal is heartfelt.
HERRICK
A second chance. Then if they
blow it -- shut them out. But
a person should get a chance.
(beat)
I'd give it to you. Iris?
IRIS
Carl, I'm not the one you should
ask.
HERRICK
Cole? Please. I can't make
everything up to you, but I
can...
COLE
We will go to the drag races.
HERRICK
And more.

EXT. HERRICK HOUSE, NIGHT
The van pulls up. Cole is out first.
Herrick and Iris follow slowly.

He goes into the house.

IRIS
He's a good kid.
HERRICK
Yes, he is. Thanks to you. By
the way, what's this mean? I
can't find it in any of the
books.
He taps his temple with his fist, thumb extended.
IRIS
Uh... it means ... asshole.
Herrick laughs.
Asshole!

HERRICK
Hah! I can use that.

A Spring weekend. The garage door is open to the fresh air.

INT. GYMNASIUM, NIGHT
The Senior Prom is in progress. A student disk jockey plays
the latest hits of 1981. Kids dance in their formals and
tuxes.
The song ends and Herrick takes the stage.
HERRICK
We have a special treat for you
Seniors tonight. A group of
our own students has been
persuaded to make their
professional debut right here
at Kennedy High. Ladies and
gentlemen, the Sex Dwarfs!
And the curtain parts to show Schiff, Goodrich, and Groves
in their leather best. Guitar, bass, and drums.
They launch into "Louie, Louie" -- particularly raucous and
obnoxious, but faithful somehow to both Black Flag and the
Kingsmen.
Principal Kiernan and Coach Meister both turn on Herrick,
who beams proudly.
INT. HERRICK HOUSE, DAY
Herrick is reading the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code, newly
revised for 1981.
Cole walks in and out, humming something that sounds barely

EXT. ROAD, DAY
The Corvair jerks along the road, Cole at the wheel.
INT. MUSIC ROOM, 1994
Herrick takes the glass treble clef off the window, deep in
thought. He is jerked back to the present by the Corvair
pulling up outside.
The Corvair has been restored beautifully, perfectly. A
twenty-eight year-old Cole gets out of it. He sees Herrick
at the window.
He bows and waves his hand at the Corvair -- Ta Dah!
Herrick claps his hands so Cole can see. He puts the treble
clef in the box and looks around the room.
Iris is sitting in the back working on a needlepoint project.

IRIS
A while.
Are you ready to go?

Yes, I guess so. What are you

All right, you can drive it on

it back by eleven. Need help

HERRICK

No, I can manage. You didn't
have to come.
COLE
Didn't want an old fart like
you to strain himself.
Cole picks up a box, Herrick the briefcase, and they head
out.
HERRICK
Oh, my keys!
He goes back and gets his keys off the desk. Herrick pauses
and looks over the room that was his for thirty years.
He sees faces at the desks, young faces. Gertrude Van Lente,
Louis Rus, Jill Lohman, Ed Claypool, Yntema, Tidd, Rowena,
Schiff, Goodrich, Groves, and many more. Ghostly faces, his
former students. His memories. He leaves.
INT. HALLWAY
Their footsteps echo in the empty hall.
Herrick hears something.
HERRICK
What was that?
BOOMP!

BOOMP!

BOOMP!

Somebody is pounding on a piano.

HERRICK
Somebody's fooling around in
the gymnasium.
IRIS
Leave it be, Carl.

Herrick walks toward the gymnasium.

Besides, that piano is just one
step away from firewood as it
is.
Cole and Iris follow Herrick to the gym.

He enters.

"Louie, Louie" fills the air, played by the school band.
The gymnasium is full, crammed to the rafters with students
and townsfolk.
There is a banner over the stage -- "Good-bye, Mr. Herrick".
Herrick is overwhelmed. Meister takes his briefcase and
Principal Kiernan escorts him toward the stage.
People reach out of the audience to shake his hand. Soon we
recognize older versions of Schiff, Goodrich, Groves -Lohman, Ed Claypool, Yntema, then Tidd -- maybe a very womanly
Rowena near the back.
Mrs. Kiernan leads Herrick up the steps to the stage, to the
podium in front of the band.
A stunned Herrick looks for Iris.

She and Cole wink at him.

The applause finally dies down and Mrs. Kiernan addresses
the crowd.
MRS. KIERNAN
I've only been here, what,
thirteen years already? But
when the word got out that the
Music Program was cut, and about
the subsequent retirement of
our Mr. Herrick ... well, I
have never seen such a response
from this community -- never.
So we put together a little
send-off.

MRS. KIERNAN (CONT'D)
We were going to buy you
something, Carl, a watch, or
whatever... We asked your wife
Iris what you might want or
need, she was no help at all.
(beat)
The one thing she did mention
was your writing. And I remember
all those school board meetings,
faculty meetings, and so on. I
always saw you scribbling away,
what I thought were pertinent
notes, but I looked over your
shoulder once and discovered it
was quarter-notes and flats. I
was so glad when you finished
the damned thing so you could
concentrate on your teaching
again.
There is good-nature laughter from the audience.
MRS. KIERNAN
Seriously, though, I don't think
I have ever come across a more
dedicated, selfless teacher.
The only way we can ever pay
you back is to perform, for the
first time, "The American Opus",
by Carl Herrick.
She hands him the baton.

He turns to the orchestra.

The instruments are poised and ready.
He looks down at the music stand.
The sheet music is a copy of the original, in his handwriting.
"The American Opus" by Carl Herrick. He touches the sheets
of music, looks at Iris. His Iris. He loves this woman.
She motions him to get on with it.
Then raises the baton, taps it once on the music stand and
... the orchestra plays. The opening strains of the music
fill the gym.
Herrick's face glows and his chest fills with pride.
There is a quiet murmur in the audience behind him. It gets
louder, disrupting the music. Herrick looks over his
shoulder.
Two Highway Patrolmen can be seen in the back of the
gymnasium.

The murmur in the audience increases. A few words are
audible. "The Governor ... "It's the Governor!" "Here!"
"Where?" "I can't see ... " "Look, over there!"
Herrick drops his baton and the music peters out.
The two Highway Patrolmen walk down the aisle ahead of a
middle-aged woman in glasses. She is followed by two more
Highway Patrolmen and a couple of staff members.
She strides up the stage.
startled.

Principal Kiernan takes the podium,

MRS. KIERNAN
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
present our Governor ... and
former Kennedy High School
alumna, the Most Honorable
Gertrude Van Lente.
By God, it is Gertrude. She takes the microphone, waits for
the applause to die down.
GERTRUDE
Thank you, Principal Kiernan.
I'm sorry I arrived late and
spoiled the music, but we'll
get right back to it. I came
here today to say my thanks to
Mr. Carl Herrick. I remember
him well... He had a great
influence on my life. On a lot
of lives, I know. And I have
the feeling that Mr. Herrick
considers a great part of his
life was misspent. He wrote
this symphony of his to be
performed, possibly to make him
famous or rich, probably both.
That is the American dream...
that is how we measure success,
by being rich and famous. On
that scale, Mr. Herrick is a
failure -- but I think he has
achieved a success beyond riches
and fame. Look around you, Mr.
Herrick. There is not a life
in this room that you have not
touched. And each one is a
better person for meeting you,
or being your student. This is
your symphony, Mr. Herrick.
These people are the notes and
melodies of your opus. And
this is the music of your life.

The audience gives Herrick a standing ovation. He looks out
at the audience, each face a memory, a moment of his life.
GERTRUDE
One last thing, Mr. Herrick.
As long as I am Governor of
this State there will always be
a Music Program in the High
Schools. Let's get back to the
music. Mr. Herrick...
Herrick steadies himself and goes back to the orchestra.
raises the baton. The music begins again.

He

It is a great symphony with elements of jazz, rock, country,
tin pan alley, and classical. Gertrude goes over to one of
the girls playing the clarinet and whispers in her ear.
And she takes the clarinet, takes the student's seat, and
plays.
Then, out of the audience, one or two at a time, other adults
approach the stage and -- one by one -- replace the students
in the orchestra.
Eventually the orchestra is composed completely of adults.
Herrick cries openly as he leads them.
And in the audience, resting in Iris, lap, is the needlepoint -words encircled by twining ivy -"Life Is What Happens
While You Are Making
Other Plans"
