EXT. HARBOR - DAY
The South American harbor is crammed with freight ships.
DOCKWORKERS climb the ramps with bags of coffee beans.
Cranes unload boxes of Japanese coffeemakers.
CUT TO:
EXT. BAR DISTRICT - DAY
The narrow street is lined with garish bars. Half-nude
HOOKERS lean over balconies and call down to passing
SHIPMATES. More hookers, escaping the tropical heat,
sit in doorways and fan themselves to the Salsa MUSIC
from all the bars.
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY
Tapping to the music are a man's feet in sandals and a
gold ankle chain. His linen trousers are rolled up in
the heat. Dyed in his silk shirt are small faces of
Rita Hayworth.
He is LEWIS MOLINA, 58, an American who has lived here
since jumping ship at 19. His hair is tinted to hide
the gray. He has the weathered face of a man who has
seen it all, and been hurt by most of it.
As the camera moves from his feet to his face, we hear
Molina reading in a rather effeminate voice.
MOLINA
He says he can't come back for
Christmas like he promised ... and
he's very sorry he hasn't seen his
new son yet... and he loves you
with all his heart.
Spread across his table are envelopes and stamps. A
WOMAN of the district listens to him with quiet dignity.
She has a baby on her lap and a four-year-old boy at her
side.
WOMAN
So he won't come at all this year.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
(holds back tears)
What about money for the children?
MOLINA
Sorry.
He doesn't say.
(turns to bar)
Gabriel! Did you forget my iced
tea?
(turns to woman)
Do you want to write him back?
The woman is too sad to answer. The boy fiddles with
his Star Wars toy. Molina moistens a pen with his tongue
and begins to write.
MOLINA
Dear Peter, the boys and I were
delighted to get your thoughtful
card ...
A ship horn BLARES over the music. As Molina writes, we
see the interior of his hang-out and 'office.'
The restaurant is divided by a folding partition, painted
with jungle leaves and spider webs. One side is a bar
with weary dockworkers. The other side is a modest dining
room with SHIPS OFFICERS at clean tablecloths.
GABRIEL, 35, a handsome waiter in a tunic, moves through
the tables with a tray of dirty dishes. His well-dressed
WIFE, waiting impatiently at the kitchen window, resumes
her harangue.
WIFE
I told you last week, the deadline
is today. If we don't pay by 5:30,
the girls will miss a whole
semester.
Saying nothing, Gabriel puts an iced tea on his tray.
WIFE
Are you listening!

GABRIEL
Your tea, Molina. Sorry it took
so long.
MOLINA
That's okay.
(returns to letter)
Remember, dearest Peter, I am your
woman, who misses you more than
life itself, who lives only for
the blessed moment of your return.
I save all my love for you alone.
Your beloved -(looks up)
What was your name, darling?
WOMAN
Please, Senhor Molina.

I will

Molina is miffed.
Okay.

MOLINA
If you think that's better.

The woman pays the fee and leaves. Gabriel, waiting
nearby, looks uneasy as he leans forward.
GABRIEL
Molina, could I ask you a small
favor? It's only a hundred. For
my kid's school. (indicates wife)
She has the money, but she says a
father should provide these things.
Molina takes out a hundred, leaving only twenty for
himself. Gabriel accepts it with grateful dignity.
GABRIEL
Thank you, Molina. I'll pay you
back next month.

Molina watches him approach his angry wife.
MOLINA
Bitch.
CUT TO:
EXT. BAR DISTRICT - NIGHT
Although the bars are closed, the narrow street still
swelters in the heat. Molina and Gabriel stroll past
hookers lingering in the shadows.
MOLINA
I'll never understand. How can a
man with your intelligence work in
a dump like that?
GABRIEL
It's life, Molina.
MOLINA
No, it's a shame. With your looks
and charm, you should work in a
chic restaurant. In a big
international hotel. Making three
times what you get in that
stinkhole.
GABRIEL
You think I haven't tried?
They turn a corner and approach the bus-stop.
MOLINA
Look, when I brought my mother
down from Miami, she worked the
switchboard at the Copacabana
Palace. She still knows the
manager. She'll introduce you,
and poof. A new life.
GABRIEL
Forget it, Lewis. I can't even
speak English.
The bus approaches.

MOLINA
(quickly)
I'll pay for your lessons. We can
practice everyday. It's perfect,
you'll learn in no time.
GABRIEL
Talk is cheap, eh Molina?
MOLINA
I can afford it. Really.
GABRIEL
(boards the bus)
See you tomorrow.
MOLINA
Goodnight, Gabriel. Kiss the
children for me.
Molina watches the bus pull away. Several TOUGH TEENAGERS
stand in front of a run-down movie theater. One BOY,
16, stares at Molina. Their eyes meet.
CUT TO:
INT. MOLINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Molina, exhausted, enters his dimly-lit parlor. The
late-night TV broadcasts a test pattern. His MOTHER,
81, wakes up on the sofa. They speak in English.
MOLINA
Mama, you should be in bed. Why
don't you listen to the doctor?
MOTHER
What time is it?
MOLINA
Long past your bedtime.
I'll help you.

Of course not, Mama. Just go to

EXT. BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY
CUT TO:
Molina sips coffee at his regular "desk" on the patio.
A police car pulls to a stop. A POLICE OFFICER gets out
and approaches Molina's table.
OFFICER
Good morning, Molina. How's it
going?
MOLINA
Not bad.
The officer sits down and fingers Molina's papers and
pens.
OFFICER
How's business?
MOLINA
Slow.
I need more coffee.

You want some?

OFFICER
You don't have time.
(points)
Recognize the kid in the car?
Molina squints at the police car. In the backseat is
the 16-year-old boy (from last night) with his FATHER.

VOICE A
Forget it, I'm too tired. Just

CUT TO:
INT. CELL - NIGHT
The stark cell door has a steel door and one small window
with bars. Molina sits on a prison bed and speaks
directly into the camera.

Now we see that Molina is addressing someone.

in the torture room. The CAMERA CONTINUES from boots to

She doesn't dare worry him when
he's so sick.
The cell-mate rolls over with his eyes open. He is
VALENTIN ARREGUI, 32, thin and unshaven. His arms show
the marks of torture. He has the intense look of a man
who has been hurt in more ways than one.

INT. FISHERMAN'S SHACK - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)
Coughing, the tubercular Young Man struggles to his feet

VOICE OF MOLINA
One night her lover is feeling a
little better and decides to meet
her after work at the hotel.
Leaving, the young man blows out the candle.
CUT TO:
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)
The Young Man speaks to the DOORMAN at the large hotel.
The Doorman gives him a cigarette and matches.
VOICE OF MOLINA
The doorman tells him that she
hasn't worked there for quite a
while. He asks for a cigarette
even though he knows smoking is
suicide for a man with T.B.
CUT TO:
EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)
The gaunt Young Man sees several PROSTITUTES under a
street lamp, calling out to passing cars.
VOICE OF MOLINA
In desperation he walks street
after street until, finally, he
sees her on a corner. She is
wearing a gaudy outfit and flirting
with an old man in a car. He
suddenly realizes what she's been
hiding from him: she was selling
her body to save his life.
The young man, crying, takes a deep drag on his cigarette.

Molina, playing the role of the young man, pretends to
cry with a cigarette. Valentin struggles to his feet
and goes to the shit-bucket in the corner.
MOLINA
Do you like it?
VALENTIN
Leave me alone, man. I need to
build my strength.
MOLINA
Just tell me if you like it.
Valentin, exhausted by torture, leans against the wall
as he urinates.
VALENTIN
Now that it's over, it seems like
the lovers are dead.
MOLINA
It's not over yet, my dear.
VALENTIN
Shit.
CUT TO:
INT. FISHERMAN'S SHACK - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)
The WOMAN (who was dressed as a hooker) arrives home in
normal clothing. Seeing his empty bed, she rushes into
the kitchen.
On the table are a plate full of cigarette butts and an
empty bottle of rum. Then she sees his note by the
window.
VOICE OF MOLINA
Instantly she realizes that he
knows her secret. She finds his

Valentin looks at him with disgust.

VALENTIN
No, I can't be listening to this
junk during the day. I've got
important things to think about.
MOLINA
Tomorrow night, then.

Sweet dreams.
CUT TO:

INT. CELL - DAY
Valentin reads a paperback entitled Third World
Economics. Molina, like an actor, uses a mirror and
lipstick to apply a light rouge on his cheeks.
MOLINA
Tell me about your girlfriend.
You do have one, don't you?
VALENTIN
Leave me alone.
MOLINA
Of course, you do. What's the big
secret? Is she involved in a
scandal?
Valentin glares up from his book.
VALENTIN
It's none of your business.

That's my problem.

SOUNDS of crowds, military drums,

VOICE OF MOLINA
The air is charged with excitement
as they march under the Arch of
Triumph.
PAN DOWN the Arch of Triumph to reveal columns of NAZI
TROOPS.
VOICE OF MOLINA
Wearing their marvelous uniforms.
So perfect, so clean. Battalions
of totally blonde, invincible
supermen!
Through a series of shots, we move from the parade to an
average French working-class neighborhood.
The images look like a slapdash German film of the 1940's.
More specifically, a Nazi propaganda movie.
VOICE OF MOLINA
Forget what you read in the history
books. The truth is, the French
welcomed the Germans with open
arms.
As two FRENCHMEN unload a truck at a hardware store, a
NAZI CONVOY appears. German troops arrest the two men,
and find others hiding in the cellar. One is shot trying
to escape, the others surrender. They are Jews.

VOICE OF MOLINA
Oh, there were a few who didn't
appreciate them, but for the most
part, the French cheered because
they were saving France from
disaster and starvation.
WERNER, a handsome Gestapo officer, whispers to an AIDE.
A neighborhood crowd spits on the smugglers. German
troops break open the cargo and distribute the contraband
food. A grateful OLD WOMAN kisses Werner's hand.
A pickup truck stops in an alley and watches the crowd.
VOICE OF MOLINA
A small truck watches from nearby.
Inside are these two French thugs
from the Resistance. The driver
is a hulking cross-eyed Flunky.
His boss is a grimy little Clubfoot.
Their truck is loaded with
delicacies like canned meats and
cognac. These Resistance goons
are shameless black-marketeers.
Simply shameless.

Valentin sits up.
VALENTIN
You mean the Nazis are the good

Every night, a ravishing young

German High Command.
LENI, a stunning brunette dressed in elegant black,
appears in the spotlight.
VOICE OF MOLINA
She is Leni Lamaison. A Grace
Kelly with the voice of a Piaf.
VOICE OF VALENTIN
Grace who?
VOICE OF MOLINA
Anyway...
(sighs)
The lyrics portray a sweet innocent
nightingale, taken prisoner from
its nest by a fierce brutal eagle.
Can you imagine her courage, singing
this in public during the German
Occupation? And to top it off,
she descends the stage steps and
finishes her song right in front
of Werner's table. Werner! A man
no woman can resist. Totally
heartless. But inside, a volcano.

Sure, it's better than a tampax

Molina recoils and quickly regroups.

But propaganda is just dandy when
it serves your stinking revolution.

Now could you know anything about
revolution? You're just a damn
queen.

And how could you know anything if
you're so damn prejudiced?.

VALENTIN
Look, in order to live with myself,

Working for that is my only

I've called five million times.
Carnival is finally here, and look
at you! And now you feed me this
dish about a trip?
MOLINA
Greta, darling, I trust you. Please
trust me. I know what I'm doing.
(hands brown
envelope)
For Mama. This will take care of
her while I'm gone. Please.
GRETA
All right, I'll handle it. Wherever
you're going, it's probably for
the best. But please, Louisa, at
least take a bath.
CUT TO:
INT. MOLINA'S BATHROOM - DAY
Molina steps from the steamy shower, checks his wrinkles
in the mirror and dabs shaving cream on his face.
CUT TO:
INT. MOLINA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Molina, dressed in his finest, scrutinizes himself in a
full-length mirror. He is clean shaven and immaculately
groomed. He carefully adjusts a red scarf around his
neck. Finally satisfied, he leaves his apartment.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Molina sits beside his sleeping mother.
MOLINA
Mama, you look so beautiful.
(whispers)
You remember, Mama, when I was
little and you'd come into my room
to kiss me good-night.
(kisses her cheek)
I always pretended to be asleep,
but I was waiting for your kiss.
Although you're sleeping now, I
know you understand me.
(touches her face)
It's time for me to take care of
my own life. You do understand,
don't you, Mama? Please don't be
sad.
A NURSE approaches.
NURSE
She's been in a coma for two days.
I know.

MOLINA
Leave us, please.

He kisses his mother on the forehead.

INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY
The black sedan creeps through dense carnival throngs.
Pedro, straining, watches Molina thread his way through
the crowd.
PEDRO (V.O.)

of erratic activities. One, suspect

spots Molina turning into a shopping
arcade.
CUT TO:
EXT. ARCADE - DAY
Molina runs along the mall and ducks into a boutique.
Looking in a display mirror, he SEES: the black sedan
stops at the arcade entrance; one MAN gets out; the car
drives away.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - DAY
The street is a cacophony of fire-crackers and Samba
bands. Molina pushes through dancing throngs in their
exotic costumes. A costumed STREET PEDDLER tries to
badger him.
PEDDLER
Take home a Grate-All for the little
lady! The great Grate-All grates
anything -- cheese, soap, potatoes,
even your mother-in-law.
Molina pushes an to the edge of the plaza.
CUT TO:
EXT. PLAZA - DAY
Molina sees a young woman step from a car across the
plaza. He hurries forward. She kisses the driver who
pulls away.
Molina stops at the plaza fountain, wipes the sweat from
his face and scans the crowd.

A taxi stops near the fountain. The two passengers are
a YOUNG MAN and YOUNG WOMAN. They smile and wave for
him to approach.
Molina stens forward nervously. He leans toward the
window and sees the Young Man holds a pistol.
YOUNG MAN
Who are you?
MOLINA
I have a message from Valentin.
YOUNG MAN
Get in.

Quick.

Molina grabs the doorknob. But the Street Peddler,
leaping forward, plows him aside and thrusts a revolver
in the window.
The Young Man fires two quick shots, twisting the Peddler
sideways and slamming him to the pavement. Molina
stumbles into the stunned crowd.
The taxi bolts away. Undercover Agents rush forward and
shoot rapid-fire at the taxi careening through horrified
merrymakers.
CUT TO:
EXT.

ALLEY - DAY

Molina, limping, hurries along the dark alley. Pedro
and three Agents round the corner and chase him with
their guns drawn.
PEDRO
Stop!

Molina!

Bystanders scatter. Molina keeps moving. Pedro
rapidfires three shots. Molina blasted twice in the
back, plunges to his hands and knees. Pedro dashes to
catch up.
Molina, gasping, struggles to his feet and staggers along
the dark wall to the sun-lit street.

The only SOUND

VOICE OF MOLINA
What have they done to you,
Valentin?
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
A dog sniffs a pile of slum rubbish. Tires screech; a
car door flings open; a body tumbles onto the rubbish.
The car roars away. The dog returns and sniffs the
corpse. It is Molina.
VOICE OF VALENTIN
What have they done to you, Molina?
CUT TO:
INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - DAY
Valentin, delirious, lies on a cot in the small first
aid room. His face is swollen with bruises. His chest
is disfigured by third-degree burns.

A male INTERN approaches with a hypodermic needle.
INTERN
It's morphine. It'll make it hurt
less, so you can get some rest.
Nod your head if you want it.
(Valentine nods)
Okay, count to forty. Listen,
don't tell about this or I'll lose
my job. God, the way they worked
you over, it's barbaric.
(finishes)
There. It'll ease the pain in
just a minute and you'll be able
to sleep.

Her hand tugs his toward the door.
CUT TO:
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - SURREAL
The prison corridor, like a long tunnel, is strangely
dark with a door of glowing light at the end.
The shadowy nude silhouettes of Valentin and Marta move
toward the light.
VOICE OF MARTA
Come, Valentin, come with me.
Don't be afraid. You won't wake

CUT TO:

EXT. JUNGLE BEACH - DAY
Their silhouettes push through the shadowy leaves. It
is the same jungle that was in Molina's movie about the
Spider Woman.
VOICE OF MARTA
Hurry, Valentin. They won't find
you here.
VOICE OF VALENTIN
But Molina is dead.
VOICE OF MARTA
Don't be sad, my love. Only he
knows if he died sad or happy.
Still holding hands, they emerge from the jungle and see
the beautiful sun-lit beach with the water-logged rowboat.
Their silhouettes run across the beach into the ocean.
They embrace in the water.
VOICE OF VALENTIN
Don't leave me.
VOICE OF MARTA
Nothing can separate us now.
VOICE OF VALENTIN
Oh how much I love you. That's
the one thing I've never said,
because I'm so afraid of losing
your love forever.
VOICE OF MARTA
That will never happen here. This
dream is short, but this dream is
happy.
They kiss again, then gaze at the sparkling horizon.
