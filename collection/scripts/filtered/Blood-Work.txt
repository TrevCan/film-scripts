BLOOD WORK

EXT. CRIME SCENE (SILVERLAKE) - NIGHT

A media and spectator circus. Two cocky LAPD detectives,
ARRANGO and WALTERS, watch as FBI profiler TERRY McCALEB
strides past the police barricades. Wearing a blue FBI
jacket, the hoary veteran ignores questions shouted out
by the press. The words "Code Killer" feature
prominently.
ARRANGO
(disparaging)
McCaleb... Whatever happens, it’s
his face on the front page.
As McCaleb reaches Arrango:
McCALEB
What do you got?
ARRANGO
Fucking hemorrhoids. What are you
gonna do about it?
Arrango’s itching for trouble.
WALTERS
Victims five and six.
killer strikes again.

Walters is a cooler head.
The code

INT. TENEMENT - ENTRY HALLWAY - NIGHT
A dingy, dark place. Police work lights can’t quite cut
the gloom. McCaleb stops at the door with Walters and
Arrango. The door is half off its hinges.
WALTERS
Neighbor came over to complain
about the noise. Got run over at
the door. Didn’t see a thing.
ARRANGO
We’re calling him Chuck Taylor.
McCALEB
How’s that?
Arrango points out a series of bloody sneaker prints on
the floor. Headed for the door and away down the hall.
ARRANGO
Converse hi-tops. Chuck Taylor.
Get it?
A look and McCaleb continues in past them.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Not for the faint of heart. There are several darkened
forms on the floor. Heavy, black plastic bags. An
investigative team works.
WALTERS
We got the remains of two, maybe
even three people.
ARRANGO
Gives new meaning to the term gang
bang.
Gruff, desensitized laughs from the cops. Walters
motions McCaleb to a wall. There, written in blood:
McCaleb, Catch me if you can.

903 472 568.

Arrango winks at his partner, then, to McCaleb:
ARRANGO
Another love note. The two of you
should get a room some place.
As McCaleb stares grimly...

EXT. CRIME SCENE (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT

McCaleb exits. The crowd has doubled. A NEWS CREW
bursts past the barricade. Police rush to block them,
but to no avail. They nearly ring McCaleb.
REPORTERS
Was another message left for you,
Agent McCaleb!? -- Why do you
think the killer has picked
you?! -- What do the numbers
mean?!
McCaleb scans the sea of humanity before him. Not
exactly its best face. With a sigh, McCaleb starts to
make his way through, then stops short. Ahead:

FACE IN CROWD
Seen for an instant. Wearing a hooded sweatshirt and
low-billed cap. Staring at McCaleb, an odd look in his
eye.

BACK TO SCENE

A beat before McCaleb looks downward. THROUGH a thicket
of legs, we spot his feet. Covering them are bloody
Converse hi-tops. Chuck Taylor. McCaleb looks over, but
the cops seem suddenly so far away. Hi-Top begins to
drift back.
McCALEB
(toward cops)
Hey... Hey! Over here!
Hi-Top turns and goes, suddenly swallowed up by the
crowd.
McCALEB
(to no avail)
He’s over here!
No one listens. The Reporters continue to fire
questions. Hi-Top is getting away. McCaleb fights his
way through, charges down the street after him.

STREET

Running now, his face unclear as high-top looks back over
his shoulder, sees that McCaleb is chasing him.

NARROW ALLEY
Hi-Top cuts down.

McCaleb closes.

At the end of the alley, an eight feet redwood fence.
Hi-Top jumps, catches hold. As he pulls himself up,
McCaleb hits the fence right behind him.
The fence collapses. The two men sprawl to the ground.
Hi-Top gets up, scoots away. McCaleb rolls to his feet;
the chase is back on.

BACK YARDS

One after the next. Fences are scaled, kicked through.
And McCaleb closes. All we hear are the FOOTFALLS, the
RAGGED BREATHS of the two men.
Then... a HEARTBEAT.
McCaleb reaches for Hi-Top’s shoulder, inches away now.
A chain link fence looms ahead. Hi-Top leaps onto it,
catches hold. As he pulls himself up, McCaleb is right
behind. He catches hold of one of Hi-Top’s legs.

Hi-Top grips the top of the fence, rears back with his
free leg and kicks McCaleb in the face. McCaleb drops.
Hi-Top is up and over, dropping to the other side.
alley behind some businesses.

An

McCaleb gets to his feet, one of Hi-Top’s bloody sneakers
in his hands. He starts to climb the fence.
The HEARTBEAT INTENSIFIES. McCaleb pauses at the top of
the fence, slides back down the way he came. He clutches
at his left arm, a look of surprise on his face.
The heartbeat eclipses all else. McCaleb is having a
heart attack. He grips the fence to keep from falling.

CHAIN LINK

Suddenly, through the pain, McCaleb is aware of a form in
the gloom. We don’t see his face, but, fascinated,
Hi-Top has come back to watch.
McCaleb reaches into his jacket, seemingly for his chest.
But when his hand comes back out, he’s holding his .38
service revolver. Blinking against near blinding pain,
he aims through the fence.
Hi-Top runs for the dark as ROUND AFTER ROUND EXPLODES.
The fourth sends him sprawling. The fifth and sixth sail
wide as Hi-Top stands and staggers into blackness.

McCALEB

Suddenly illuminated by a spotlight. The revolver slips
from his hand as the pain overwhelms him. Bleached
white, he falls back into the dirt, his eyes wide.
As he stares up at a silent, hovering LAPD helicopter, he
mouths words we cannot understand. And as the HEARTBEAT
BECOMES an ELECTRONIC BLIP...
DISSOLVE TO:

A grainy silver and black image of a heart: undulating
and ghostly. The snaking line of a scope moves toward
it.

Almost there.

INT. CEDARS-SINAI HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
On a gurney, his oddly-angled head in a brace, McCaleb
closes his eyes as the line enters his heart.
The voice belongs to DR. BONNIE FOX, the cardiologist who
guides the line through an incision in McCaleb’s neck.
DR. FOX
Coming out, Terry. You did good.
Removing the scope, she tapes a gauze compress to his
neck. As she unstraps the brace, McCaleb rubs his neck.
He looks less than formidable in his hospital johnny.
DR. FOX
Been taking your pills every day?
McCALEB
All thirty-four of them.
DR. FOX
No fever at all?
McCALEB
No, I’m clean.
DR. FOX
And no diarrhea?
McCALEB
I’m clean of that, too.
Good.

DR. FOX
Blood pressure and pulse?

McCALEB
Right on target.
DR. FOX
And the boat? You’re not working
too hard on it?
McCALEB
I’m keeping it afloat.

A young boy is on the bed, his body tied by tubes to a

McCaleb looks away.

McCaleb reads it in his hospital room. He looks up as
Dr. Fox comes through the door, holding a lab report.
DR. FOX
Don’t start running laps yet, but
I’m very pleased. No rejection,
all the levels look good. I might
lower your Prednisone in another
week.
McCALEB
Good. I’m tired of shaving three
times a day.
Dr. Fox smiles, warms a stethoscope with her breath.
DR. FOX
Lean forward please.
He leans forward. She pulls down his johnny, listens to
his heart through his back.
McCALEB
Can I ask you something?
DR. FOX
Don’t talk.
(a beat)
Sit up.
She listens through his chest. For the first time we see
it, the thirteen-inch white scar running over his heart
like a rope. McCaleb half-grimaces at nothing in
particular. Finally, she’s done.
Good.

How long has he been waiting?
DR. FOX
About half as long as you did.
McCALEB
What are his chances?
DR. FOX
Maybe fifty-fifty. Maybe less.
What’s bothering you, Terry?
McCALEB
(after a beat)
When I was with the bureau we had

Dr. Fox smiles sympathetically.

DR. FOX
Typical. You hang around almost
two years waiting for a heart,
draw your string out and nearly
don’t make it and now you wonder
if we should’ve given it to you.
You know what that is?
McCALEB
Bullshit?
DR. FOX
Exactly. Go home and enjoy your
boat. I’ll see you next week.

It’s two in the afternoon, Buddy.
Whatever.

BUDDY
Hey, heads up, man.
McCALEB

What?
BUDDY
(gesturing)
Somebody’s on your boat.
Two boats down. The Following Sea. A woman stands by
the sliding door leading to the boat’s salon. McCaleb
frowns.
BUDDY
Been here ten minutes. Looked
harmless, I didn’t say anything.
McCALEB
(starts forward)
Thanks, Buddy.

THE FOLLOWING SEA

The woman -- GRACIELLA RIVERS -- stares out across the
water. She doesn’t see McCaleb till he’s stepping down
aboard.
McCALEB
Can I help you?
She turns, a little startled.
GRACIELLA
I’m looking for Terrel McCaleb.
McCALEB
You found him.

GRACIELLA
I read about you in the paper, Mr.
McCaleb. ’The Where Are They
Now?’ column. You know, in the
Metro section?
McCALEB
Look, before you start your story,
I have to tell you, you’re not the
first person to come out here and
find me.
(off no answer;
she looks sad)
I can recommend a good, private
investigator. Someone who’ll work
hard and won’t rip you off.
GRACIELLA
The article said you were good.
It said you hated it whenever
somebody got away.
McCALEB
If you read the article, then you
also know what happened to me.
I’m retired, Miss Rivers.
GRACIELLA
Graciella. I think you could help
me. Maybe help yourself, too.
McCALEB
I don’t need the money.
GRACIELLA
I’m not talking about money.

Something weird about how she said it. Graciella reaches
into her purse, hands McCaleb a photo: a smiling woman
watching a boy blow out seven candles on a birthday cake.
The woman looks quite a bit like Graciella.
He looks at it, looks back at her.
McCALEB
Your sister?
Yes.

GRACIELLA
And her son.
McCALEB

Which one?

GRACIELLA
Excuse me?
McCALEB
Which one is dead?
GRACIELLA
My sister. Gloria Torres.
Her son’s name is Raymond.

Glory.

McCaleb holds the photo out, sighs.
McCALEB
Look, Miss Rivers, I just can’t do
this. I’m sorry.
She makes no move to take the photo.
GRACIELLA
Look at it again. Please. Just
one more time and then I’ll leave
you alone. Tell me if you feel
anything?
McCALEB
(irritated)
I was an F.B.I. agent, not a
psychic. Now do you want this
photo back or not?
GRACIELLA
I have a double. You know, two
for the price of one. You’ll want
to keep that one.
McCALEB
Why would I want to do that?
Graciella reaches out her hand. Past the photo McCaleb
still holds out. She places the palm of her hand on his
chest, runs it slowly down the front of his shirt, her
fingers tracing the scar beneath.
GRACIELLA
Your heart. It was my sister’s.
(a beat)
My phone number’s on the back if
you change your mind.
With that, Graciella steps up to the dock and starts
away. Speechless, McCaleb watches her go, then turns
over the photo. A number is scrawled on back.
CUT TO:

GLASS THERMOMETER

The mercury rises, stops at 98.6 degrees.

INT. THE FOLLOWING SEA - FORWARD HEAD - NIGHT

McCaleb takes the thermometer out of his mouth, reads it.
He picks up a clipboard with a temperature chart. In a
column he adds another in a series of dashes. No change.
Looking at the mirror, he studies his eyes, then pulls
off his shirt. Time to look at the scar. It’s a ritual.
CUT TO:

INT. THE FOLLOWING SEA - SALON - NIGHT

McCaleb sits at the desk, turns on a light. Hanging from
the light, a Lucite block which holds his FBI badge.
Tacked on the corkboard beyond that, a laminated
newspaper line-up of code killer victims. Under them:
903 472 568. McCaleb frowns at it and turns away.
CUT TO:

INT. THE FOLLOWING SEA - CABIN - NIGHT

McCaleb lies in his bunk staring up at the ceiling.
Unable to sleep. Finally, he retrieves his watch from a
slot on the wall. The glow-in-the-dark hands read 3:29
AM.

EXT. DOCK - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

A full moon shines down on the all but deserted sight.
McCaleb dials the number on the back of the photo.
McCALEB
Miss Rivers, it’s Terry McCaleb.
I know it’s late, but -(a beat)
I’m going to go see the police
tomorrow and ask about this.
(another beat)
Don’t thank me. I don’t want you
to get your hopes up. I’m just
going to take a look. I owe your
sister that much. Now...
He takes a note pad and pencil from his pocket.

McCALEB
Before I start, I’ll need some
information.
CUT TO:

The young detective punches three digits into a phone,

INT. HOMICIDE BULLPEN - DAY

McCaleb has only gone a few steps when a solidly built
man in a white shirt and tie steps in front of him. Gun
in a shoulder harness. Detective Arrango from a few
years ago.
ARRANGO
Mr. McCaleb.
McCALEB
Detective Arrango.

McCaleb makes a point of shaking his hand.
ARRANGO
I thought you had died, or at
least retired. My guy up front
said you’re here about Glory
Torres.
McCALEB
That’s right. Is there a place
where we can talk?
ARRANGO
Talk about what?
McCALEB
I’m looking into her death.
ARRANGO
Oh shit, here we go.
Irritated, Arrango turns, snaps his fingers to get the
attention of his partner Walters who’s on the phone. As
Walters motions he’ll be a minute...
ARRANGO
You got five minutes before I toss
you outta here.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Arrango leads the way in, closes the door behind McCaleb.
ARRANGO
Have a seat. My partner will be
here in a minute.
McCALEB
(sitting down)
Want a doughnut?
ARRANGO
(also sitting)
Keep your doughnuts. It’s the
sister, isn’t it? You’re working
for the goddamn sister. Let me
see your ticket.
McCALEB
I don’t have a license, if that’s
what you mean.
Arrango glares at him a beat.

ARRANGO
Jesus, it’s stuffy in here.

Arrango gets up, adjusts a thermostat on the wall and
goes back for his seat. As he does, McCaleb glances up
at an air duct grill over the door.
ARRANGO
You say you’re conducting an
investigation into the Gloria
Torres homicide, is that correct?
McCALEB
(sighs)
Yes, that’s right.
ARRANGO
And you have no license in the
state of California to operate as
a private investigator, true?
McCALEB
True.
Walters enters. Without looking, Arrango signals him not
to interrupt. Walters leans against the wall.
ARRANGO
Do you understand, Mr. McCaleb,
that it is a crime in this state
to operate as a private
investigator without a license?
McCALEB
Can we skip the bullshit and turn
off the tape and camera and just
talk a minute? Besides, Walters
is leaning against the microphone.
You’re not picking anything up.
Arrango turns as Walters jumps away from the wall.
WALTERS
Why didn’t you tell me?
ARRANGO
Shuddup!
McCALEB
Have a doughnut, guys.

ARRANGO
How do you know Graciella Rivers?

McCALEB
She’s an acquaintance.
me to look into this.

She asked

McCaleb opens the box of doughnuts.
Arrango, whose face is stone.

Walters looks to

McCALEB
Well, I’m going to have one.
McCaleb takes out a cinnamon. After a beat, Walters
grabs a glazed. Finally, against his better judgment,
Arrango takes a powdered. They each chew a moment.
ARRANGO
I don’t know what the sister told
you, Mr. Former-F.B.I.-profiler,
but this isn’t Charlie Manson or
Ted fucking Bundy. It’s a
convenience store robbery. Some
mope with a mask and a gun and the
right ratio of balls to brains.
That’s all.
McCALEB
I know, but I told her I’d check
it out. It’s been two months. I
thought maybe you guys wouldn’t
mind a fresh set of eyes.
Walters looks at Arrango, shrugs a why not.
McCALEB
I’m not here to show you up.
Anything I come up with, you’ll be
the first to know.
ARRANGO
What do you want?
McCALEB
Copy me the murder book and the
video walk-through on the crime
scene. I was always good with
crime scenes.
Walters and Arrango exchange another look.

Then...

ARRANGO
I don’t think so, man.
McCALEB
Let me ask you something, does the
sister call you much?

ARRANGO
All the time. Week in and week
out I tell her the same thing. No
suspects, no leads.
McCALEB
This could get her off your case.
If I see what you got and say you
boys did your best, she might back
off.
Arrango smiles at the thought of that.
ARRANGO
You say you were good with crime
scenes?
McCALEB
Yeah, if you made a tape...
Arrango winks at Walters, then looks back at McCaleb.
ARRANGO
We got better than a crime scene
tape. We got the crime.
(stands)
Come on. Bring those doughnuts
with you.

INT. LIEUTENANT’S OFFICE - TELEVISION SCREEN - DAY
The screen flickers on. A black and white surveillance
camera view of the counter of a convenience store. A
date and time line runs across the bottom of the screen.
The frame is empty a few seconds until the counterman
leans in over the register. He breaks open a roll of
quarters.
WALTERS
That’s Kyungwon Kang, the owner.
ARRANGO
He’s spending his last few seconds
on the planet here.
As he closes the register, a woman steps up. Easily
recognizable from the photo -- Gloria Torres. Glory.
She smiles as she sets a Hershey bar down on the counter.
ARRANGO
Came in to buy a fucking candy
bar. You believe that?

McCALEB
(softly)
For her son...

As Gloria hands a dollar bill over, a man in a black ski
mask and black jumpsuit moves up behind Gloria.
She’s still smiling as ski mask puts his right hand on
her right shoulder and in one continuous move brings the
muzzle of a handgun up to her left temple.
Without hesitation, he pulls the trigger.
ARRANGO
Badda-bing!
McCaleb grimaces as bloody mist jettisons from the wound.
Ski mask holds her up as a shield, then raises his left
hand to FIRE a ROUND into Mr. Kang. Kang vainly grapples
for a hold on the counter like a man going over a cliff.
Ski mask lowers Gloria’s body to the floor.
drops out of sight.

Her head

Ski mask steps up as Mr. Kang pulls a revolver from under
some papers bags. Ski mask shoots him in the face.
Ski mask scoops the cash from the register, then picks up
something off Mr. Kang’s arm. He then reaches for
something on the floor.
WALTERS
He picked up all the shells.
Ski mask looks directly at the camera and says something.
McCALEB
No sound on the camera, right?
WALTERS
Right. Whatever he said there, he
said to himself.
Ski mask then makes one last pass on his way out.
ARRANGO
You ain’t gonna see that on
’America’s Favorite Home Videos.’
McCALEB
(ignoring comment)
Can I see it again? Slowed down?

ARRANGO
It’s not over yet.
McCALEB
What?
ARRANGO
The good Samaritan comes in now.
On screen, a dark-haired, dark-complected man in jeans
and a T-shirt enters. He hesitates, looks down at
Gloria, then over the counter at Mr. Kang. He kneels
over Gloria’s body. Almost immediately, he’s up and
away.
ARRANGO
He went down the aisles looking
for bandages. He actually wrapped
her head with tape and paper
towels.
The good Samaritan is back doing just that.
ARRANGO
Camera never got a good look at
him. After he finished, he went
outside, called 9-1-1 and split.
WALTERS
Voice on the tape was Latino.

Afraid to stick around.

McCALEB
Too bad. He was there so soon, he
probably saw the shooter’s car,
maybe the shooter.
WALTERS
We put out flyers, went on Channel
34. Nothing.
(re:

McCALEB
TV)

May I?
Arrango shrugs, annoyed.
McCaleb rewinds, starts the tape again. This time in
slow motion. As the gun gets pressed up against Gloria
Torres’ head, he freezes it. The smile has only halfleft her.

Arrango smirks as McCaleb scribbles the time:
McCaleb hesitates before resuming play.

22:41:39.

ARRANGO
Pause button’s not gonna help her
now.
McCaleb hits it. Gloria dies. The tape plays through
ski mask saying something into the camera.
McCALEB
He winked.
WALTERS
What?
McCaleb rewinds, plays it slower.

As ski mask says his

McCaleb freezes it again as the good Samaritan walks in.
He notes the new time line: 22:42:55. As the tape
finishes, McCaleb is visibly affected.
ARRANGO
Okay, Mr. F.B.I. man, tell us
something we don’t know.
McCaleb stares over at Arrango, hardens up.
McCALEB
The shooter’s been in the store
before. He knew where the camera
was. So he’s either from the
neighborhood or he cased the
place. Plus this wasn’t the first
time. No hesitation, no panic, he
picks up the brass. This guy’s
done it before.
Arrango and Walters exchange a look. Walters starts to
say something, but Arrango holds up a hand to silence
him.
McCALEB
What?
Neither man answers.
McCALEB
How many others?
Neither man answers again.

McCALEB
Can I see the murder book?
ARRANGO
Let us talk to the lieutenant and
we’ll get back to you.
Arrango and Walters both stand.

Meeting over.

McCALEB
When?
ARRANGO
Give me a number. We’ll be in
touch.
That’s all he’s getting. Taking out a pen, McCaleb
writes a number on the top of the doughnut box. He
shoves it in Arrango’s hands, gives Walters a nasty look,
then starts out with Arrango calling after him.
ARRANGO
Hey, we don’t need your shit,
McCaleb, we got a whole plateful
of our own!
CUT TO:

EXT. SHERMAN MARKET (CANOGA PARK) - DAY

A cab pulls up and as McCaleb gets out...
McCALEB
Wait here.
McCaleb studies the storefront a beat. There’s a pay
phone right out front. A deep breath and he starts in.

INT. SHERMAN MARKET - DAY

McCaleb enters, smiling over at the elderly ASIAN WOMAN
behind the counter. The counter where Mr. Kang died.
She doesn’t smile back.
McCaleb goes to the display racks full of candy and picks
out a Hershey bar. He steps to the counter, sets it
down.
As the Asian Woman RINGS it up, McCaleb looks up at the
surveillance camera. He then hands the woman a dollar.

McCALEB
Are you Mrs. Kang?
Yes.

ASIAN WOMAN
I know you?

McCALEB
No, it’s just... I heard what
happened here. To your husband.
I’m sorry.
ASIAN WOMAN
Yes, thank you.
(a beat)
The only way to keep evil out is
to not unlock door. We can’t do
that. We must have business.
McCaleb nods that he understands. As she hands him his
change, he looks one more time at the surveillance
camera, then once behind him. Playing the crime over in
his head.
As he exits, he nods to Mrs. Kang.
McCALEB
Thank you.

EXT. SHERMAN MARKET - DAY

McCaleb steps to the pay phone. This is where the Good
Samaritan stood. McCaleb reaches out, pretends to dial
9-1-1. A beat, then he scans the street.

McCALEB’S POV - STREET

A wide, busy four-lane boulevard. Across the street -- a
strip mall parking lot. A man sitting in a car. He
lifts a newspaper almost the instant McCaleb notices him.

McCALEB

Not alarmed.

In fact, he’s about to dismiss it, when...

CABBIE
Hey! You gonna pay me or should I
drive you somewhere else?
McCaleb strides over to the cab, gets in.

McCALEB
The nearest public library.

The Cabbie thinks a beat, then starts to pull away.
McCaleb looks across the street. The car is gone.
CUT TO:

INT. LIBRARY - COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

McCaleb is in the research section. On screen, he calls
up the L.A. Times, accesses the search function. When it
asks for key words, McCaleb types: "robbery, ski mask,
shooting."
He hits enter and waits. As the computer works, McCaleb
dumps a handful of pills into the palm of his hand. As
he chases them down with a bottle of water, the computer
flashes a new screen.
Two matches to the key words.

McCaleb hits "print."
CUT TO:

EXT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT (WHITTIER) - DAY

The cab pulls up again.

INT. DETECTIVE WINSTON’S OFFICE (HOMICIDE) - DAY
The door opens.

A DEPUTY shows McCaleb in.

DEPUTY
Detective Winston said to wait
here. She’ll be right with you.
The Deputy leaves McCaleb alone.
McCaleb steps over to a wall of citations and a
smattering of press clippings. One is from a police
magazine:
It shows both McCaleb and Det. Jaye Winston receiving
citations for an arrest of "The Cemetery Man."
The door opens and JAYE enters, looks happy to see him.
JAYE
How’s it going, Terry?
you got a new ticker.

I heard

McCALEB
(as they shake hands)
Yeah, and I’m doing okay. You?
JAYE
Same old same old. What’s up?
You on a private ticket now?
McCALEB
No, just doing a favor for a
friend.
JAYE
What case is it?

McCaleb pulls the LA Times library printouts from his
bag.
McCALEB
James Cordell. A.T.M. holdup on
January twenty-two. Newspaper
says he was shot by a guy wearing
a ski mask.

Same guy, Terry. Out of your

You know, guys with two felony
convictions. A third puts them
away for life.

Shooter’s back there, but I’m

Otherwise Cordell would’ve run.

He said something in the Valley

JAYE
James Lockridge. He pulled into
the bank parking lot. Almost got
sideswiped by a sedan roaring out.
Said it was a white guy, but
couldn’t give us anything else.
He called for an ambulance.
Cordell died on the way to the
hospital.
McCALEB
You got any leads at all?
JAYE
Been following the three-strikes
thing. Looking up local stick-up
men with two or more falls under
their belts. I think the man in
the ski mask is one of them. Used
to be a robber, now he’s a robbing
murderer.
McCALEB
What about the gun? Heckler and
Koch. Expensive for a holdup man
and weird that he’d hang onto it
after the first killing.

JAYE
I figured he stole it, but that
didn’t lead anywhere. I hate to
say it, McCaleb, but I think we’re
going to need fresh blood to solve
this one.
McCALEB
Can you copy the murder books,
Jaye? Yours and L.A.’s?
JAYE
I’ll ask the captain, but I don’t
see why not. He was the

Thanks for seeing me.
Lockridge looks from the hand to McCaleb.

Good.

LOCKRIDGE
Police are stupid.

McCALEB
Why do you say that?
LOCKRIDGE
Didn’t they tell you?
McCaleb looks at him, shrugs.

LOCKRIDGE
Why would they? When I found the
guy shot, I called 9-1-1. They
got the address transposed and
they sent the ambulance to the
wrong place. It took twenty
minutes. Guy was breathing the
whole time. He might’ve made it
if they hadn’t fucked up.
McCALEB
These things happen, I guess.
LOCKRIDGE
No. They fucked up and the guy
died. I’m real busy. I agreed to
see you because you were already
here. What do you want?
McCALEB
I read your statement, but I’d
like to hear from you what
happened.
LOCKRIDGE
I needed cash. As I pulled into
the lot, a guy driving out almost
hit me. It was dark. All I saw
was it was a car. No plates, no
face, nothing. I walk up to the
A.T.M. and there’s a guy bleeding.
He must’ve got it right before I
got there. I call 9-1-1 and ten
minutes later, they went driving
past us. Past us.

McCALEB
Did you notice anything at all,

LOCKRIDGE
Yeah. That it could’ve been me.
It could’ve been him finding me.

McCaleb wheels to face a longhaired MAN wearing Wayfarer

Pinning McCaleb’s neck with a knee, he goes through his

Gloria. It looks like the same
gunman.
GRACIELLA
So why would Gloria know him?
They were both just in the wrong
place at the wrong time, right?

It’s a hunch, but this
investigation was run under the
theory that the locations were
chosen and the victims were
random. I think it might be the
other way around.

To check it out I need to see if
your sister and Cordell had
anything in common. Some
intersection that hooks them to
each other or to the gunman.

on it. Grainy, but you can see: the crucifix earring.
PLAY. Gloria is shot. Kang is shot. As the shooter
lowers Gloria’s upper torso out of frame, McCaleb goes to
jog mode. The shooter rises back into frame.
McCaleb jogs back and forth over the shooter’s hand as it
slides in and out of his pocket. He’s taken the earring!

McCaleb steps out to the deck of The Following Sea.
McCALEB
Hey, Buddy!
A few beats before a bleary Buddy staggers up on deck.
BUDDY
What’s up, Terry?
McCALEB
You’re working tomorrow.

Six AM.

Cool.
As Buddy turns, he kicks into part of the pile of

Is that your partner in the car?
McCALEB
Uh, my driver.
MRS. CORDELL
Oh. I thought of hiring a private
investigator, but I just couldn’t
afford to.

She looks at the two little bikes leaned against the
wall.
MRS. CORDELL
Couldn’t afford to find out who
killed my husband.
(looks up)
Do you work for the police?
McCALEB
I’m a retired F.B.I. agent. A
friend of the family of a woman
who was killed in Canoga Park. We
think it was the same gunman in
both cases.
MRS. CORDELL
I see.
McCALEB
First of all, I’m sorry. I know
it doesn’t matter what a stranger
thinks, but you have my sympathy.
From what I read in the file,
James was a good man.
MRS. CORDELL
(smiles)
It’s funny to hear him called
James. Everyone called him Jimmy.
And he was a very good man. How
can I help, Mr. McCaleb?
McCaleb takes out a photo and hands it to her. It’s the
shot of Gloria Torres and Raymond that Graciella gave
him.
McCALEB
Do you recognize this woman?
Mrs. Cordell studies it.
McCALEB
Does she look like someone your
husband could’ve known?
MRS. CORDELL
No, I don’t think so. Was she the
victim in Canoga Park?
McCALEB
Yes.

MRS. CORDELL
Is that her son?
Yes.

McCALEB
That’s Raymond.

MRS. CORDELL
I don’t understand. How could my
husband have known her? Are you
suggesting they may have -McCALEB
No, Mrs. Cordell, nothing like
that.
MRS. CORDELL
Then like what?
McCALEB
Somewhere your husband and Miss
Torres may have crossed the
shooter’s path. The relationship
is between the victims and the
shooter. I need to know if your
husband and Miss Torres had
anything in common. It may seem
like nothing. They both ate at
the same restaurant for example.
MRS. CORDELL
(figuring along)
A restaurant the killer went to.
McCALEB
Yes, that’s right.
MRS. CORDELL
That sounds like stalking, not
robbery.
McCALEB
To be honest, robbery may not have
been the motive here.
She hands him back the photo.
McCALEB
Was anything missing when they
turned over your husband’s
personal effects? His wristwatch?
Wedding ring?
MRS. CORDELL
No.

McCALEB
Would he have been in Canoga Park,
the West Valley in the weeks
before the shooting?
MRS. CORDELL
No. As a matter of fact he’d just
spent a month up in Northern
California working on the aqueduct
up there. He went into Los
Angeles maybe twice a year. When
my husband wasn’t working, Mr.
McCaleb, he was home. With me.
About the most exotic thing he did
was give blood every few months or
so.
McCaleb nods, sorry for what he’s already put her
through. A silent beat.
He looks over toward the garage. There’s a Chevy
Suburban, boxes piled behind it like no one ever drives
it.
McCALEB
Was that your husband’s car?
MRS. CORDELL
Yes.
McCALEB
Did he keep anything personal
inside it?
MRS. CORDELL
A picture of the kids on the
dashboard.
McCALEB
And that’s still there?
MRS. CORDELL
I don’t know. I would think, but
someone from the sheriff’s
department drove it home. I
haven’t been in it since.

Mrs. Cordell opens the door to the Suburban. McCaleb
looks over her shoulder. There on the dash, a photo of
two little girls.

MRS. CORDELL
There it is.

McCaleb can’t quite hide his disappointment.

Still...

McCALEB
Did he have a favorite knickknack, a coffee mug, anything?
No.

MRS. CORDELL
I’m sorry.

McCALEB
That’s fine, Mrs. Cordell. What
would help is in the next few days
if you could write down any
routines your husband had or -Wait a minute.

MRS. CORDELL

MRS. CORDELL

Wayfarers.

He had them for years.

These people were stalked and
killed where the shooter knew
there’d be a camera. Personal

ARRANGO
What the fuck are you talking
about?
McCALEB
I was at the A.T.M. crime scene
yesterday. I didn’t realize it at
the time, but the shooter was in
line behind me. He was wearing
James Cordell’s sunglasses and
Gloria Torres’ earring.
Walters and Arrango exchange a look. Arrango reaches
into his pocket for two more evidence bags. One holds
sunglasses, the other a crucifix earring.
ARRANGO
Found the stuff in his left hand.
I don’t care what we call him; we
got him.
McCALEB

something between his teeth.
The detectives turn as the tweezers fish out:
FORENSICS #1
It’s a bullet.
Indeed, a partially flattened slug.
FORENSICS #2
That looks like a .38 to me.
As Forensics One nods in agreement...
JAYE
Why would he put a .38 slug in his
mouth?
McCALEB
Same reason he died on the

can’t.
Arrango steps forward, gets in his face.
ARRANGO

On the you, Arrango pokes McCaleb in the chest. McCaleb
grabs Arrango’s hand, bends the thumb to a pressure
point.
McCALEB
You know Gloria Torres? The
victim you don’t give a shit
about? I got her heart. I’m
alive because she’s dead.
As Arrango hunches in pain, McCaleb speaks into his ear.
McCALEB
That cuts me into this in a big
way. So I don’t care about your
feelings. You’re an asshole and
that’s fine, but I’m not backing
out till we get this guy.
McCaleb lets go of Arrango, stiff-arms him back.
