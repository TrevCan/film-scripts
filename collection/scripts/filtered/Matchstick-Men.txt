SHOOTING DRAFT
October 14, 2002

FADE IN:

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

An immaculate pool -- clean, clear and placid -- crowds
the back yard, bouncing light against the house.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - AT WINDOW - DAY

The pool can be seen THROUGH filigreed metallic blinds.
ROY ENTERS FRAME, suited, coffee cup in hand, and peers
out at it for a spell. A calming moment to start his
day. Then:
He raises the blinds, wincing at the floor of sunlight.
He checks the window's lock, re-locks it for good
measure, then closes the shade again.
AT NEXT WINDOW
The ritual repeated:
locks it.

blinds up, window's locked, he re-

AT THIRD
Repeated.

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - MORNING
Three doors line the left wall; one divides the right;
all are shut. Roy emerges from the nearest door on the
left (a bedroom) and shuts it behind him. He crosses to
the single door on the right (a bathroom), opens it,
enters, and shuts it behind him. WATER RUNS and a TOILET
FLUSHES.
He reappears, shuts the door behind him, and enters the
middle door on the left (another bedroom, unoccupied).
He re-emerges with a handkerchief in hand, then in
pocket, and a beeper on his belt, and again shuts the
door behind him.
He starts for the far door (to a living room) but manages
only a few steps before he stops, turns, and heads back
to the bathroom door. He opens it and peers inside. A
three-count and he shuts it again.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - DAY

Roy rinses out his mug of coffee, washes the sink basin
clean of it, wipes down the kitchen countertop, already
spotless, and lets the faucet run as --- he takes from a cupboard an unlabeled vial of pills.
Pulls off the cap, taps two capsules into his palm. And
just stares at it. Anxious and exhausted.
Then: He tosses the pills down his throat, chases them
with tap water, and gives the faucet a firm tug off.

INT. ROY'S CHEVY CAPRICE - DAY

Window cracked just enough to suck out his cigarette
smoke. AM-FM forecasts the natural weather, region-byregion.
RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
Elsewhere, temperatures in New
York in the high 80's, Chicago
reports rain, temperatures in the
high 70's...

EXT. STOPLIGHT - DAY

Roy slows to a halt behind a mini-van full of kids. They
laugh and scream and wave at Roy. His hands stay glued
at 2 and 10.
FRANK (V.O.)
No, ma'am, it's confirmed -7

INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY

FRANK MERCER, younger than Roy, works the phones. A sea
of papers floods his desk, while the adjoining desk
(Roy's) is pristine. In lieu of decor there are stacks
of cardboard boxes piled everywhere.
FRANK
-- the Chevy Blazer, the Paris
vacation, or the Tiffany necklace.
It's okay if you don't remember
entering the contest, ma'am,
you've won -The next call -(CONTINUED)

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

FRANK
-- do you have a water filtration
system in your house? Do you read
the papers or watch TV, sir? Then
you've probably seen our
advertisements --

The next call -FRANK
-- we just have to wait for the
sponsor's rep to fly in for the
final drawing. That should be
next week sometime -8

INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY

At his window, Frank watches Roy, frozen in his car.
FRANK
-- if you buy the Waterford II
water filtration system, the prize
gets recorded as a sales expense
and you don't pay any tax. Good
deal, huh?
Frank turns to one of the boxes marked "Waterford II" and
peels off a price sticker: $49.99.
FRANK
$398.00 even. You'd pay twice
that in stores.

SAME - MINUTES LATER

Roy enters, shuts the door behind him.

FRANK
You want to what? When will he be
home?
(beat)
Mrs. Fisk, my supervisor just
stepped into my office and he
would love to talk to you. Can
you hold just a sec?
(puts her on hold;
to Roy, overly sunny)
Good morning. Something on the
radio?
(he offers phone)
Irene Fisk. 'Wants to talk to her
husband first.'
Who doesn't?

ROY
Roy declines Frank's phone, moves to his own. He plucks
up the receiver, cleans its mouthpiece with his
handkerchief, then un-holds Mrs. Fisk. The moment he
does, his whole personality transforms.
ROY
Mrs. Fisk? John Goodhew, regional
vice-president at Allied
Affiliates. Congratulations!
Which prize are you hoping for?
(beat)
That would be my choice, too. Can
I ask you one question, Irene? Do
you have grandchildren?
(beat)
Five! How old? Well, you're a
very lucky woman. Yes, I agree:
they are our most precious
resource. I've got a six and twoyear old at home and I'll tell
you: the day I installed a
filtrator... Absolutely you can
taste the difference. Now I
understand you'd like to talk to
your husband about this first, and
I understand why, but the thing
is, Irene -(confidentially)
-- my secretary is having a baby
this afternoon and the whole
office here is about to bug out
and go over to the hospital. Yes,
it's very exciting. But today is
our deadline, so you see...

Listening, Roy nods to Frank: she's in. Frank goes to
work -- calling a courier service on Roy's line (his
mouth grazing the receiver, Roy notices) -- as Roy
finishes up. And though his voice may be grinning, his
eyes betray him: he doesn't enjoy this.
ROY
Irene, that's sweet of you to
offer, and I'm sure she'd love
that, but we're in Chicago. Uhhuh, cooped up in our corporate
offices on State Street. I'll
tell you, though, I rather be out
in sunny California with you today
'cause it's just pouring up here.
Cats and dogs, exactly. Now let
me confirm your address for our
courier service...

INT. ROY'S CAPRICE (OFFICE PARKING LOT) - DAY
Roy behind the wheel; Frank knots his tie.
tight.

Windows up

FRANK
You got any thoughts on lunch?
Roy nods. A long-standing joke: the non-answer answer.
Frank angles his foot up on the dash, and Roy points it
off.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Roy moves briskly ahead of Frank along a sidewalk, his
hands thrust deep in his coat pockets, which he does
whenever he's outside.

EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS HOME
Door answered by a MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE. Roy and Frank
stand on her front porch. Roy presents identification.
ROY
Carolyn Schaffer?
(as she nods)
I'm Agent Kellaway, this is Agent
Cole, we're from the Federal Trade
Commission. Sorry to disturb you.
We'd like to ask you a few
questions if we could.

HOUSEWIFE
Is everything alright?
ROY
We hope so, ma'am.
in?

May we come

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Roy and Frank sit at a breakfast table, across from the
Housewife and her HUSBAND. The Housewife gives her
testimony:
HOUSEWIFE
He said there'd been a contest,
and I'd won a prize. He said
there'd be a drawing in a week,
and I'd either win a trip to, um,
France or Italy, I can't remember.
He said if I bought one of their
products, their filtration things,
I wouldn't have to pay tax of the
prize.
She indicates a Waterford II installed on her kitchen
faucet, then wilts under her husband's stare.
HUSBAND
Jesus, Carolyn...
HOUSEWIFE
(penitent, near tears)
I was going to surprise you...
ROY
I'm sorry to tell you this, ma'am,
but you won't be receiving any
prize. And I'm sorry to tell you
you've been the victim of fraud.

Otis!

HUSBAND
(pissed, taking it out
on family dog who
scratches at door)
Knock it off!

FRANK
It's not the newest swindle in the
world, just new to some. They
bait you with something bogus,
then sell you something worthless.

ROY
How much did you give them, Mrs.
Schaffer?
HOUSEWIFE
Seven hundred dollars.
HUSBAND
Ah, Jesus, Carolyn...
(to Frank and Roy)
What's it worth?
FRANK
Any hardware store they're about
fifty bucks -ROY
But we've met people who paid
twice what you did.
(to Housewife)
You wrote a check, ma'am?
(as she nods)
Did you mail it to them?
HOUSEWIFE
A courier picked it up.

Roy and Frank exchange grimaces.
What?

HUSBAND
ROY
If they use the postal system,
it's mail fraud and we can go
after them. Otherwise, there's
not a lot we can do.
Unless...
Unless what?

FRANK
HUSBAND
ROY
A lot of these sons-of-bitches -excuse me, ma'am -- they work in
syndicates. If they cashed your
check out of state, it's federal
and we can act. But we'd need a
signed clearance from you for your
bank to run a trace on the check,
and then -(CONTINUED)

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

HUSBAND
I'll give you a clearance. If
it'll help get those bastards.
ROY
(to Frank)
You have any more of those L-47's?
FRANK
Maybe in the car.
(rises to go, by
chance feels inside
his pocket)
Wait, here we go.
Roy takes the form and lays it before the Husband.
ROY
Here, use my pen.
As the Husband's eyes glaze over the small print, the DOG
SCRATCHES at the door again.
HUSBAND
Let him out, will ya, Carolyn?
The Housewife slides open a glass door for the dog, then
returns to her seat -- without closing it behind her.
Roy's focus fixes on it. And every voice drifts into
the distance.
ROY
All we need is the name of your
bank, your account number and your
signature at the bottom. Any
luck, these guys were amateurs,
cashed your check in Nevada.
HUSBAND
See, darling? I told you: you're
too trusting. You gotta be more
careful of people.
FRANK
I'm sorry to say, ma'am, he's
absolutely right.
HUSBAND
(signing L-47)
Here ya go.
(off Roy's fixed,
uneasy stare)
You alright?

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Frank notices now, too -- Roy is sweating and uneasy,
fixated on the small wilderness outside -- and recognizes
the cause of his infirmity: the open door.
FRANK
Do you mind if I close this?
They don't. Frank rises and closes the glass door. Roy
snaps out of it. Sound within the room returns to normal.
ROY
I'm fine, thanks.
(he takes L-47)
Thank you.
Sorry.

Frank smiles to allay the Husband's suspicions:
fuck was that about?

What the

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Roy and Frank return to their car, Roy speedily.
FRANK
You're not taking your pills, are you?
Roy faces him, testily, but he never pauses in his effort
to get inside his car as fast as he can. Frank,
admonished, takes his time getting in.
FRANK
It's just that... you looked like
you were gonna whoopsy-daisy all
over those people's Oriental.
A breath to compose himself and Roy STARTS the CAR.
FRANK
You are taking your pills?

Yes.

ROY
(at last)
The car pulls out.

EXT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY

The Caprice pulls into the parking lot. Inside, Frank
splits up the day's take, fifty-fifty. Roy seems barely
interested.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

FRANK
Well, it's not a fortune, but it
keeps me in diapers. Barely. One
look at those drapes I should have
known.
(beat)
I saw that guy again last night:
Chuck. The guy I was telling you,
with the -ROY
-- with the boat.
FRANK
(sing-song)
He's top-heavy.
(off no response
from Roy)
It's real money, Roy.
ROY
If it's real money, it's long con.
I don't do long con.
FRANK
You haven't done it lately.

Frank is looking for a glimmer of hope.

Roy gives him none.

ROY
Without me, Frank.
Frank puts up his hands:

never mind.

FRANK
Okay. I'd just like to, you know,
take a girl out somewhere nice
once in a while.
ROY
(beat)
You have to pay her extra for that?

INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT AISLE - DAY
Roy drops a half-dozen cans of Chicken-By-the-Sea on the
conveyor. The CHECK-OUT WOMAN totals them:
CHECK-OUT WOMAN
... four, five, six. And a pack
of Winston's.
For Roy, it's a standing order here.

10A.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

EXT. ROY'S HOME - DAY
A modest one-story.

Roy's Caprice pulls in the driveway.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Roy, shoeless, skirts the living room rug to approach a
ceramic horse in the corner, next to a sofa. He slides
its head up and off its body and rests it on the floor,
then reaches into its hollow belly to withdraw a .38. He
removes from his jacket the day's take and stuffs it
inside the horse. He replaces the weapon atop it.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - AT TABLE - NIGHT
Roy eats dinner:

tuna, straight from the can.

AT SINK
He washes out the empty can, then turns to his shoes,
rinsing and wiping down their soles.

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Predictably Spartan. Roy wears pajamas to bed. He lies
down, head on his pillow, eyes toward the ceiling, wide
and anxious and exhausted and sad, to smoke himself to
sleep.
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The morning ritual again. Roy stares out his window,
coffee cup in hand, at the pool. And his moment of
serenity has been violated for -22

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
Two leaves float atop the pool surface.
long-pole net, removes them.

Roy, with a

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN

Roy throws the leaves away in the trash below the sink,
then rinses out his coffee mug/washes down the
basin/cleans the countertop/lets the faucet run. Finds
his vial of pills and taps two capsules into his palm.
Sets the vial down beside the sink. Stares at the pills
again --- then throws them back in his throat and washes them
down with tap water (filtrated by a Waterford II). He
reaches to turn the faucet off --- and accidentally knocks the uncapped vial into the
sink, upending it and sending pills scattering.
Dammit!

ROY
He grabs for the vial, empty -- pills are swirling down
the drain -- then scrambles for the tap, slamming it off,
but too late: all the capsules have been swept away.

Shit!

ROY
Roy frets, thinks, decides. Rolling up his sleeve, he
dips his hand into the sink's disposal, patting around
its base for pills.
At last, he finds one. Pinches it and raises it into the
light. And Roy knows: there's no way he'll ever put
that thing in his mouth.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Roy's on his portable phone, desperate.
ROY
Hi, I need to talk to Mancuso.
(beat)
Man-cus-o.
(beat)
What do you mean he...?
(beat)
You gotta be shitting me...
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Roy frets, paces. He stops, looks down. He's been
walking on the living room rug -- disaster.

INT. ROY'S CLOSET

Roy yanks out his vacuum cleaner.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM

Roy VACUUMS the rug back-and-forth, back-and-forth, backand-forth. He STOPS. Studies the rug. Then looks up.
Suddenly everything looks dirty.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN

Under the sink, Roy rifles through a gallery of cleaning
products -- Pine Sol, Murphy's Oil Soap, Ajax, Windex.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM
Roy cleans.

Dishwashing gloves on, down on his knees.

INT. ROY'S BATHROOM

Roy cleans behind the toilet. The PHONE RINGS in the
next room. Roy shows no interest in answering it.
FRANK (V.O.over message machine)
Roy, pick up. It's me, pick up,
Roy. Roy, where are you?

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN

Roy takes his lunch break, one dishwashing glove removed,
eating straight from the can again.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE

Roy cleans all the windows, from the inside only -SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK. The PHONE RINGS again.

INT. ROY'S HOUSE - MEDLEY OF PRISTINE ROOMS - LATER

FRANK (V.O.on machine again)
What the hell, Roy. I feel like a
chick. Okay, that's it. I'm
coming over.
ROY (O.S.)
Shit.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM

Roy sits prone on his couch. Eyes bloodshot and weary,
studying the carpet. There is a KNOCK at the front door.
Roy!

FRANK (O.S.)
You in there? Roy!

Roy does not respond.

Frank KNOCKS some more.

FRANK (O.S.)
Roy, goddammit! Your car's here,
I know you're here!
(beat)
I'll call the cops, I'll do it.
I'll put all my shit where they
can't find it, I'll call them and
they'll come down here!
Roy surrenders:

he gets off the couch.

AT HIS FRONT DOOR

Roy unlocks it, opens it, latch on.
mouth appear in the opening.

Frank's nose and

FRANK
(sigh of relief)
Thank Jesus. Open up, lemme in.
ROY
Take off your shoes.
What?

Why?

FRANK
ROY
Take 'em off, or you don't come
in.
FRANK
(looking in at him)
You didn't take your pills, did
you?
Roy shuts the door, walks away.
FRANK (O.S.)
Okay, okay, shoes are coming off.
(as he takes them off)
Okay, Roy.
Roy returns, unlatches and opens the door. Frank enters
and the scent of ammonia slams his nostrils.
FRANK
Mother... You get attacked by Mr.
Clean? Roy, you gotta open a
window.
ROY
Windows.
(as Frank just
stares at him)
Looking for something?
No.

FRANK
My partner. You seen him? He's
been missing most of the week.
(beat)
Tell me you've left the house in
three days.
Roy can't.

FRANK
Have you eaten anything in three
days?
(off Roy's nod)
Besides canned tuna?
(as Roy stops
nodding)
And women tell me my lifestyle's
peculiar.

IN LIVING ROOM

Frank enters.
ROY
Watch -- the rug.
Frank stops short of it.

Looks at Roy.

FRANK
You didn't take your -ROY
I spilled them. Down the garbage
disposal. By accident.
FRANK
You call Mancuso?
He moved.

ROY
FRANK
You gotta be shitting me.
ROY
That's what I said.
A beat.
FRANK
Take a shower. I'm gonna make a
call. My aunt saw this shrink
after her divorce, he really -Frank --

ROY

FRANK
Roy: you need to see someone.
Listen, don't think I'm doing this
just for you. You got money you
can retire, I got car payments,
you know. I don't need a partner
who's --

Frank pantomimes a mad-act spasm. Roy relents. As he
heads for the bathroom, Frank picks up the phone, dials.
Frank.
Yeah?

ROY
FRANK
ROY
Wipe that thing down when you're
done with it, okay?
A beat.

Frank looks to be at the end of his rope.
FRANK
Go take that shower, Roy.

INT. SMALL OFFICE BUILDING COURTYARD

Beside a door, a plaque reads: "DR. HARRIS KLEIN, M.D."
Roy watches from a darkened breezeway, smoking, hands in
coat pockets. He stamps out his cigarette and approaches.

INT. DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roy, at the far end of a small couch, stares at a pair of
Florsheims crossed atop an ottoman. They belong to DR.
KLEIN, who scans Roy's form.
DR. KLEIN
You mind if I put them up?
helps my back.
Go ahead.

It

ROY
DR. KLEIN
(re: his form)
You're something of a clean slate,
Roy. This says you were on
medication but you don't know what
kind.

ROY
They were green capsules. I think
it said P.D.F. on them. Something
like that.
DR. KLEIN
You were getting them illegally?
(as Roy balks)
We're starting fresh today, Roy.
What happened in the past I don't
care about.
ROY
That's a funny thing for a shrink
to say.

Klein smiles; Roy doesn't.
ROY
Yes. I was getting them
illegally.
Why?

DR. KLEIN
ROY
So I wouldn't have to talk to
someone like you. Do you know
what they were?
DR. KLEIN
Yes. And at the dosage you say
you were taking, I'd say you were
lucky to be sitting up straight!-ROY
Can you get me more of them?
DR. KLEIN
Let's talk a little first.
says here you're --

It

ROY
-- I'm sorry, Doc, but my partner,
my buddy Frank -DR. KLEIN
-- Beth Mercer's nephew -(CONTINUED)

ROY
-- he said I could come here and
you'd get me the pills I need. If
you can't do that, this session's
over before it's started.
DR. KLEIN
You certainly get to the point.
ROY
And you skirt it.
the pills or not?

Can you get me

DR. KLEIN
Yes.
ROY
Then let's get that prescription
pad out.
DR. KLEIN
Roy, usually I don't prescribe
medicine unless I've had a little
chat with the patient first. If
you're inclined against that,
then!-- as you say -- this session
will be quite brief.
Roy stares the doctor down.

Klein never blinks.

DR. KLEIN
It says here you're an antiques
dealer. How long you been in that
line?
Nothing from Roy.

The face-off continues.

DR. KLEIN
Would you like to tell me what's
been bothering you?
And continues.

Then, abruptly, Roy quits.

ROY
I get tired a lot, but I can't
sleep. Certain things distract
me, make me feel sick to my
stomach.
DR. KLEIN
What kinds of things?

ROY
When people leave doors open, or
windows. I don't like being
outdoors. They call that
agoraphobia, right?
DR. KLEIN
Incorrectly, but yes. Anything
else?
Dirt.

ROY
Especially around moldings.

Klein makes a note.
DR. KLEIN
Have these distractions affected
your work of late?
(off Roy's nod)
And your personal relationships?
ROY
What personal relationships?
DR. KLEIN
When was the last time you were in
one? A relationship?
ROY
A long time ago.

With a woman?
Five years?

DR. KLEIN
Ten years?
ROY

Keep going.
DR. KLEIN
What was her name?
A beat.
Heather.

ROY
DR. KLEIN
Were you married?
(off Roy's nod)
Kids?
A beat.

Maybe.
Maybe.

ROY
DR. KLEIN
That's a new one.

ROY
She was pregnant when she left me.
Maybe I got a kid, maybe I don't.
DR. KLEIN
You haven't seen her since?
No.

ROY
DR. KLEIN
You haven't spoken?
ROY
She left with a black eye, which I
gave her, and a bun in the oven,
which might have come from anyone.
So, no, I haven't. For all I know
she got hit by a bus. For all I
know she got rid of the baby,
'cause she'd been down that path
before.
(a breath to cool
his temper)
Doc: I spent last Tuesday on my
living room sofa. Watching my
carpet. Watching fibers on my
carpet. And the whole time I was
watching my carpet I was worrying
that I might vomit, and the whole
time I was worrying I might vomit,
I was thinking: I’m a grown man,
I should know what's going on in
my head. And the more I thought
about it the more I realized I
should just blow my brains out and
end it all, but the more I wanted
to blow my brains out, the more I
thought about what that would do
to my goddamn carpet.
(beat)
And that was a good day, Doc. So
gimme some pills and let me get on
with my life.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 10/7/02

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - AT SINK - NIGHT

Roy pushes a blue capsule out of a foil-bottom packet,
downs it with coffee. He stops to think.
AT TABLE
He opens the phone book, flips pages to "F." His finger
scans names, comes up empty. He closes the book in
surrender.
ON PHONE
He hasn't quit yet, poised with pen and pad.
ROY
-- Fenton. F-e-n-t-o-n.
Heather.
(waits, then)
What about in Orange County?

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roy sits on the edge of the bed, staring at Heather's
number. He picks up his phone, starts to dial, then
hangs up. He's scared shitless. He closes his eyes,
breathless, sucks down part of a Winston. Then picks up
the phone again, dials.
ONE RING, TWO RINGS...
Hello -Roy hangs up.

WOMAN (V.O.)
Buries his hands under his armpits.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 10/7/02

INT. DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE

Klein studies Roy.
ROY
I was young, she was very young.
We met in a bar. Discovered we
both had similar interests.
Basically, drinking and -He waves his hand.
DR. KLEIN
Sexual intercourse.
ROY
If you gotta be dirty about it.
Then we got hitched. I don't
think either of us put a whole lot
of thought into it.
DR. KLEIN
And she got pregnant.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

ROY
That was later. After things got
bad. We fought a lot.
About what?

DR. KLEIN
ROY
What have you got?
a lot then -Are you now?

I wasn't sober

DR. KLEIN
ROY
(nods)
-- so some nights she just didn't
come home. She was pregnant two
months before she told me. Which
is why I...
Hit her?

DR. KLEIN
Roy nods.
DR. KLEIN
Do you think about her much? What
could have been, what might have
been.
Roy shakes his head.
And the baby?

DR. KLEIN
ROY
If there's a baby.
DR. KLEIN
Do you think about that?
ROY
Sometimes. Rarely. If I see a
school bus or -- I wonder: Is one
of those kids Roy Jr.?
DR. KLEIN
He -- if he's a he -- would be how
old now?
Fourteen.

ROY

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Fourteen.

DR. KLEIN
Ready to be a man.

If he's a he.

ROY
If he is at all.

INT. DR. KLEIN'S ANTEROOM

Roy waits. Dr. Klein appears from his stockroom/closet
and hands Roy a handful of unlabeled sampler packs.
DR. KLEIN
Congratulations. You bought
yourself a month's worth.
ROY
Doc, do you know of a way of...?
Just to find out...
DR. KLEIN
There's nothing wrong, Roy, with a
man telephoning his ex-wife.
ROY
I tried that last night.
(withdraws the
number from his
shirt pocket)
Couldn't say a word.
Klein looks surprised.
Could you?

Roy pushes the number on him.

ROY
Call her?

DR. KLEIN
I don't know, Roy. I, uh...
ROY
Just to find out.
Klein hesitates: This is unorthodox. But that's what Roy
wants. At last, Klein relents; he takes Heather's number.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY
Roy, rock-like, stares out at the pool.

The PHONE RINGS.

Roy?

DR. KLEIN
(on the answering
machine)
This is Dr. Klein...

Doc...

ROY
(picking up)

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY

Roy's on the portable.
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
I just got off the phone with
Heather. We had a nice
conversation.
ROY
Does she want to talk to me?
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
No. She doesn't. I'm sorry. She
didn't understand it might help
with your therapy.
ROY
You told her I was in therapy.
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
I told her I was a psychiatrist.
I can't lie, Roy. Angela wants to
talk to you, though.
Who?

ROY
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
Angela. Your daughter. She knows
you're her father, and she says
she really wants to meet you.
Roy can't move or speak for a moment.

Then:

ROY
Doc, can you hold the line a
moment?

Roy cups the phone. Carries it inside the bathroom.
Turns on the light and shuts the door behind him.
Through the door: The unmistakable convulsions of a man
puking up everything he has. Then:
Where?

ROY (O.S.)

MOVING SHOT
MOVING UNDER a highway sign:

SAN PEDRO.

Then DOWN TO: Roy's Caprice, Roy at the wheel, white
knuckles at two and ten.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK - DAY

Except for one young mother and her infant, empty.
Stopped across the street, Roy checks his watch -- he's
early. He burrows out a cigarette, lights it, and
unrolls his window an eighth of an inch.

SAME SCENE - LATER

Roy is chain-lighting his next cigarette, then pushing
the old butt through the window crack, when in his side
mirror: A YOUNG GIRL floats INTO VIEW atop a skateboard.
Pretty but not fully formed, slender but not fragile.
She rides past his Caprice, then dismounts and walks into
the park.
Roy doesn't move.

SAME SCENE - LATER

The Young Girl sits waiting, rolling her skateboard backand-forth. Roy remains in his car, watching, amazed,
bewildered.

SAME SCENE - LATER

The Girl stands, looks this way and that, then gives up.
She mounts her board and starts away, and as she passes
Roy's car, he can see: there's disappointment in her
eyes.

ROY
Shit.

Roy throws open his car door.
Hey -- hey!!

ROY
The Girl stops. Roy stumbles out of his Caprice, clothes
disheveled, cigarette dangling from his mouth.
You Angela?
You Roy?
He nods.

ROY
ANGELA (YOUNG GIRL)
Father and daughter meet.

ON PARK SWINGS

Angela rocks gently. Roy stands nearby, on pavement, not
sand, hands deep in his pockets. He doesn't know what to
say, except:
ROY
You're fourteen.

So:
Yep.

ANGELA
She swings a little more.
ANGELA
When'd you get out?
What?
Of prison.

ROY
ANGELA
A beat.
ROY
I've never been in prison.
Oh.

ANGELA

ROY
Your mom tell you that?
ANGELA
First she told me you were dead.
Then she said you might as well
be.
I'm not dead.

ROY
I'm in antiques.

ANGELA
That's what the doctor said. On
the phone. When he said that, Mom
started to laugh.
Roy glances about, anxious.
ROY
You -- you hungry?
(as she shrugs)
Do you mind eating? It's just -I'd feel better somewhere indoors.
I get uncomfortable sometimes
being outside.
She gives him a curious look.

INT. SAN PEDRO DINER

Angela is served an enormous meal (turkey, mashed and
gravy, chocolate shake), and Roy takes note from across
the table.
ROY
I thought you weren't hungry.
ANGELA
You're gonna get wet, might as
well go swimming.
ROY
What's that thing with girls -where they don't eat?
ANGELA
(mouth full)
Anorexia.

ROY
At least we know you don't have
that.
ANGELA
I could have bulimia. That's when
you go in the bathroom after and
vomit.

She continues to eat.

Roy studies her face.

ANGELA
You're staring.
ROY
Sorry.
ANGELA
That's okay. I used to do it,
too. Look at your picture and see
if I got your nose or your eyes.
Mom used to say I got lucky and
only got your elbows.
ROY
How is your mom?
ANGELA
Fine.
Roy waits: Is there more information forthcoming?
Angela eats, deliberately: No, there isn't.
ROY
So you're in school, right?
Not now.

ANGELA
It's summer.

ROY
Right. Well, school's real
important. If I had anything to
do over again, I'd work harder in
school.
You drop out?

ANGELA
Roy hesitates, then nods.
ANGELA
That why you ended up a criminal?

She takes a long, noisy slurp from her shake, sucking up
the dregs with her straw as she studies Roy.
You finished?

ROY
ANGELA
It's okay, you know. Whatever you
do. Everybody's done something
bad in their life -ROY
-- I'm in antiques -ANGELA
-- if you make it a career, it's just
a lot of something strung together -ROY
Cut the shit, huh? I'm not a
criminal.
(beat)
Sorry. I shouldn't've -ANGELA
(mock shock)
What -- what was that word?
'Shi...t'?
(unfazed)
When's the last time you saw each
other, you and Mom?
ROY
Before you were born.
ANGELA
You still love her?
He doesn't know how to answer.
ANGELA
'Cause she still hates you, you know.
Yeah.

ROY
I pretty much figured that.

INT. HIS CAPRICE - MOVING

Roy drives. Angela, snooping, opens the glove
compartment, eyes a pack of cigarettes along with Roy's
pink slip, proof of insurance, fake FTC identification.

ROY
(shooing her away)
Hey, hey...

Looking up the street:
ANGELA
Stop, stop, stop. That's her car
in the driveway. You better drop
me here.

EXT. HEATHER'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Roy pulls over.
how.

Time to say good-bye.

Got a pen?

He doesn't know

ANGELA
He does. She takes it, then his hand, and writes a
telephone number on his palm.
ANGELA
This is my private line. Mom got
it for me for my birthday. 'Cause
my friend Carrie kept on calling
after midnight. Maybe we could go
bowling some time.
Roy is caught off-guard by the suggestion.
out, then leans back in.

Angela leaps

ANGELA
Nice meeting you, Dad.
She closes the door. Roy watches her skate away, then
glances at the number written on his palm. It absolutely
bewilders him.
FRANK (V.O.)
What's more important than family?

INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Roy's at his desk. Copying the number fading from his
palm. He can't help but smile. Meanwhile, Frank works
the phones, fighting the monotony of cold calling.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

FRANK
Then what could be more important
than purifying the water your
family drinks? The Waterford II
offers you the cleanest filtration
system available today.
(notices Roy's smile)
Mr. Schlickling, can you hold just
one moment? Thank you.
(muting the phone,
to Roy)
What?
Huh?

ROY
FRANK
You're smiling. You switch
shampoos or something?
(beat)
Pills working?
(as Roy nods)
Glad one of us is happy.
ROY
(moment's thought, then)
How much money you think we could
take that guy for? Chuck, with
the boat.
(off Frank's
astonishment)
Figure I owe you one.
Frank can't believe it.
the phone:

He stares at Roy.

Then back on

FRANK
Mr. Schlickling? Hi, I'm sorry: you
waited too long, no prize for you.
And he hangs up.

EXT. CAR WASH - DAY

CHUCK FRECHETTE -- swarthy, forty-something, new-money
suit -- brow-beats the illegal alien who's towel-drying
his Mercedes (complete with bumper sticker "I'd Rather Be
Sailing"). Across the street, Roy and Frank scout him.
ROY
(tell me again)
What's his last name?

Frechette.

FRANK
Chuck Frechette.

ROY
How do you spell it?
FRANK
F-R... Hell if I know, he's from
Downey.
ROY
Where'd you find him?
FRANK
Cheetah's. Watched him drop two
G's there a month ago.
Cheetah's?

ROY
FRANK
It's a gentlemen's -ROY
I know what it is.

What's he do?

FRANK
Import/export.
ROY
He's not connected, is he?
FRANK
He and the mob are like this -Frank holds two fingers far apart. Meanwhile,
Frechette's MERCEDES is as dry as it's gonna get. He
gets in and PEELS AWAY, leaving his dryer's upturned palm
empty.
ROY
Sonovabitch didn't even tip.
FRANK
I figure on short notice he could
scratch up at least thirty grand.

More.

ROY
(beat)
Music to Frank's ears.

Roy KEYS the IGNITION.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

EXT. FIRST FEDERAL BANK - DAY
Roy enters.

As we hear him continue --

ROY (V.O.)
We'll pull the Jamaican switch on
him. He knows you, so you're rope,
I'm inside. Think he knows anything
about international finance?
-- he moves briskly through -59

INT. FIRST FEDERAL BANK - LOBBY - DAY

-- and -60

INT. FIRST FEDERAL BANK - STAIRS

-- then into -61

INT. FIRST FEDERAL BANK - VAULT ANTEROOM

-- where he approaches a CLERK.
CLERK
May I help you?
ROY
I'd like to access my safe deposit
box. J-215.
CLERK
(offering a form)
Signature and pass code, please.

INT. BANK VAULT

The bank Clerk removes a large safety deposit box, sets
it on a viewing table, then leaves Roy alone with it.
Roy opens it, then withdraws from his jacket two
envelopes -- one white, one manila.

INT. ROY'S SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roy faces his professional costume closet: several
suits, high to low end, plus a gallery of pristine shoes,
a number of pairs of eyeglasses. Roy tries on a pair,
checks himself in the mirror.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roy on the phone again.
Where?

ROY
(checking his watch)
Where else. One hour.
He hangs up. A KNOCK at the door. Roy looks alarmed.
He just got off the phone with Frank -- who else could
that be?
AT FRONT DOOR
Opening on Angela, backpack and skateboard at her feet.
Remember me?

ANGELA
Roy nods, bemused.
ROY
You just in the neighborhood?
Took the bus.
in a sec?

ANGELA
Think I could come

Panic flickers across Roy's face. No one but Frank has
crossed this threshold in many years. He opens the door
wider and she steps inside. She peers about.
Nice.
Huh?

ANGELA
ROY
ANGELA
It's nice. Your place. I bet
you're wondering how I got your
address.
He wasn't.
ANGELA
Off your car insurance, in your
glove compartment.
Roy feels suddenly uncomfortable in his own home.

ROY
So what's going on?
ANGELA
Mom and I had sort of a fight. It
happens once in a while. I
usually take off for a day or two
to let her calm down.
Take off?

ROY
ANGELA
Normally I go to Carrie's. Only
her family's on vacation. And I
thought, since we seemed to hit it
off so good last time -(hoping Roy will
complete the thought;
he doesn't)
-- I could sleep on the couch?
ROY
(cardiac arrest)
You wanna stay here?
ANGELA
I could pay you back by cleaning
up or something -(as she gazes around
spotless room; then re:
his glasses)
You wear those to read? They make
you look kinda old.
ROY
These're just for -(remembering)
I gotta go. I got a business
meeting.
This late?

ANGELA
ROY
Antiques wait for no man.
(half to himself, half
to her)
Is it okay if I leave you here?
Sure.

ANGELA
I can watch TV.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Roy searches around the room, as if a television will
magically appear.
ANGELA
You don't have a TV? You
seriously don't have a TV?
He smiles, sheepishly.
ROY
There's a couch. If you want to
sit. Or there if you prefer. Or
the couch.
She moves to the couch, amused by his nervousness; of
course, she treads right across the carpet. Roy averts
his eyes, starts for the door...
ROY
You want me to pick up anything on
the way back? Ice cream?
ANGELA
New York Super Fudge Chunk.
What?

ROY
ANGELA
That's my favorite flavor.
York Super Fudge Chunk.
New York...?

New

ROY
ANGELA
Super Fudge Chunk.
ROY
Chocolate. Don't open the door
for anybody.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Quietly as he can, Roy locks the front door. Hesitates
for a moment. Can he do this -- leave a fourteen-yearold girl alone in his house? He must.

EXT. CHEETAH'S STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

Roy pulls his Caprice into a distant view of the club.
Frank taps on the passenger side window and Roy unlocks
the door.
FRANK
(re: Roy's glasses)
Hey, I like those. They make you
look -ROY
Old?

Older.

FRANK
(hesitates, then)
ROY
How long's he been inside?
FRANK
Twenty minutes.
ROY
You got your lines down?
FRANK
You got my money?
Roy withdraws the standard white envelope from his jacket
and flings it at Frank.

INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT

As glamorous an establishment as you might imagine. Roy
enters, pays the cover charge at the door and spots -- by
way of a mirror -- Chuck Frechette drinking alone at the
bar. He finds himself a table.

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

While Roy's away, Angela snoops.
just clothes.

Here she opens drawers:

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Here she opens cupboards:
Sea.

just cans of Chicken-of-the-

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Here she stands on a chair and pries atop bookshelves:
nothing here, not even dust. But from this perch, the
ceramic horse in the corner draws her attention.

INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT

As Roy sips a club soda:
Good evening.

STRIPPER
His eyes stray up to hers (who knows the last time he
faced a bare midriff) -STRIPPER
Care for a dance?
-- then flash to the door as Frank enters. Frank spots
Roy and heads his way. Roy glances back at the bar:
Frechette, eyes on the girls, didn't notice Frank enter.
Not just now.

ROY
The Stripper departs, passing Frank.
FRANK
Thanks, honey. Come back later
for me, though, okay?
Frank stands over Roy and extends his hand.
Arden.

FRANK
Hope I didn't keep you.

ROY
(rising to shake)
Good to see you, Bob.
(voice dropping)
At the bar. He missed you come
in.
Frank nods, then whistles to a passing waitress, loudly:
FRANK
Hey, can I get a Bud?!
Everyone turns their heads at that, including Frechette,
who recognizes Frank.

FRANK
(back to Roy)
That do the trick?
Let's sit.

ROY
They do. Frechette starts off his barstool toward them.
Roy monitors his approach.
FRANK
We in business?
ROY
On my next drink.
Another stripper passes, and Roy's distracted an instant.
FRANK
I told you you'd like it here.
Roy picks up his drink, cueing Frank to reach into his
windbreaker, remove the white envelope, and drop it on
the table -FRANK
Don't spend it all on one girl,
huh?
-- so that it lands just as Frechette arrives, tie tugged
loose, whiskey in hand.
Hey, Bob...

FRECHETTE
FRANK
(he turns)
Hey, Chuck, I didn't know you were
here.
Frank stands to shake hands, but Frechette's eyes drop to
the white envelope on the table: a slim stack of $100's
peeks out from within. Roy notes Frechette's glance and
quickly palms the envelope into his lap.
FRANK
(awkwardly)
Ah, Chuck Frechette, this is my
friend, Arden -Roy shoots Frank a look:

no names.

Frank shuts up.

FRECHETTE

Hiya.
Roy nods hello, none-too-pleased, then resumes his stare
at Frank: get him out of here.
FRANK
(to Frechette,
confidentially)
Say, Chuck, we got a little
business to settle up here.
mind if --

You

Frechette gets the idea fast: something not-quite-legal
is going down here, and he's not welcome.
FRECHETTE
I'll be over at the

Sure, Bob.
bar.
Great.

FRANK
Thanks.

FRECHETTE
(to Roy)
Nice meeting you.
Frechette retreats, curiosity piqued.
down.

Frank sits back

FRANK
Fish in a barrel.
Roy waits until Frechette has returned to his barstool
and is clandestinely watching and then -FRECHETTE'S POV
-- he removes the manila envelope from his coat and hands
it to Frank/"Bob": a trade.
BACK WITH ROY AND FRANK
As Frank glances inside Roy's manila envelope (filled
with British pounds), Roy glances at Frechette, whose
attention jerks back to the girls.
He's piqued.

ROY
You good to go?

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

FRANK
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
ROY
Just say yes, okay?
(rising)
So long, Bob.
FRANK
See you in the morning, Arden.
Roy leaves Frank, ignoring Frechette on his way out the
door. As soon as he's gone, Frechette starts toward
Frank.

INT. SUPERMARKET - AT FREEZER - NIGHT

Roy picks his way through various cartons of ice cream.
Squints through his fogged glasses, then remembers he
does not need them.

AT SAME CHECK-OUT - NIGHT

A carton of New York Super Fudge Chunk makes its way down
the conveyor to join a few more cans of tuna. The CheckOut Woman adds a pack of Winstons to the bunch.
CHECK-OUT WOMAN
Big night planned?
ROY
Oh, it's not for me.

Huh?
Right.

CHECK-OUT WOMAN
You have kids overnight?

Roy laughs at the absurdity of this. The Check-Out Woman
doesn't understand, of course, but she laughs with him.

INT. ROY'S

HOUSE - NIGHT

Roy enters, locks the door behind him.
Angela?

ROY
She sleeps atop the couch, arms and legs splayed every
which way. Roy approaches, sets down the ice cream,
and!--!for the first time in his career as parent -finds a blanket to drape over her.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Roy?

ANGELA
(groggily)

Go to sleep.

ROY
ANGELA
How was your meeting?
Good.

ROY
I sold a nice piece.

Angela smiles, half-asleep.

He starts to go.

ANGELA
Why'd Mom leave you?
ROY
You'd have to ask her.
ANGELA
I did. She didn't want to talk
about it. Called you names.
That's why we got into a fight.
Roy smiles.

Touched she stuck up for him.

ANGELA
She said you were a bad guy.
don't seem like a bad guy.

You

ROY
That's what makes me good at it.
He rises, heads to his room, and just before he turns off
the living room light, Angela rolls over under her
blanket, eyes closed, murmuring:
ANGELA
I don't think you're a bad guy.
Roy smiles, shuts the light off.
KNOCK.

Immediately:

KNOCK-

INT. ROY'S FRONT DOOR - NEXT MORNING

Frank is knocking. Roy opens the door, squints at the
light, careful not to let Frank peer in.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

FRANK
I wish you could have been there.
Oh, I reeled him in -ROY
Do we have to do this now?
FRANK
I got your money.
Shh-shh-shh.

ROY
Conscious of Angela asleep inside, Roy slides out the
door and closes it behind him.
FRANK
What's going on?
(shocked)
You don't have someone in there?

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - DAY

Roy and Frank huddle on the sidewalk, Roy out of doors
and anxious. Frank returns the manila envelope to him.
FRANK
The second you left the place, he
was off his barstool. He's in.
Oh, man, is he in. He wants to
meet tonight.
Roy glances back at his house.
slightly: is Angela spying?

A window shade shifts

ROY
Push it to tomorrow. Lunch. Let
his greed meet his imagination.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Roy returns to find his couch empty and the shower water
running in the bathroom. He seizes the opportunity to
sneak both envelopes of cash into the ceramic horse.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - DAY
Angela, her hair still wet, digs a spoon into the pint of
New York Super Fudge Chunk. Roy, meanwhile, sneaks his
morning medication down his throat.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

ROY
You sure I can't give you a ride
home?
That's okay.

Roy reacts:
him.

ANGELA
Mom can pick me up.

the prospect of confronting Heather rattles

ANGELA
Who was that guy who came by
earlier?
Who?

Oh.

ROY
A business associate.

ANGELA
What's his name?
Frank.

ROY
ANGELA
How come you didn't want him to
see me?
ROY
I didn't not want him to see you.
(re: ice cream)
Shouldn't you... eat eggs or
something?
ANGELA
All you've got here is tuna. Lots
and lots of tuna. And one TV
dinner. TV dinners are cool. You
should get the TV to go with 'em.
Roy stiffens, pissed:

someone went snooping.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Angela's on the phone:
ANGELA
Hi... No... No... Guess...
(beat)
What if I am? So? He's my
father...
(MORE)

ANGELA (CONT'Dbeat)
I don't care. I don't care. I
will if I want.

Across the room, Roy grows more distressed as Angela
grows more petulant. Now she quiets down.
ANGELA
I know. I know. Okay, I promise.
Yes, I promise! 'Bye.
She hangs up abruptly.
ROY
She mad?
At me.

ANGELA
Not you.

Roy looks relieved.
ANGELA
She said she was gonna call the
police -So much for relief.
ANGELA
-- but now she just wants me home
in time for summer school.
When's that?

ROY
ANGELA
Monday.
ROY
Today's Thursday.
ANGELA
That's okay, isn't it?

INT. KLEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roy is doubled over on the couch, his arms sagging down
across his legs, head buried between his knees.

DR. KLEIN
And one more time, deeply...
(as Roy breathes in)
Hold it -- one, two, three,
four!-- and out.
ROY
You've got stains.
DR. KLEIN
I beg your pardon?
ROY
In your carpet.
DR. KLEIN
You can sit up.
(as Roy does)
Is that what you were thinking
about? Stains in my carpet?
ROY
And that I have a fourteen-yearold girl I barely know living in
my house.
DR. KLEIN
It's just for the weekend.
ROY
But I've got a -- there's a big
piece coming on the market I'm
brokering and -- it's just not a
good time.
DR. KLEIN
When is it ever a good time for
anything? I realize this is
sudden, Roy, and you may feel
unprepared, but trust me, they’re
not so difficult, kids. Most of
all you have to focus on the
basics: make sure they eat their
vegetables, don 't stay up too
late, and don't watch too much TV.
Otherwise just try to be as honest
and open with them as possible.

Roy eyes a picture of two little boys atop Klein's desk.
ROY
As honest and open as possible.

DR. KLEIN
She's your daughter, Roy. Unless
there's another ex-wife you
haven't told me about, she's the
only one you got.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY/GARAGE - DAY

Roy pulls home, pushing a pill from its packet,
swallowing it dry, his second dose of the day. He gets
out to find -83

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Angela lies by the pool on a beach towel in a bikini and
dark glasses, reading a magazine.
ANGELA
How'd the meeting go?
okay?

Did it go

Confronted by his daughter's breasts, hips and calves,
Roy walks straight into the house.
ANGELA
What's the matter? You freaking
out about something?

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
Squash, broccoli, artichokes, cauliflower, etc.
behind a cart, Roy stares at them blankly.

Standing

In the frozen food aisle, Roy reads directions on a
package of frozen spinach. Angela appears behind him,
carrying chips, cookies, and a six-pack of beer.
ROY
Who's that for?
ANGELA
Don't you drink?

Do you?

ROY
(shakes his head)

Come on.

ANGELA
I'm fourteen.

Roy isn't sure which way to take that.

IN LINE FOR ROY'S USUAL CHECK-OUT WOMAN

Roy and Angela wait behind two other shoppers.
ANGELA
The line for that one's shorter.
ROY
This one's better.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Roy cooks.

His first attempt in years.

He serves. Limp spinach and sauceless spaghetti. Seated
at his breakfast table, neither he nor Angela look too
ecstatic about digging in.
He surrenders. A pizza delivery box takes center stage
on the breakfast table; the spinach and pasta lie
untouched in the kitchen sink. Angela bites into a slice
as Roy forks a fresh can of tuna.

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - MORNING

The morning ritual begins again. Roy, dressed, leaves
his bedroom, closes its door behind him, proceeds to the
bathroom door, opens it -ANGELA (O.S.)
Just a minute.
Roy closes it fast.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Roy cleans his coffee mug/wipes down the sink/waits.
He's pissed his morning routine has been interrupted.

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - DAY

Angela exits, in a towel, allowing Roy to enter -90

INT. ROY'S BATHROOM - DAY
It looks like a circus act of seals has come and gone.
Water everywhere, used towels, underpants hanging from a
faucet. Roy uses a piece of toilet paper to remove them.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

INT. STEAK HOUSE - DAY
Roy, bespectacled again, sits at a table with Frank and
Frechette, who are halfway through lunch. Roy sticks
with just coffee.
ROY
Bob tells me you're a yachtsman.
FRECHETTE
Hardly. Just a forty-two footer I
take out on weekends. You sail?
ROY
I get seasick in the tub.
FRANK
Arden, you sure you don't want
something?
ROY
I gotta fly in two hours.
(To Frechette)
The cast iron stomach again.
Thanks.

FRECHETTE
Where you off to?
ROY
Phoenix. A client's setting up a
funding account to bridge the
pound and the euro, I've got to
hold his hand.
(to passing waitress)
Hon: could you heat this up a
little, please?
FRECHETTE
That bad, huh?
ROY
For some folks, money is a foreign
film without subtitles. Anyway,
to the business at hand.
FRANK
To the business at hand.
ROY
I have one rule, Chuck: simple is
safe. I'm going to tell you as
little as possible about me and
what I do, but as much as I need
to make you comfortable with what
we're doing.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

51A.

(A1)

FRECHETTE
What are we doing?
Roy removes a manila envelope from his jacket, just as he
did at Cheetah's, but reaches it under the table to
Frechette. Frechette peeks inside: thin stacks of
hundred pound notes.
FRECHETTE
How much is it?

ROY
Five thousand pounds sterling.
One of the perks of working in the
exchange program at a bank.
Whose is it?

FRECHETTE
ROY
No one's in particular. Just a
little money unaccounted for,
floating on top the books like a
layer of cream.
FRANK
And he just scoops it off.
ROY
It's a little more complicated
than that but again: simple is
safe.
FRECHETTE
Why not keep the money yourself?
ROY
As a bank employee any attempt I
make to change currency is
recorded and questioned. Bob has
a record. You, on the other hand,
no one bats an eye.
(beat)
Now I hope you have something for
me.
Frechette nods, removes an envelope from his jacket and
reaches it under the table.
FRECHETTE
Five grand American.
Roy checks, pockets Frechette's money.
ROY
Congratulations. At today's
exchange rate, you just made two
thousand -FRECHETTE
-- five hundred sixty-seven
dollars. I looked it up on the
Internet.

FRANK
The frickin' Internet.

I still

FRECHETTE
Neither can I. But my daughter's
a wiz at the thing.
Roy goes off-book.
ROY
You have a daughter?
Two.

FRECHETTE
Fifteen and twelve.

ROY
I have a fourteen-year-old.
FRECHETTE
It's a riot, huh? Training bras
hanging from your shower rod...
ROY
... and everything smells like
gum.
(suddenly has a
thousand questions
to ask Frechette)
How do you get 'em out of the
house? Mine just sits at home all
day.
FRECHETTE
Summer's the worst.
Frank reacts:

what the hell is Roy talking about?

EXT. STEAK HOUSE - DAY

At the valet station:
FRECHETTE
Lemme ask you something, Arden:
how much could you do this for?
Hypothetically.
As a rule:
ten --

FRANK

Roy quiets Frank, eyes Chuck.
ROY
How much could you get your hands
on?
Frechette smiles.
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Stiffing his valet, Frechette drives his Mercedes away.
Frank and Roy watch him go. Frank sighs in relief.
FRANK
For a second I thought we were out
two grand.
ROY
You gotta spend money to make
money.
FRANK
But you gotta make it to spend it.
(beat)
'Everything smells like gum?'
What was that about?
Roy hesitates, then:
ROY
It's easier if I show you.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - DAY

Roy unlocks the front door and enters, with Frank behind
him. From within:
ROY
Angela, I'm back!
(beat)
Angela? Frank's here!
(farther inside)
Angela?
Angela!

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Frank reads a fashion magazine from Angela's bag.

ROY
She's not here. She must have
gone back to her mom's.
FRANK
Her bag's still here.

Where does

ROY
I don't know. I don't know
anything about her.
FRANK
This is no good for you, Roy.

Or

ROY
It's got nothing to do with us.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

Roy can be seen through the blinds, watching the pool,
turning its light on and off.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

An ashtray overflows on the coffee table. Roy waits on
the couch and lights a fresh one. He checks his watch:
it's late. A dull THUNK comes from the back of the
house.

INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT
As Roy opens the door:
The window is open.

Angela is brushing off her jeans.

ROY
Where have you been?
Nowhere.

ANGELA
ROY
I've been waiting over an hour.
Where did you go?
ANGELA
I went to the arcade. It's only
like a half-mile away.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

He moves to the window, shuts it.
ANGELA
It's stuffy in here. This whole
house smells like Lysol.
ROY
Where the hell were you? I want
to know right now or I'm calling
your mother.
ANGELA
I told you, the arcade -ROY
Why'd you sneak back in?
ANGELA
That's how I left. I don't have
keys to lock the door.
ROY
You didn't see my car?
Roy squats to pluck up specks of dirt Angela tracked in.
ANGELA
Jeez, you're worse than Mom.
ROY
Listen, Angela: I'm glad we met,
but I've got a business, a
partner, and I've got things a
certain way, and that's it. So I
think it would be better, for you
most of all, if tomorrow morning I
took you back home.
Roy brushes the dirt into a trash can.
ANGELA
What did I do wrong?
ROY
You didn't do anything wrong.
ANGELA
I just went out. I didn't drink,
I didn't get high, and I didn't
take any money out of your stupid
horse.
(as Roy goes white)
So, what, you never heard of a
bank?

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roy slides the head off his ceramic horse, checks his
.38, then starts pulling out wads of cash.
As he counts it, FOOTSTEPS march down the hall,
punctuated by the front DOOR SLAMMING. Roy looks up.
Should he go after her? He turns back to his money: it
looks all there.

EXT. ROY'S STREET - NIGHT
Angela stalks away from Roy's house, book bag and
skateboard in hand. Roy emerges far behind her and runs
to catch her. She, meanwhile, mounts her board.
ROY
I wasn't kicking you out.

Angela!

ANGELA
I don't want to stay where I'm not
wanted.
ROY
It's not that I don't want you.
Fooled me.

ANGELA
ROY
Will you stop?
He catches her.
ANGELA
Let me go.
(as he does)
You just don't want me going home
to Mom saying she was right all
along. You're like one of her
boyfriends: I'm just something
you have to deal with in order to
screw her.
Angela...

ROY
ANGELA
(much too loudly)
Even they tell me what they do for
a living. Oh, yeah, antique
dealers always keep large stacks
of cash in their homes. Right
next to their guns...

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Roy shushes her, but he knows:

she's got him.

ROY
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm
just... not good at being a
father, alright? You know? I
barely get by as me.
Roy takes his hand out of his coat pocket to wipe a tear
off her cheek. She recoils.
ROY
Will you come back home with me?
We can get pizza again.
She won't budge.
ROY
You can stay the whole weekend if
you want.
She won't budge.
but:

Roy doesn't know what else to offer

ANGELA
Why do you have a gun?
In case.
In case what?
Roy is stuck.

ROY
ANGELA
He sighs, resigned.

ROY
It's a little hard to explain.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Angela and Roy face off over another pizza.
Bullshit.

ANGELA
ROY
Nope. No bullshit. And watch
your language at the table.
ANGELA
You're a con man?

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

58A.

ROY
Con artist. Flim-flam man,
matchstick man, take your pick.
ANGELA
And that guy Frank?
My partner.

ROY
My protege.

She considers it.
ANGELA
Bullshit.
ROY

I told you:

ANGELA
Teach me something.
ROY
What?
ANGELA
Teach me something. A con.
You're funny.

ROY
ANGELA
Teach me something.
ROY
I am not going to teach you
anything.
Why not?

ANGELA
ROY
Because. You're a beautiful,
bright, innocent girl, and I'm not
going to screw that up like
everything else.
ANGELA
Really, you think that?
What?

ROY
ANGELA
That I'm beautiful?
A beat.

No.

ROY
(deadpan)

ANGELA
Then why won't you?!
(mockingly)
Because crime doesn't pay?
ROY
No. It does pay.
well.

Just not very

ANGELA
You seem to be doing okay by it.
Roy stops.
ROY
I'm not. Believe me. It's not
fun doing what I do. A lot of the
time it's stealing from people who
don't deserve it. Old people.
Fat people. A lot of the time I
feel sick about it.
ANGELA
(calling his bluff)
Then why do you keep doing it?
Roy has no answer.

INT. ROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
As Roy brushes his teeth, Angela sits atop the toilet.
ANGELA
I'm not as innocent as you think.
I've done stuff with boys. I've
done stuff, if I told you, you'd
probably throw up right here.
ROY
Then don't tell me.
ANGELA
Teach me something!
No!

ROY
ANGELA
At the Christmas dance last year,
I went with this boy, Josh Ward,
he's cute and I really really
liked him...

ROY
I'm not listening.
ANGELA
After the dance, at Carrie's, we
went upstairs, and he pushed me up
against the bed...
ROY
I'm not listening.
ANGELA
And he took his hand...
One thing!
thing!

ROY
I'll show you one

She nearly jumps for joy. Kisses him on the cheek,
getting toothpaste on her face, then skips down the hall.
ROY
And then you're never gonna do it
again. You're gonna forget it.
Agreed?
But she's already frolicking into the living room.

INT. ROY'S CAPRICE - DAY
Cruising down the freeway. Angela brings a notebook out
of her backpack full of laundry.
ANGELA
Where we going?
ROY
Rule number one. Never work near
where you live.
ANGELA

'Don't... shit... where... you...'
ROY

notebook)
Rule number two. Don't write
anything down.

Angela

ROY
Stay in the car.
(as she still follows)
Stay in the car.
She still follows.

Roy gives up.

INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY

Roy marks a lottery ticket as Angela watches: four of
the five numbers -- 6, 18, 22, 49, 60 -- which (a
prominent sign displays) won the day before. To the
CASHIER:
ROY
I want to play this for the
drawing on the twenty-second.
CASHIER
You know the odds of the lottery
hitting the same numbers in the
same month, the same numbers ever?
ROY
That's why I changed one.
CASHIER
You're wasting your dollar.
ANGELA
You his financial advisor?
No.

CASHIER
ANGELA
No. You're a cashier at a 7-Eleven.
Take his dollar and give him a
ticket for the twenty-second.
The Cashier hops to it.

Roy considers Angela, amused.

ROY
You sure you're ready for this?
ANGELA
I was born ready.
ROY
I'm glad I missed that day.

INT. ROY'S CAPRICE

Roy crumples up his lottery ticket, rolls it in his hand,
scratches hard at it with his fingernail. Angela,
sipping on a Big Gulp, takes it from him.
ANGELA
I've got longer nails.
Roy watches her scratch away with all her might.
ROY
Just the... right.
(beat)
Okay. Most important thing you
have to understand about this game
is: ninety percent of it is
variable. No matter how good your
plan is, you almost always get
thrown a curveball. So you have
to be flexible, prepared to roll
with anything. The one thing you
can control, though, is who your
mark is. That's your ten percent.

EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Angela enters, backpack on her arm. She cases the joint.
A single man, black, sits reading Tolstoy.
ROY (V.O.)
Never play someone who's not
buying what you're selling. What
you're selling is you.
An elderly couple separates whites and colors.
ROY (V.O.)
The older the better, but beware
of couples. You don't want anyone
whispering in your mark's ear but
you.
A boy in his teens returns her interest.
ROY (V.O.)
And, for God's sake, make sure the
person you're conning isn't
conning you.
Angela gives him a get-lost look, then turns to a middleaged HOUSEWIFE loading three machines. Angela
approaches.

Three boys.
ANGELA
Any of 'em cute?
The Housewife smiles, and Angela smiles back: she has
her mark. She sets her bag down, stealthily planting the
lottery ticket beneath it.

SAME SCENE - LATER

Angela and the Housewife transfer their laundry to
dryers.
HOUSEWIFE
Simon's about your age, but you'd
never guess; he's so hyper. You
know, girls really do mature much
faster than boys.
ANGELA
That's what I keep telling my
brothers.
HOUSEWIFE
They don't go to Fremont, do they?
Central.

ANGELA
Her dryer full, Angela picks up her backpack to go.
ANGELA
I'm gonna get a Coke across the
street. Do you want anything?

HOUSEWIFE
No thanks, honey.

Angela starts off, and the Housewife notices the lottery
ticket left behind.
HOUSEWIFE
Honey, you dropped something.
She holds it for her to see.
ANGELA
It's not mine.
You sure?

HOUSEWIFE
ANGELA
Gotta be eighteen to play.
HOUSEWIFE
Huh. Looks like someone put it
through the wash by accident.
It's for yesterday's drawing.
That says the second, don't you
think?
Angela inspects it, too: thanks to her and Roy's
handiwork, the date looks like the second, not the
twenty-second.
ANGELA
Probably a loser.
The Housewife nods, and Angela continues on her way.
on second thought:

But

HOUSEWIFE
We should at least see if it hit.
ACROSS LAUNDRY
A man reads a newspaper.
Angela.

The Housewife approaches with

HOUSEWIFE
Excuse me, sir? Could we borrow
your paper a sec? We're looking
for lottery results.
The newspaper drops.

The man is Roy.

ROY
I think it's Metro...

Sure.

Roy hands her the section. The Housewife opens it,
passes Angela the ticket. Roy rises to feed a dryer
(whose clothes are inside is anybody's guess).
HOUSEWIFE
Ready? Six, eighteen, thirty,
forty-nine, sixty.
Wait, wait.

ANGELA
Six, eighteen, what?

HOUSEWIFE
Thirty, forty-nine, sixty.
ANGELA
You're sure?
(as Housewife nods)
Missed by one.
Thirty?

HOUSEWIFE
You're joking.
Look!

ANGELA
HOUSEWIFE
You mean we missed by one
number -- ?
She looks -- it's true! They laugh, a little breathless,
a little crestfallen. Then, it's back to the wash.
HOUSEWIFE
Story of my life.
Mine, too.

ANGELA
ROY
(as he returns)
Any luck?
ANGELA
Four out of five, can you believe
it?
ROY
Four out of five pays, you know.

Angela and the Housewife share a look, astonished.
HOUSEWIFE
It does?
ROY
Call the number on the ticket.

EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

The Housewife's on a pay phone.

Angela hovers nearby.

HOUSEWIFE
(into phone)
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Thank you very
much.
She hangs up.
ANGELA
What'd they say?
HOUSEWIFE
(face erupting)
We won six hundred dollars!
ANGELA
Holy -She cups her mouth:

oops.
HOUSEWIFE
Six hundred dollars!

-- shit!
Holy shit!

ANGELA
Roy watches from inside as they laugh and hug.
HOUSEWIFE
The woman on the phone said we
just have to take it in for
verification. And then they'll
mail me a check.
(quickly)
I'll give you half, sweetie, don't
worry.
ANGELA
You don't have to...

HOUSEWIFE
No, no, we're fifty-fifty in this.
In fact, we should call your mom
and we can all go down there
together.

Angela pulls back.
She works.

ANGELA
Pretty late.

HOUSEWIFE
How 'bout your dad?
ANGELA
(ashamed)
He -- he doesn't live with us
anymore. You know, it's okay.
I'm supposed to be home anyway.
No, no, no.

Then she

EXT. BANK ATM - SECURITY CAMERA POV

The Housewife uses the ATM; Angela's feet are barely IN
FRAME behind her. Angela very consciously keeps OUT OF
the CAMERA'S RANGE.

EXT. ACROSS STREET

Roy watches from inside his Caprice.
ROY
Good girl, watch the cameras.

AT ATM

The Housewife hands Angela three crisp $100s.
HOUSEWIFE
That’s three hundred. Don't spend
it all at the coin-op. And hide
it when you get home. Don't let
those brothers of yours anywhere
near it.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

ANGELA
(touched)
Thank you.
HOUSEWIFE
Thank you, sweetie.

They hug again.

EXT. LAUNDROMAT

Angela exits with her backpack full of laundry, waves
goodbye once more to the Housewife, then rounds a corner
to find Roy waiting for her, out of sight.
ANGELA
Did I do good?
ROY
You did very good.
She leaps in the air.
ANGELA
Mom was wrong: I didn't just get
your elbows.
ROY
One last thing...
Uh-huh?

ANGELA
ROY
Go give her her money back.
What?!

ANGELA
ROY
I told you I'd teach you a con, I
didn't say I'd let you get away
with it.
C'mon!

Now.

ANGELA
You're joking.
ROY
(shakes his head)

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

ANGELA
(can't believe it)
This is so...

Roy points: go. Petulantly, Angela stalks back inside.
Roy watches through a glass wall as she hands the money
back to the Housewife, utterly befuddled.

INT. CAPRICE - DAY

Driving Angela home.
ROY
I have one question for you. And
I want you to think before
answering.
(as she nods okay)
Did you feel better when you took
her money, or when you gave it
back?
(before she answers)
Think first.
Angela thinks.
ANGELA
I thought we were partners.

I'm not your partner.

INT. DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

ROY
And I'm not... scared shitless.
That's good, isn't it?
DR. KLEIN
It's however you feel about it,
Roy.
(MORE)

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

DR. KLEIN (CONT'Dbeat)
Yes. It's wonderful. Don't take
this too literally, but you've
been closing doors for a long
time. It's good to see you start
opening some again.

Roy looks a little worried.
What?

DR. KLEIN
ROY
I -- I took Angela along over the
weekend, selling a piece.
Sometimes in my business you have
to create a value in something
which really isn't there. What
some people call sales, other
people call...
Lying.

DR. KLEIN
ROY
I didn't know how Angela would go
for that. But she took right to
it. She even helped out, this
fourteen-year-old girl, working
these people with me.
DR. KLEIN
Do you regret it? Exposing her to
that? Her seeing that side of
you?
ROY
(moment of truth)
I really liked it. It was the
best time we've had together.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Roy opens his refrigerator door. Inside are greasestained pizza cartons and Chinese food cartons. He
closes it, considers the room around him. It's cluttered
with fashion magazines, empty soda cans, a real mess.
And it's very quiet, for the first time in a while. And
lonely.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

Cans of tuna again. But also some fresh vegetables,
frozen pizzas, and TV dinners.
CHECK-OUT WOMAN
Where's that cute little girl of
yours?
ROY
She went home to her mom's.
Summer school.
CHECK-OUT WOMAN
She's a cute one. Must be
lonesome without her.
Roy considers her as she bags his groceries.
ROY
I'll see you tomorrow.
(hesitates, then)
It's Kathy, right?
(off her nod)
I'm Roy.
Hi, Roy.

KATHY (CHECK-OUT WOMAN)
They shake. Two people meeting after seeing each other
every day for months.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Roy walks through the terminal.

INT. TERMINAL LOUNGE - DAY

Before noon, the place is mostly deserted. One or two
layovers at the bar and a custodian vacuuming the floors.
Roy and Frank case the place. Roy, a standard-sized
black briefcase beside him, withdraws a cigarette; Frank
bums one from him.
FRANK
He said he wants to fly the money
straight to the Caymans. Afraid
he might get robbed.
ROY
As if someone would do that.
When's his flight?

72A.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Friday.

FRANK
(beat)
Where do you think?
Roy points at...
LEATHER BANQUETTE
Roy sits facing the bar, against a wall, the standardsized black briefcase beside him.
ROY
You plant this before the meet.
And keep the table free. I'm
here, you sit him there, back to
the bar. Otherwise we blow it
off.
FRANK
Who's the drunk gonna be?
Ernie.
Typecasting.

ROY
FRANK
ROY
What do you expect for fifty
bucks?
Frank scans the place once more, a little nervous.
FRANK
There's only one problem.
(as Roy waits: what?)
I think I'm in love with you.
Frank lets out a whoop!

He's going to be rich.

SAME SCENE - LATER

Roy stands alone in the middle of the lounge, looking
from table to bar, then to all the walls. Running the
plan over in his head.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
Summer school lets out. Roy scours the young teens
flooding from the school from his Caprice across the
street.

dinner.

ROY
You'll be back by dinner.

She grins even wider.

Roy blanches dramatically:

Uh-oh.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY

Uh-oh was right. Angela lifts a bowling ball up to her
eyes, then lets it rip down an alley -- CRASH!
Meanwhile, Roy cleans his ball meticulously with his
handkerchief -- even the finger holes. It's his turn to
bowl now and, with a swallow for courage, he plunges his
fingers into the ball to pick it up. Angela passes him
on the way back to her seat.
I own you.

ANGELA
Roy glares at her, then steps up to the alley.
Concentrates. Approaches and releases his first roll.
Gutter ball. Keeping his chin high, he retreats to the
ball return.
ANGELA
(approaching
him gently)
Dad. The first thing you have to
understand about this game is:
ninety-percent of it is knocking
down at least one pin.
He grabs at her, and she screams with laughter. And just
then -- BEEP BEEP BEEP -- it's Roy's PAGER going off. He
checks it, sighs.
ANGELA
You want me to bowl for you?
AT PAY PHONE
Roy thinks about wiping the receiver down, but his
handkerchief has already gone dirtier places. Over the
MUSIC and CRASHING PINS, he yells:

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

ROY
It's me, what is it?

What?! I thought it wasn't 'til

Well, tell him --

Roy's face falls. Angela, bowling in the distance, rolls
a strike and leaps in the air.

INT. FRANK'S MUSTANG - DAY

Frank's on a cellular headset, rubbing his temples,
stressed.
FRANK
I know, I know, he bumped it up.
He says he won't be back for a
month.

I don't want to lose him, Roy.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY

Now Roy's stressed, too.
ROY
There's no time. I gotta get the
money, change, get Ernie... What

Roy's face falls. Angela, bowling in the distance, rolls
a strike and leaps in the air.

EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Roy exits, in a rush, and Angela trudges out behind,
pissed.
ROY
I'm sorry. It just came up.

It's okay.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

I can't do this. There's no time.
I can't even take you home.

You want me to take the bus?
No.

ROY
He doesn't know what to do.
Is it a job?

Roy nods.
ANGELA
(timidly)
Can I help?
Roy considers her, thinks, then:
ROY
Yes.

Really?

Roy nods, unhappily.
ANGELA
What do I get to do?
Roy thinks.

Is this the worst idea he's ever had?

Shit!

'Cause it's a secret.

Then why does he get to?
Roy thinks.

To the Clerk:

The Clerk nods, puts forth another form.

Roy opens his deposit box. Inside are bound, neat stacks

INT. TERMINAL LOUNGE

Roy enters, carrying the black briefcase, and immediately
he spots a problem: Frank sits in the banquette seat Roy
should have. Roy continues his approach, clasping his
back now and wincing. Frank and Frechette greet him.
FRANK
Arden, you okay?
My back.

ROY
Strained it last night.

I told you:

FRANK
You should do yoga.

ROY
(a joke)
I was doing yoga. You mind if I
sit there. The high back helps.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Frank and Roy change seats, Roy sneaking a reproachful
glance Frank's way: nice fucking job. As he sits, with
difficulty:
ROY
How are both of you?
Across the lounge, Angela peeks out from behind a
partition to watch Roy, Frank and Chuck. A waitress
delivers Roy a club soda and departs.
So:

Roy and Frechette face off:

Roy lifts his black briefcase onto an empty chair between
them and cracks it open just enough for Frechette to see:
a newspaper. Frechette pries underneath: wall-to-wall
British pounds inside.
FRECHETTE
That's eighty thousand? It looks
like less than I thought.
ROY
It always does.
Frechette reaches in to flip through a stack of bills:
they're all real.
Sorry.

FRECHETTE
Had to check.

ROY
As long as you don't mind.
Roy closes the case and sets it down on the floor by his
feet. Meanwhile, Frechette replaces it with a gym bag.
As he unzips it, Roy steals a glance at the lounge
entrance: Angela is entering.
Go ahead.

FRECHETTE
Do your worst.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Roy explores the gym bag: it's loaded with stacks of
hundred dollar bills.
ROY

You count it?
Frank nods.

A pregnant pause.

Then:

ROY
It looks like we have a trade.

Suddenly, from the bar:
Oh, come on!

Roy peers up and Frank and Frechette turn to look:
Angela is screaming at the lounge bartender.
ANGELA
My I.D. is in my luggage! My
plane doesn't leave for thirty
minutes! Can't I get a goddamn
beer?!
The bartender cautions her and she grabs a tumbler -ANGELA
You touch me, I'll break every
glass in this place.
-- then hurls the GLASS down at the floor, SHATTERING it,
drawing every eye, including Frechette's, and that's when
Roy pulls the switch: the briefcase stowed beneath the
banquette for the identical one by his feet. Lightning
fast.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Hey, you!

ANGELA
Airport bartender!

Angela backs out of the lounge, arms raised, giving the
finger with both hands to the bartender. And she's gone.
Frechette turns back, none the wiser. Frank knows, of
course -- Angela's tantrum was part of the act -- and he
looks at Roy incredulously.
FRECHETTE
Hope she isn't on my flight.
Speaking of which: it's about
that time. Who goes first?
ROY
You do. Just get up and take your
new briefcase with you. When I

That wasn't -ROY

FRANK
They won't let me past the

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

ROY
Then walk him to the security
check.
Frank follows Roy's orders and chases after Frechette.
Roy reaches under the banquette and grabs the briefcase
there. A bag in one hand, the case in the other, he
takes off in the opposite direction.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Roy exits briskly, crossing to the parking garage.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Roy emerges from a stairwell and Angela leaps from behind
a pillar to surprise him.
Boo!

Roy keeps walking, despite a minor cardiac, all business

Do I get a cut?
ROY
You can ask Frank for his.
Roy stops behind a minivan pulling out of a spot, and he
turns to see:
-- the stairwell door fly open and Frechette appear, in a
fury, suitcase open and empty, looking this way and that.
He spots Roy instantly and starts toward him.
Roy punches the gas, around the minivan and away.

Dad?!

ANGELA
(oblivious to
Frechette)
Roy races down levels of parking lot as Frechette chases
on foot. With a fair lead, the Caprice comes to four
gated exit lanes, two cars in the three of them, one car
in the fourth. Roy chooses that one.

Angela does as she's told. His money ready, Roy waits
for the car ahead of him to pass through, but the
ATTENDANT seems to be taking forever to make change.
Meanwhile, the other lanes are clearing up quickly. Roy
considers backing up and choosing another exit, but the
minivan he passed now hovers behind him. He's trapped.
And Frechette appears in his sideview mirror, hustling
toward him. At last, Roy pulls up to the parking

ROY
Please open the gate.

The gate comes up, but too late. Frechette is upon them,
on Angela's side, yanking on the door, rabid.

Roy hits the gas, and the Caprice slaps the gate as it
rises, but before they're clear, Frechette gets a clean
look at Angela hovering below the seat.

EXT. DODGER STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

The Dodgers are away, leaving acres of parking spots
unused. Los Angeles looms in the distance. Frank paces
beside his car and chain smokes as Roy's Caprice pulls

No reply.

Roy just seethes.

Roy gives her the silent treatment a moment, then:

She slams the door behind her. The interior light fades
on Roy. He unwraps the gift shop bag: It's an "I Love

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM

Dark. Roy's on the couch, arm thrown over his eyes.
Hair unkempt, unshaven, wearing clothes for the third day
in a row, the room around him a pigsty. Roy has let the
place and himself go. The PHONE RINGS. And RINGS. And
RINGS. At last, Roy picks it up.
ROY
Hello.
FRANK (V.O.)
You alright?

Roy?
Yeah.

You hungry?

ROY

He discards an empty can of tuna from the couch.

Almost three.

FRANK (V.O.)

He hangs up.

Doesn't move.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN

Also a mess. Roy rinses out a dirty coffee cup. Fills
it with water. Watches it overflow. Reaches up to a
cupboard for his pills. They're not there. Roy furrows
his brow.

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM
Roy looks inside his bedside table.
They're not here either.

Looks around it.

INT. ROY'S BATHROOM

He scours his medicine cabinet, then inspects the waste
basket, looks beneath the sink. The only thing here is
one of Angela's barrettes.

INT. ROY'S HOUSE

He pushes and backtracks through rooms, checking coat
pockets in wardrobes, looking everywhere for his pills as
he speaks on his portable phone:

Roy goes through the trash beneath his sink.

Roy at rock-bottom. He digs though his trash bin, then
upends it. Cans and cans of Chicken-of-the-Sea rattle on

Located in the rear of a discount drugstore. Five people
stand on line for the white-coated, white-haired

wild-haired, impatient.
ROY
C'mon, c'mon.
A few customers look back at Roy. He stares their
glances away. Soon he can wait no longer. He pushes to
the front of the line, empty packet in hand.
ROY
Hi, I need a refill of this. I
don't have a prescription, but -PHARMACIST

Roy stands there, incredulous, infuriated.
In aisle four, he rips open a box of Supplifen to find
the replica of the packet he was given. He crushes it.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM

The place is clean again. Roy opens a Radio Shack box,
pulls out a new portable phone. Reads its instructions.

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM

Roy sits on his bed, phone in hand. Gathering his nerve.
He twirls between his fingers the barrette he found in
his bathroom. At last, he dials. One ring, two rings.

EXT. SAN PEDRO PARK - DAY

Roy sits waiting. Looks up as Angela approaches on her
skateboard. Roy smiles. Angela does not.
SAME SCENE - LATER
They walk along a path.

ROY
I went to see a lawyer. He

parent wants to get joint custody
of the child.

from her)
There are things you have to do.
File paperwork, blood tests, go

Still no reaction.
ROY
I'd have to make some changes.
For one, I'm gonna have to stop
doing what I do for a living.

turns away)
Honey, I'm sorry. I should have

She looks up at him, tears in her eyes, and throws her
arms around him.
Will you try?

Yes.

ANGELA

I'll try, honey.

I'll try.

He wraps his arms around her and holds her.

Roy and Angela celebrate, Angela in a new-bought dress,

A few couples dance. Angela leads a reluctant Roy to the
floor. She holds up her arms for him to take, and he
balks.
Please...

ANGELA
He gives in. Takes her hands in his and, very
tentatively, begins to box-step. Concentrates mostly on
his feet, then remembers to concentrate on Angela. And
she, throughout, just beams.

And suddenly it dawns on Roy, and his eyes drop down to
the coffee table, to the "I Love LA" ashtray atop it.
Angela's gift. Frechette extinguishes his cigarette in
it.
FRECHETTE

Well, once I found you, sniffing

sits huddled, eyes puffed and blackening, nose bloodied,
the crap kicked out of him.

Angela gasps. Frank meets Roy's stare with helpless,
horrified eyes. Roy blanches.
FRECHETTE
You look white as a ghost, Roy. I
don't want you to pass out before
you make your first payment. But
first things first. Let's have
back the money you took from me.
ROY
I don't have it.
FRECHETTE
Then let's start with what you do
have.
Again Roy eyes the gun, his daughter.
ROY
Four thousand. Maybe.
Where?

FRECHETTE
ROY
(staring toward it)
The horse.
No.

FRECHETTE
Let her get it.

Roy stops. Angela looks up at him, frightened. He nods:
it'll be okay. She moves toward the horse. Takes its
head off, starts scooping out money.
FRECHETTE
Next: I'm in for half of what you
make from now on. Otherwise, I
call those cop friends of mine,
your little girl goes to juvie
'til she's eighteen.
I'm out.

ROY
I'm done with this.

FRECHETTE
You're not done, Roy. You barely
got your feet wet. Frank's not
done -- are you, Frank?
Frank doesn't say a word. His eyes are fixed on
something. Frechette follows his stare to -Angela, standing by the horse, Roy's .38 in her hands
leveled at him. Everyone freezes, including Roy.
ROY
Angela, put it down, honey.

I'll

ANGELA

tears in her eyes)
I want you to go.
FRECHETTE
You know how to use that thing,
sweetie?
ROY

Angela doesn't budge.
behind her:
Do it.

Don't make

A standstill.

Then, a small voice

FRANK
ROY
Quiet, Frank.
Frank stumbles to his feet, aching, bloodthirsty.
Frechette, frightened now, moves his hand toward his gun.
Don't.

ANGELA
Frechette stops. Angela looks to Roy. All their dreams
are slipping through their fingers. Roy holds her
glance, apologizing for everything.
Daddy...

ANGELA

Frechette reaches for his GUN again and -- pure reflex -Angela FIRES -- BOOM! -- then drops the .38 to the floor.
Roy turns. Frechette falls off the couch, blood seeping
from his shirt. Shaking, voiceless.
ANGELA
Dad...
Angela trembles, numb.

Roy goes to her.

ROY

Frank:

Frank hobbles over to Frechette.
Daddy...
It's okay.
Roy?
Roy looks over:
too.
Roy?
Roy?

Roy holds Angela.

ANGELA
ROY
It's okay.

FRANK
He's not gonna make it.
Frechette is dying.

Angela sees it,

FRANK
What are we going to do,

Roy's got a lot of thinking to do very fast.

EXT. ROY'S KITCHEN DOOR/DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Frank pulls Chuck's Mercedes up the driveway to the side
door where Roy exits, holding a blanket over Angela's
shoulders. He opens the passenger door for her and she
gets in, nearly catatonic. Roy speaks past her to Frank:
ROY
You know where the Seven Palms
Motel is?
Out the 15?

FRANK
ROY
Get a room. Ground floor if you
have to go out the back. And wait
there for me.

FRANK
Suppose you don't show?
ROY
Take her to her mother's. Then
you drive south and never come
back.
FRANK
What are you going to do?
ROY
(hesitates, then)
Take him to a hospital.

Frank realizes the risk Roy is running.
beside Angela.

Roy kneels

ROY
Angela. Angela? Frank's gonna
get you out of here, and I will
see you in a day or two. It's
gonna be alright, okay?
ANGELA
I... I was trying to...
ROY
I know. Honey, listen to me. You
didn't shoot him. I did.
Understand? I shot him. Right,
Frank?
FRANK
Yes, you did, Roy.
ROY
You just sit tight, honey.
(as this could be
good-bye for a
while)
I'm sorry I let you down.
(to Frank)
Go.
He closes the door. Holds eye contact with Angela as
Frank reverses and carries her away.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN
Roy opens a pantry closet, pulls down some sheets, then
passes into --

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM

-- and his eyes stop at the bloodstain on the carpet.
Frechette is gone. Roy drops the sheets, does a threesixty, looking for places he might have crawled to.
Nothing. He spins -Frechette is leaning against the wall behind him, deathly
pale, blood dripping down his legs. He lifts his gun up
unsteadily, points it between Roy's eyes --- and Roy pivots away just as -BOOM!

HIS POV

An air-conditioner overhead; an I.V. in his arm; an
admission bracelet around his wrist; a uniformed COP
sitting in a chair; a surveillance camera above him.
You awake?

COP
The Cop rises and goes out the door. Roy tries to lift
himself onto one side, can't -- he's handcuffed to a bed
railing. He pokes at a bandage wrapped around his head.
He looks around the room: Spartan, antiseptic, an open
door to a mini-bathroom. He is -IN HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Tiny. One bed, no TV, bars on the windows. The door
opens again, and two detectives (BISHOP and HOLT) come
in, shutting the door behind them.
Morning, Roy.

BISHOP
How d'you feel?

Roy tries to rise again, swoons.
Whoa.

BISHOP
Take it slow.

Who are you?

ROY

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

BISHOP
I'm Detective Bishop, this is
Detective Holt. Doctor'll be in
in a sec.

Roy processes this, feels his bandage again. Bishop
fishes in his jacket, pulls out an evidence bag
containing a bullet fragment.
BISHOP
You were given a pretty close
haircut the other night, Roy.
This little fella took out about
half an inch of your skull.
Bishop offers a couple of head X-rays. Roy can barely
sit up much less study X-rays. Bishop drops them.
BISHOP
You got lucky, Roy. Wish we could
say the same for Chuck.
Roy remembers slowly, wisely keeps his mouth shut.
ROY
Am I under arrest?
BISHOP
(nods)
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say can and
may be used blah blah blah blah...
HOLT
I heard it all.
Roy:
Who?

BISHOP
where's Frank?
ROY

BISHOP
Frank Mercer. Your partner.
We've spent the last couple days
in your home and his. There's not
a lot we don't know.
HOLT
I like your place better.

Clean.

BISHOP
You guys led interesting lives.
In fact, there're some bunko cops
eager to talk to you when we're
done.
(beat)
Where is he, Roy?
Roy shakes his head:

he doesn't know.

BISHOP
Okay. How about this:
Angela?

where's

Roy stonewalls.
BISHOP
She's not at your place, she's not
in San Pedro at, uh -HOLT
(referring to
notepad)

BISHOP
Her mother's near hysterical.
Roy reacts.
ROY
How long have I been here?
(as they don't
respond)
How long?
BISHOP
They brought you in two nights
ago.
Roy thinks, then:

I shot him.

ROY
I shot Chuck.
BISHOP

Why?
ROY
He was gonna shoot me.
BISHOP
He did shoot you.
Before then.

ROY
BISHOP
You're sure about that?
Roy nods.

Bishop and Holt exchange a glance.
BISHOP
That would make our job a lot
easier. Alas, the print we took
off your .38 was a little small.

Where is she, Roy?

Your little girl killed a man,
Roy. That's right. Chuckie
didn't make it.

Holt goes to the window, yanks up the blinds.

Roy winces

Your daughter's wanted for murder.
You're under arrest for accessory.
It's not good, Roy. But it could
still get worse.

Roy's mind races.

ROY
I wanna see my doctor.
HOLT
Like I said, he'll be in in a sec.

ROY
No, my doctor. My shrink. Let me
see him and I'll tell you whatever
you want to know.
Bishop and Holt exchange glances again.
BISHOP
You know where she is?
Roy nods.

Bishop considers it.
BISHOP
What's his number?

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Roy peers through the open blinds as an intern checks his
vitals. From the bed, he can't see anything but a
freeway in the distance. Bishop and Holt return with Dr.
Klein in tow, a little agitated. The intern departs.
Hey, Doc.

ROY
DR. KLEIN
Hello, Roy.
(to Bishop)
May I sit down?
Bishop nods, and Klein takes a seat by the bed.
DR. KLEIN
How are you feeling?
Roy looks.

Bishop, Holt and the cop haven't moved.

ROY
Can we have a little privacy?
BISHOP
That's not how it works, Roy.
ROY
Don't I have doctor-patient rights
or something?
Holt laughs.
DR. KLEIN
Technically, he's right.

BISHOP
Technically, he's not. That
refers to testimony you might give
based on confidential information.
There's no privilege says I gotta
leave you two alone together.
ROY
You do if you want what I know.

They stare each other down.
Five minutes.

Finally, Bishop relents.

BISHOP
They exit.
DR. KLEIN
Roy, what happened? They told
me -Roy holds up his free hand:
gone. After a moment:

Don't speak 'til they're

ROY
There isn't time, Doc.
(beat)
Can I trust you?
DR. KLEIN
Roy -- I can't do anything
illegal.
Roy glances up at the surveillance camera, then covers
his mouth with his free hand, lest any lip readers are
watching.
ROY
Angela's in trouble, Doc. If I
don't help her, she will go to
jail. Please. Help me help her.
Klein looks reluctant.

Roy's eyes plead.

ROY
You got her into this, too -DR. KLEIN
Don't transfer responsibility,
Roy.

ROY
Just make a phone call.
Klein thinks, decides:

okay.

ROY
How are you at memorizing numbers?

My partner will answer the phone.
Ask to speak to Angela.
DR. KLEIN
What do I tell her?
ROY
Tell her -- tell Angela you have

DR. KLEIN
This is what I have to memorize.
ROY
They're going to search you on the

Klein nods:

Roy lies back, exhausted

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Klein hurries to his sedan, fumbling with keys. As he
pulls away, another car follows several seconds behind:
Bishop at the wheel, Holt on the passenger side.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Roy stirs awake, sweating heavily. The air conditioner
is off. The room is dark. The chair where the uniformed
cop sat is empty.
ROY
Hello!
(off no response)
Hey! Officer Maddox!
(off no response)
Could someone turn the A.C. back
on?!
Yo!

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02

Roy reaches for a bedpan on the floor, to throw at the
door, but something rattles within. Roy shakes it again,
then pulls out: a handcuff key. Roy tries it on his
restrained wrist: it's a fit.
He releases himself, checks the door, then pulls his feet
off the bed. For the first time in days, he stands, a
little wobbly, in nothing but a hospital gown.
CLOSE ON ROY
as he quietly cracks open his hospital room door, and his
eyes go wide. Dumbfounded, he moves down a brief hallway,
peers into -ADJOINING ROOM
Empty except for the surveillance monitor propped up on a
chair. Coffee cups and newspapers litter the floor.
Also there: Roy's pants, shirt, jacket and shoes, thrown
in a pile in a corner.
Roy pushes on, through an exit door and steps out onto -168

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DESERTED ROOF - DAY

Blinding sunlight. Roy's hospital room resides within a
mobile construction-site trailer anchored atop the fivestory garage. A freeway passes in the distance.
Roy can't believe it. He staggers around the trailer, to
the roof's edge, and looks down. The parking structure
overlooks a largely-deserted stretch of Los Angeles.
Roy feels his bandage again. Starts to unwrap it. Then
pulls it clean off. Gingerly feels about his skull. No
stitches, no fracture, no bullet hole. Just one mother
of a bruise.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - GROUND LEVEL - DAY

Roy jogs down the bottom ramp, belting his pants, shirt
unbuttoned. He finds a pay phone, but its cord has been
sliced.
VOICE (V.O.over phone)

ROY

How about Mercer? M-E-R...
Bad news.

Roy spots a cab, drops the phone to hail it.

EXT. KLEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Cab waiting, Roy finds the front door locked, finesses it
open. As he enters, he notices Klein's plaque is gone.

INT. KLEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Dark, until Roy turns on an overhead light. The place is
empty. Furniture and fixtures stripped, diplomas off the
wall, cabinets bare. Roy squeezes his eyes shut.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE/INT. CAPRICE - DAY
FROM within the Caprice's window:

Roy arrives in a cab.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Much as he left it. "Blood" stain on the carpet. The
head of the ceramic horse beside it. Roy reaches within,
extracts the only remaining item: a handwritten letter.
FRANK (V.O.)
'Roy: You're probably pretty upset.
I don't blame you. You taught me
most of what I know, so I suppose
I owe you better than this.'

'Enjoy the gift. Frank.'

EXT. UNDER HIGHWAY SIGN

BLASTING UNDER a highway sign:
TO...

"SAN PEDRO," then DOWN

Roy's Caprice, Roy at the wheel. All four windows rolled
down, creating a windstorm inside his car.

EXT. HEATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

For the first time, Roy parks in front of the house. He
staggers to the front door and knocks, running on the
slenderest of hopes.
A moment passes before the door opens, and Heather stands
before him. They share a long moment of recognition.
Roy...

HEATHER
He looks numb, glass-eyed.

He can barely speak.

ROY
She's not here, is she?

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 10/7/02

HEATHER
What?
ROY
Angela?
HEATHER
(at a complete loss)
Who? Roy, what are you talking
about -- ?

Heather is aghast.
HEATHER
That's -- that's why you're here?
ROY
You were pregnant.
She nods.
ROY
You were.
Tears come to her eyes, too, a painful memory.
His last hope dashed, all the revelations of the day come
to a point, and Roy crumbles. He gasps for air, clutches
his gut, and folds into himself.
Roy, Roy:

HEATHER
you okay?

Heather stands helpless before him, then slowly -because of their history, or despite it -- reaches out
and caresses him.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:

EXT. BEHIND CARPETERIA - DAY

Roy on a smoke break.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 10/7/02

His salesman's uniform is not terribly different from his
old costume, and he still wears his hair in a completely
unremarkable fashion, but his bearing has changed: he is
a man at ease. A CO-WORKER sticks his head out the back
door.
Roy:

CO-WORKER
another live one.

Roy nods, flings his cigarette away, returns to work.

INT. CARPETERIA - DAY

Roy finds his next prospect:
flipping through Persians.
Afternoon.

a twenty-year old SLACKER

ROY

SLACKER
(keeps flipping)
How ya doin'.
ROY
Help you with anything?
Yeah.

SLACKER
I need a carpet.

ROY
For your home?
SLACKER
For my secretary's office.

No, it's for my apartment.

ROY
Big place, huh. You have a color

SLACKER
I have a price in mind.

So you don't need much, you don't

price is too low.
SLACKER
That's about me.
ROY
You're my perfect customer.

Let's

SLACKER
Wait, I gotta wait. My girlfriend
knows better than I do what we need.
(off a DOOR CHIME)
That's her.
Roy turns. Angela enters the store. Looking nineteen at
least. Dark glasses and cutoff jeans. She comes
straight at her boyfriend, doesn't notice Roy at all.
ANGELA
What kind of pet store doesn't
carry collars? They've got dog
shampoo in there but no collars.

Roy just stands there.

Studying her.

Making sure he's

SLACKER
Then we'll go to another place.
(to Roy)
We just got a dog.
Let me guess.

ROY
A Lab.

She freezes, recognizing his voice. She won't turn to
face him, while he keeps his eyes locked on her.
Eh.

SLACKER
German shepherd.

ROY
My next guess.
SLACKER
There's no special carpet that
dogs like, is there?
A beat.

Will Roy say something?
ROY
We call it Astroturf. C'mon,
remnants are back of the store.

IN BACK
Roy watches Angela and her boyfriend flip through carpet
fragments. Her attention is obviously divided.
SLACKER
I like that... I like that...
ROY
You folks just move in together?
SLACKER
Three weeks ago.
Big step.

ROY
SLACKER
You think? We only started dating
last month. If you're gonna get
wet -(CONTINUED)

ROY
-- might as well go swimming.
The Slacker laughs: that's what he was going to say.
Angela still won't face him.
SLACKER
Ooh, I really like that one.
ROY
That's a nice choice. Durable. You
barely notice stains it's so dark.
ANGELA
How much is it?
ROY
Sticker's seventy-five. But I can
knock off twenty percent if you
pay cash.
Angela and her boyfriend mull it over, under their breaths,
then agree: it's a sale. Angela dips into her purse...
SLACKER
Our living arrangement. I pay the
rent, she buys all the carpets.
ANGELA
Shit. I think I left my... yeah,
I left my wallet in the car.
(to her boyfriend,
with a big sigh)
Can you get it for me? It
probably just fell under my seat.
He smirks at Roy -- what can he say? -- and heads off.
SLACKER
Be right back.
Roy and Angela watch him go, alone together. She turns
at last to face him. They lock eyes for a moment, then
she indicates the cigarettes in his shirt pocket.
ANGELA
Can I bum one?

EXT. BEHIND CARPETERIA

Roy lights Angela's cigarette, then his own.

ROY
When did you start smoking?
ANGELA
Long time ago. I was stealing
from your pack the whole time.
Surprised you didn't notice.
ROY
I was missing a lot back then.
ANGELA
You like this job?
ROY
(shrugs)
It's not that much different from
the old one really. Steadier.
Only been on it six months.

They smoke in silence.

What to say?

ROY
You working this guy?
ANGELA
Nah. I'm retired. That was a
one-time deal.
No shit.

ROY
You were good.

ANGELA
I had a good teacher.
(sheepishly)
Teachers.
ROY
I'm surprised to see you here.
Figured you would have moved to, I
don't know, Hawaii.
ANGELA
I had bills to pay. My mom was
real sick.
ROY
She get better?
(as Angela shakes
her head)
I'm sorry.

ANGELA
I'm sorry, too. If it's any
consolation. You mad at me?
ROY
You didn't take it.
She takes him in again:

I gave it to you.

the new at-ease Roy.

ANGELA
Things are good with you, aren't they?
SLAM!

Angela's boyfriend exits the back door.
SLACKER
There you are.
ANGELA
Just stealing a drag.
SLACKER
(empty-handed)
I looked everywhere.

She pulls out her wallet.
I found it.

ANGELA
Sorry.

Her boyfriend gives her a look, and Angela gives him a
big kiss for his effort. Roy looks away.

EXT. CARPETERIA - FRONT - DAY

Roy helps the Slacker load and tie his and Angela's new
purchase onto the roof of their aging Honda Civic.
Thanks, man.
Enjoy it.

SLACKER
ROY
The Slacker gets in. For a fleeting moment, Angela and
Roy stand alone again before she gets in the car.
ANGELA
It's good to see you, Roy.
ROY
Good to see you, too.

A beat.

She starts to open the car door, stops.
ANGELA
You're not gonna ask my name?
ROY
I know your name.
ANGELA
(smiles)
I'll see ya, Dad.

Then hops in the car. Roy watches the carpet-loaded
Civic pull creakily away. Looks up at the sun for a
moment before heading back into work.

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

Roy buys ice cream and frozen pizzas.

A young man works

INT. ROY'S CAPRICE -DAY

Driving home. Windows down. Roy keeps just one hand on
the wheel, only bringing the other up for a turn (when we
might notice: he's wearing a ring).

EXT. ROY'S HOME - DAY

Roy pulls his Caprice up the driveway and gets out.
Groceries in hand, he heads to the front door, unlocks
it, enters.
Turning to look inside the house: THROUGH the front
windows, for the first time open and unencumbered by
shades: Roy walks into the living room. A new carpet
replaces the old. He pays it no mind. He leafs through
mail, calls out a name, then turns as --- Kathy enters from the kitchen, wiping her hands clean
on a dishrag. She smiles and Roy smiles, too, explaining
what he got at the market and opening his market bag wide
for her to see. She rubs his head: nice job, then
kisses him, and he kisses back --- and when they break, she whispers sweetly in his ear,
and he smiles even more.
He looks down to lay his palm
gently on her belly. They go into dinner.
FADE OUT.
THE END
