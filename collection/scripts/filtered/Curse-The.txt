EXT. STREET - DUSK

FRIDA and JENNIFER walk down the sidewalk together. Frida is
mousy and frumpy. She wears glasses and has her hair tightly
pulled back into a ponytail. She wears baggy drab clothes --
has no fashion sense and wears flat "sensible" shoes.
Jennifer, on the other hand, is trendy, stylish and sexy.
She's a head-turner. Men check out Jennifer and ignore Frida.

FRIDA
I have cramps. I can't believe I
let you talk me into this.

JENNIFER
Come on, we've been double dating
since the fourth grade.

FRIDA
Yeah even then look what happened:
Michael Mortenson kissed you and
Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.

JENNIFER
Well that's not going to happen
tonight. George said Carlton's a
nice guy.

FRIDA
Translation: a total geek.

JENNIFER
Anything's better than Mark.

FRIDA
My shrink says he's not so bad.

JENNIFER
Your shrink always gives you bad
advice. He only hears what you
choose to tell him. Mark's an
asshole, he cheated, he borrowed
money and never paid it back, he's
never had a regular job.

FRIDA
He's a very talented musician.

JENNIFER
Every woman at some point has to
date a musician. I wish you'd get
rid of Mark for good. Every time
you break up you see him more than
when you were going out.

FRIDA
I guess I have a weakness for him.
It's those big brown Bambi eyes.

JENNIFER
So don't look in his eyes.

Two guys passing by on the street check out Jennifer. One of
them stops in front of her.

GUY
That's the girl who should be
havin' my baby.

JENNIFER
Yeah, that's likely.

She rolls her eyes and walks around the gawking guy. Frida
and Jennifer continue walking in silence for a moment.

FRIDA
I wonder what it's like being you.
Being noticed all the time.

JENNIFER
People notice you Frida.

Another guy gawking at Jennifer, isn't watching where he's
going and bumps smack into Frida.

FRIDA
Oh, uh, sorry.

The guy, still not noticing Frida, keeps walking and turns
back around to check out Jennifer's ass.

Jennifer and Frida turn a corner and keep walking. Both a bit
embarrassed, for different reasons, at what just happened.
They head into a bar/restaurant. Pan up to the name of the
restaurant. It's called "Coyote Ugly Saloon."

INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

Jennifer sits between GEORGE and CARLTON, who both lean in,
hanging on her every word. They're all having steak.

JENNIFER
So I asked the bartender what
"coyote ugly" meant. It's like the
"bagger" system. You know, a two-
bagger -- someone so ugly that you
need two bags -- one bag to put on
their head and another one in case
it blows off. Or a three-bagger...

GEORGE
Two bags for them, and one bag for
your head in case her two fall off.

Jennifer, George and Carlton laugh.

JENNIFER
But coyote ugly... well it's so
totally offensive... it's when a
guy wakes up with a girl sleeping
on his arm. He looks over, and
she's so ugly that he chews through
his own arm to get away from her.

Carlton and George crack up. Too much.

PULL BACK to reveal Frida, also sitting at the table, though a
bit apart from the other three, picking meekly at her salad.
Jennifer looks over and sees Frida's not having a good time.

JENNIFER
Have you heard of that Frida?

Frida looks up from her plate of leaves.

FRIDA
Sorry? I guess I wasn't listening.
I just have really bad PMS.

A total mood killer. Jennifer, George and Carlton just stare
at Frida. Jennifer puts her fork down and clears her throat.

JENNIFER
Uh, Frida... sorry about the steak
house. It's Carlton's favorite.

CARLTON
How come you're a vegetarian?

FRIDA
When I was a kid, we couldn't eat
meat on Fridays. I loved Fridays
because of that. Now I can't stand
the thought of eating bloody flesh.

Jennifer, George and Carlton look down at their rare steaks.

Suddenly they don't look so great.

INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jennifer and Frida are in neighboring stalls. We see only
their feet below the stalls and panties around their ankles.
Jennifer's panties are red lace; Frida's are white cotton.

FRIDA
He hasn't said one word to me.

JENNIFER
Maybe he's just shy.

FRIDA
My date always pays more attention
to you than to me.

JENNIFER
Frida, I don't mean this as a
criticism, but you might not want
to talk about PMS around men.

FRIDA
Sorry. It's just so bad lately.
You're so lucky you never get PMS.

JENNIFER
I get a little bloated sometimes.

FRIDA
I'd kill for just a little bloated.

We hear a toilet FLUSH.

INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

George and Carlton are sitting at the booth, waiting for the
women to return from the bathroom.

GEORGE
It all starts with them going to
the bathroom together.

CARLTON
That many women in one place --
nothing good can come from that.

GEORGE
Sorry about Frida. She's been
friends with Jen forever.

CARLTON
What's with her? If they're not
bleeding they're PMSing. If
they're not PMSing, they're warning
you about the impending doom. If
you're lucky, you get a sane person
one week a month. Then you gotta
date three or four women just to
get some normalcy in your life.

They laugh.

GEORGE
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.

CARLTON
I don't believe in PMS. Women made
it up just so they can be bitchy.

GEORGE
My brother has an answer to PMS.
A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A
man gets sperm build-up, and if his
woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's
gotta get it elsewhere.

CARLTON
Yeah and when your woman says
you're an ass, say yes, I have
Abundant Sperm Syndrome.

They both laugh.

INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jennifer and Frida are now in front of the mirror. Jennifer
fixes her make-up while Frida watches her. ECU of Jennifer
putting lipstick on in slow motion from Frida's POV. Jennifer
smacks her lips in a sexy way when she's done. Frida avoids
looking at herself in the mirror.

FRIDA
I always say the wrong thing. I
shouldn't have come.

Frida catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.

FRIDA
I'm coyote ugly.

Jennifer looks at Frida through the mirror.

JENNIFER
How about I give you a make-over?
You'll feel better about yourself.
You're actually pretty, you're just
not bringing it out.

FRIDA
You're just saying that.

Jennifer squints at Frida for a closer look. She pulls
Frida's hair out of the ponytail and tries to fluff it up.
She takes off Frida's glasses.

JENNIFER
Do you really need these?

FRIDA
Only to see.

JENNIFER
Can't you get contacts?

FRIDA
No, it grosses me out even thinking
of putting something in my eye.

JENNIFER
Try to get through dinner without
them. You have beautiful eyes.

She snaps open Frida's purse and drops the glasses inside.
Frida looks at herself in the mirror. We see her POV and it's
out of focus.

INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

Jennifer and Frida rejoin Carlton and George at the table.
From Frida's POV things look blurry. She stumbles as she sits
down. She squints, hoping things will come back in focus.

CARLTON
You two must be in sync.

JENNIFER
Excuse me?

GEORGE
He was saying that when women are
close friends they get their
periods at the same time.

JENNIFER
(sarcastically)
Yeah and when we're mad at each
other we're out of sync. It only
works if you're on good terms.

FRIDA
Or if there's a full moon.

JENNIFER
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.

She elbows George in the stomach. Frida tries to take a sip
from her drink, but because she can't see well she knocks it
over. Everyone stands up and it's a huge ordeal.

FRIDA
I'm so sorry! I'm such a clutz.

She fishes in her purse for her glasses and puts them on as
Jennifer helps her wipe up the spilled drink.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Frida's apartment is neat and conservatively decorated. She's
got some film posters on the wall.

Frida, in a big puffy bathrobe with bearclaw slippers, lounges
on her sofa. Sammy, a black cat, sits on her lap purring as
Frida reads a script. She nibbles on a chocolate bar. From
the way Frida shakes her head and flips through the pages of
the script, we can tell it's awful.

INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits at a claustrophobic cubicle. There's a small stack
of screenplays sitting in front of her. Frida's on the phone.

FRIDA
Yes, I do think it's important to
tell the Mother Teresa story... but
no way can I pitch that to my boss.

MAN (ON PHONE)
Why the hell not?

FRIDA
It won't get the ratings. He only
wants "women in jeopardy" stories.

MAN (ON PHONE)
How about if Mother Teresa's being
stalked by the Pope?

FRIDA
Only if Jane Seymour plays Mother
Teresa and Richard Chamberlain
plays the Pope. It's just not for
us. I'm sorry. Good luck with it.

Frida hears the phone slam down and a dialtone. She hangs up
just as her boss, MR. GRANT, barges in and barks at her.

MR. GRANT
The Nielson's?

FRIDA
On your desk.

MR. GRANT
Script coverage?

FRIDA
On your desk.

MR. GRANT
Coffee and...

FRIDA
Your desk.

Mr. Grant abruptly turns and heads back into his office.

FRIDA
There was a script I wanted to talk
to you about... I thought maybe...

She gets up with a script. As she does, she spills her coffee
all over the desk.

FRIDA
... I could produce it.

Mr. Grant ignores her and slams the door to his office. Frida
wipes up the spilled coffee with the script.

INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida's at her SHRINK's office.

FRIDA
I had a dream last night, that I
was a doormat.

CUT TO:

EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

Frida lies on her back outside the front door of a house, like
a welcome mat. People walk over her. We see from her POV:
people stepping over her and wiping their shoes on her.

BACK TO SHRINK'S OFFICE

The shrink makes a note.

SHRINK
And what do you think this means?

Frida stares at the shrink for a second, surprised he doesn't
get such an obvious reference.

FRIDA
That I'm a doormat of course.
The shrink makes more notes.

SHRINK
Oh, I see... interesting theory.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Jennifer and Frida sit on a bench surrounded by shopping bags.

JENNIFER
Okay, just one more stop and you'll
be all set. Victoria's Secret.

FRIDA
What do I need overpriced fancy
underwear for? Shouldn't a guy
have already decided that he likes
me before he sees me in lingerie?

JENNIFER
It's not about him seeing you in
it. It's how you feel. You'll
feel sexy in lingerie and it'll
show. It's an inner thing.

FRIDA
I don't know.

JENNIFER
There's a sale. It's such a nice
place -- classical music, relaxing
atmosphere. You deserve to pamper
yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.

INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY

Chaos. Hardly the "relaxed atmosphere" Jennifer described.
Though there is indeed classical music playing.

CUT TO an overhead shot of a huge circular bin of women's
underpants and another bin of bras. All different colors.

Various women's hands pick frantically through the bins,
looking for the right size and color. Sometimes hands grab at
the same one simultaneously. The atmosphere seems hectic.

WOMAN 1
Give me that. You ain't a D cup.

WOMAN 2
If you're a D cup, I'm Pamela
Anderson.

WOMAN 3
Is that a medium?

WOMAN 1
Why do they have large thongs?
Anyone in a large ain't gonna be
wearin' no thong.

FRIDA
Where are all the mediums?

JENNIFER
Frida, grab that red one.

Jennifer's finger points to a red panty and Frida snatches it
and gives it to her.

WOMAN 2
Large, small. No fucking mediums.

More and more hands pick through the bras and panties, with
increasing fervor. Frida's hand grabs a pair of blue panties.

FRIDA
Jennifer, I got a medium!

As Frida pulls the pair of panties out of the pile, she
realizes an OLIVE-SKINNED WOMAN is grabbing the other end of
the panties. They have a bit of a tug of war over it.

OLIVE WOMAN
That's mine!

FRIDA
No I had it first.

The tug of war continues. Frida and the Olive Woman both
refuse to let go. It looks like they're about to rip when the
Olive Woman's head comes into frame -- the back of her head
fills the frame with brunette curls. Frida screams.

FRIDA
OUCH!

EXT. STREET - DAY

Frida and Jennifer walk down the sidewalk with Victoria's
Secret shopping bags among others.

FRIDA
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?

JENNIFER
And she got the medium.

FRIDA
Even on sale that stuff's a
fortune. I worked all week to pay
for a bra.

Frida looks at her wrist, which is beginning to swell.

FRIDA
I think she broke the skin.

JENNIFER
What a bitch. You should see a
doctor. That can be dangerous.
George bit me once and I had to go
to the emergency room.

FRIDA
George bit you?

JENNIFER
I kind of asked him to. We were,
you know... he got a little carried
away...

Frida looks at Jennifer uncomfortably. Jennifer smiles to
herself, reminiscing.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits, wearing a white hospital gown, on an examining
table. She's bored as there isn't much to look at and it's
cold in there -- especially in the skimpy gown.

She goes to a mirror and puts on chapstick. She smacks her
lips as Jennifer had in after putting on lipstick.

Suddenly the door opens and nearly hits her. Frida backs up,
embarrassed, as a male DOCTOR in a white coat walks in. He
barely looks at Frida and stares at his clipboard.

DOCTOR
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?

FRIDA
At Victoria's Secret.

The doctor looks up from his clipboard, confused.

FRIDA
There was a sale.

DOCTOR
I mean where on your body?

FRIDA
Oh, on my wrist.

She holds it up for him to see. He takes a look at it.

DOCTOR
A dog at Victoria's Secret?

FRIDA
No, it was another woman.

The doctor seems skeptical. He examines her wrist closer.

DOCTOR
This doesn't look human. Did she
wear dentures or... damn this is
the oddest bite I've ever seen.

The doctor makes a note on his clipboard.

DOCTOR
How's the rest of your health?

FRIDA
Good. Except for PMS.

The doctor resists the temptation to roll his eyes.

DOCTOR
PMS. What symptoms are you
experiencing?

FRIDA
It's hard to describe. I get
really bloated and irritable and
emotional and depressed and...

DOCTOR
That's just part of being a woman.
Diet and exercise should help.
Avoid salt, sugar, starches,
caffeine, alcohol...

FRIDA
What else is there?

DOCTOR
And keep a journal of your symptoms
to make sure it's related to your
period and not just in your head.

FRIDA
It's not just in my head.

The doctor snaps his folder shut and heads for the door.

DOCTOR
I'll send a nurse in to clean that
bite and give you a tetanus shot.
And a rabies shot... just in case.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Frida chomps on a carrot. She presses PLAY on her answering
machine and picks up a framed picture of herself and MARK.
They're both smiling. Frida puts the picture back, face down.

FRIDA'S MOM (ON MACHINE)
It's mom. I ran into Herman today.
I wish you'd move back home and
marry him. He's got a great job at
Penneys. I don't know why you're
in New York with all those freaks.

Sammy, the black cat, whizzes by with his tail puffed.

Frida enters the kitchen and sees the cat's dishes are empty.
She gets a cat food can out of the cupboard and accidentally
scratches herself. She notices her nails are surprisingly
long. She stares at them, confused, then opens the cat food.

FRIDA
Sammy? Seafood Feast?

Frida sniffs the cat food as though it smells good to her.
She nearly eats some -- then shakes her head, realizing it was
a crazy thought. She stands up and sniffs around her kitchen.

She searches the cupboards. Then the refrigerator. It's full
of fruit and vegetables. The other cupboard has healthy stuff
as well. Frida slams the cupboard shut. Obviously not
finding what she's looking for.

A MONTAGE with jump cuts as Frida paces in circles. She clips
her fingernails and toenails, which are quite long and thick.

She goes to the refrigerator, opens the door, looks in and
closes the door. She does this several times as if its
contents will change the next time she opens it.

She paces faster and faster in a tighter circle. She feels
claustrophobic in her clothes and practically rips them off.

INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Frida hurriedly shoves several chocolate bars in her basket,
which is filled with junk food (frozen yogurt, chocolate-
covered pretzels, Doritos), a box of tampons, and some Midol.

Frida senses someone watching her as she grabs a bag of
Hershey's kisses. She looks up and sees BRUNO, an intriguing-
looking man. They make eye-contact and he smiles at her.
Frida is nervous but flattered. She heads for the cashier.

EXT. GROCERY STORE/STREET - NIGHT

We see Frida walking from behind. We're in the POV of someone
who's following her. Then CU Frida as she continues walking,
holding her grocery bags. She senses someone following her
and spins around to look.

She sees Bruno walking behind her. She smiles a tad and then
turns back around and keeps walking. She hears Bruno's pace
quicken and she quickens her own.

We see Frida from Bruno's POV as he speeds up and is gaining
on her. What started out as a briefly sexy moment has
suddenly become kind of scary. CU on Frida walking fast. We
hear her heart beating fast. Bruno catches up to her -- he's
right behind her. Frida can hear him breathing hard.

Frida spins around and stares at Bruno. Her normally blue
yes look oddly bright -- like they're orange. She swipes at
the Bruno's face with her fingernails and slashes him. He
jumps back in pain and covers his face.

BRUNO
Jesus Christ!

He pulls his hand from his face to reveal large bloody
scratches on his cheek. He looks up at Frida, but she's gone.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Frida, in her bathrobe, is downing chocolate bars rabidly.
Her cat, Sammy, is hiding, frightened under the bed.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Frida's asleep on the sofa with her bathrobe draped over her.
She wakes up slowly, in a daze, like she has a bad hang-over.

She looks around, squinting -- the light hurts her eyes. Her
apartment's in disarray -- furniture moved around. She sits
up and puts her bathrobe on, realizing it's ripped.

FRIDA
Sammy?

Frida gets up and notices the cat food dish is empty. She
opens a can of cat food. The cat's nowhere to be seen.

INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Frida looks in the mirror. She examines her arms and legs and
thinks they look hairy. They look fine, but she's obsessed.
She has a quick flash in which they look hairier, but then
they're normal again. Is it all in her head?

Frida leans closer to the mirror and scrutinizes her face and
"mustache" area. She then opens the medicine cabinet and
finds some Neet liquid hair remover and turns on the shower.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DAY

Frida takes a brand new bra out of her Victoria's Secret
shopping bag. She puts on the bra -- it's clearly too tight.
She adjusts the straps to no avail -- she's still bulging out.
She pulls on a shirt and blazer.

Frida grabs her coat and briefcase and leaves. As soon as she
shuts the door, the cat comes out and goes to its food dish.

EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

Frida sits in the sunshine eating chocolate pudding like
there's no tomorrow as she reads a script. She wears tennis
shoes with her suit. She feels a little hot and unbuttons the
top few buttons of her blouse.

GREGORY, a tall, good-looking guy in a suit, stands casting
his shadow on her. Frida is startled for a moment. She looks
up at him looming over her, but he's hard to see since the sun
is right behind him.

GREGORY
Didn't mean to scare ya. It's
Frida, right? I'm Gregory. From
accounting.

Frida's a little uneasy about him staring at her chest.

FRIDA
I know.

GREGORY
So you're Grant's secretary?

FRIDA
I do development for TV movies.

GREGORY
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a
really great idea for a screenplay.

Frida tries to avoid cringing.

FRIDA
(slightly sarcastic)
You're kidding, really?

GREGORY
No, I'm serious. How about we have
dinner and I tell you about it?

EXT. POLICE BUILDING - DAY

Two male police detectives, PETER and LLOYD, are getting out
of an unmarked car.

LLOYD
Nah, I don't wanna break up with
Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.

PETER
Man, you're livin' dangerously.
Let me ask you somethin', you
always have to get women drunk
before they'll sleep with you?

LLOYD
You kiddin'? They try to get ME
drunk.

PETER
You're some catch Lloyd.

LLOYD
Hey, you hear about the chick that
came in today? Said some chick bit
her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches
are outta control these days.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida, in her ripped bathrobe, is setting up her new makeup on
a table. She hears a knock on the door and heads for it.

FRIDA
Jennifer, you're early...

She opens the door and sees MARK, the guy from the photo she'd
put face down. Mark is cute, but a bit of a geek. He does
have the nice brown eyes Frida mentioned earlier. He carries
a McDonald's bag and is eating a French fry.

FRIDA
What are you doing here Mark?

He pushes his way past her and into the apartment.

MARK
I missed you. I wanted to see you.

Frida's skeptical.

MARK
Hey what's all this stuff?

He shoves aside some of the makeup and puts down his
McDonald's bag on the table.

FRIDA
Jennifer's giving me a makeover.

Mark takes a burger out of the bag and unwraps it. Frida
sniffs at the burger.

MARK
What, you got a date or somethin'?

FRIDA
Since when do you care?

Frida lustily eyes the burger. Mark sees her check it out.

MARK
Sorry, I know you hate the sight of
meat.

Mark looks at Frida for a moment -- for the first time really
since he barged in.

MARK
You look different. I mean you
look good.

FRIDA
You never say that.

MARK
You do though. You look really...
is that a wonderbra?

FRIDA
No.

He walks closer to her. Frida backs up.

Mark moves in closer, puts his arms around her and tries to
kiss her. Frida turns her head away from his kiss. She looks
down and sees the burger, which sits on the table behind Mark.

ECU of the burger looking delicious like in a commercial.

Frida sniffs and makes a little moan -- she's completely
focused on the burger. Mark thinks she's moaning for him, and
he continues kissing her neck. As he does, Frida reaches
down, picks up the burger and takes a huge bite out of it.

CLOSE ON Frida's face as we see her sheer near-orgasmic
enjoyment of the burger. Suddenly Mark jerks away.

MARK
OUCH! Shit! What the fuck?

He twists his arm to reach around to feel his back.
Completely ignoring Mark's pain, Frida takes a few more chomps
of the burger as though she hasn't eaten in days.

Mark lifts his shirt, which is ripped. He sees in the mirror
that his back has huge bleeding scratches on it.

MARK
Look what you did!

FRIDA
Oh my god, I'm sorry!

MARK
Shit. And you're eating my burger?
You don't eat meat.

FRIDA
I can't help it, it smells so good.

Frida finishes the burger with an enormous bite and then runs
into the bathroom and gets rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.

MARK
Fuck you have sharp nails.

Frida dabs his scratches with the rubbing alcohol.

MARK
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I
going to do with my back like this?

FRIDA
Worried about what all your
girlfriends might think?

MARK
Frida, you know you're it for me.

FRIDA
Yeah right... You better go.

Frida pulls him towards the door. Mark grabs his empty burger
wrapper and fries.

MARK
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for
that burger. You owe me...

FRIDA
You haven't even paid me back the
thousand bucks you owe me!

MARK
I'm working on it...

Frida rolls her eyes. She drags him and pushes him out the
door. Mark's surprised by how strong Frida is.

Frida slams the door and locks it.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - LATER

ECUs of Jennifer putting make-up on Frida.

FRIDA
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean
he's cute -- he probably just wants
to pitch his screenplay idea.

JENNIFER
Maybe he likes you, ever think of
that? It's good for you to go out
-- get your mind off Mark.

FRIDA
You're so lucky you have George and
don't need to go on dates anymore.

JENNIFER
What I really hated about dating
was the lines guys used to get into
my apartment. "Can I use your
phone?" "How about a nightcap?"
"I want to meet your cat." And my
all-time favorite, the old standby,
"I have to use your bathroom."

FRIDA
Maybe they have to pee.

JENNIFER
Are you kidding? He might as well
say, "Can I date rape you?"

FRIDA
I never thought of it like that. I
never know what to do on dates. Do
guys still pay?

JENNIFER
They better. Of course, trouble
is, you never know what they'll
expect for it. You gotta know what
to order, and what you're willing
to do. Like if a guy spends a
fortune on you, he's gonna feel
like you owe him something.

Frida looks worried. She picks up a big hand mirror on the
table and looks at herself.

FRIDA
Oh my god, I have a mustache!

Jennifer looks closely at Frida's face.

JENNIFER
Where?

FRIDA
Where? Where do you think a
mustache would be. Look!

JENNIFER
I don't see anything. Maybe just a
little.

FRIDA
Holy shit, I'm a freak.

JENNIFER
You are not Frida, we all have a
little hair there. I didn't even
notice till you showed me. We can
bleach that, it's no big deal.

Jennifer brushes Frida's hair. She pauses and looks at
Frida's eyes.

JENNIFER
Hey, did you get contacts?

FRIDA
(suddenly realizing she's not
wearing glasses)
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got
stronger from not wearing them.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Frida sits across the table from Gregory.

GREGORY
You hungry?

FRIDA
Starving.

A waiter hands each of them a menu.

GREGORY
Have whatever you want. My treat.

They each look at menus. The entrees are listed from lighter
fair down to steaks. CU of each menu item and its price.
Frida does a double-take at her menu.

Instead of seeing a dollar amount, Frida reads it like this,
"Chef's Salad = French Kissing and Groping; Pasta Special =
Heavy Petting and Breast Feel; Chicken Marsala = Blow Job;
Steak Frites = Regular Fucking; Surf and Turf Lobster = Kinky
Sex till you're sore."

GREGORY
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll
go for the Surf and Turf.

FRIDA
I'm not really hungry after all.

GREGORY
You said you're starving. Come on,
I can't stand a woman who won't
eat.

Frida hungrily eyes a steak the waiter passes by with. She
inhales deeply.

FRIDA
Maybe just one little steak...

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

CU of Frida eating. Devouring everything on her plate. Slow
DOLLY IN to CU of Frida as Gregory goes on about himself.

GREGORY
My senior year, I was waiting for
that letter from Harvard. I'd
heard from Yale. Got in. Brown,
MIT, got in. But Harvard... here's
the suspense... a letter comes...
And everyone knows if it's a thin
envelope you don't get in, right?
So I get a thin envelope and I
wasn't even gonna open it. I was
just gonna jump off a bridge.
Cause it was Harvard or bust...

Frida looks up momentarily as she rips off a particularly
tough piece of meat. Her food is much more interesting than
her date. Gregory blurs a bit into the background. His voice
is slightly altered -- as now we're hearing his subtext.

GREGORY
Okay let's face it, I got into
Harvard cause my dad donated
$50,000. I barely got a thousand
on my SATs and was kicked outta
prep school, but hey, that's life.
I have a really small penis. Which
is why I tell stories about how
great I am. I'm also losing my
hair and I have no interest in a
relationship. I just want you to
like my screenplay idea but I do
expect you to fuck me later...

The camera's still on Frida as she's eating. She looks up at
Gregory again momentarily as he snaps back into focus.

GREGORY
So there I was, hanging from the
edge of a bridge, when my mom said,
"Son, you got into Harvard!" It
took three of them to pull me back!
Frida keeps eating.

GREGORY
Well, whattdaya think?

FRIDA
That's great. Highly original.

Frida cleans her plate with her finger and licks it. Gregory
stares at her. He's only half finished -- he's been busy
talking, and she's been busy eating. Frida eyes his half-
eaten steak and points at it with her fork.

FRIDA
Are you gonna finish that?

EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Gregory is walking Frida home. She gets her keys out.

FRIDA
I'd really feel more comfortable
paying for my half of the dinner.

GREGORY
Hey, how about a little nightcap?

He leans against the door, blocking Frida as she tries to
unlock the door.

FRIDA
I'm really tired.

GREGORY
Come on, didn't all that steak make
you thirsty?

FRIDA
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel
well. I've got terrible PMS.

GREGORY
They say sex is great for cramps.

FRIDA
Well I have it worse than cramps.
Goodnight Gregory.

She tries to push him aside from the door. He doesn't budge.
In fact he leans closer to Frida. She can feel his breath.

GREGORY
Can I use your bathroom?

Frida spins around.

FRIDA
What?

GREGORY
I really gotta pee.

FRIDA
You should have gone at the
restaurant.

GREGORY
I didn't have to pee then.

FRIDA
My apartment's just such a mess.

GREGORY
That's okay. I just have to use
the bathroom and then I'll leave.

FRIDA
Oh come on. Knock it off.

GREGORY
Knock what off?

FRIDA
You don't have to pee.

GREGORY
Yes I do have to pee!

FRIDA
You're just saying that to get into
my apartment and then you're hoping
that'll turn into something else.

GREGORY
I wouldn't mind doin' something
else, but I do really have to pee.

FRIDA
Uh huh. So pee.

GREGORY
So pee? Here?

FRIDA
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to
see it -- that's what this is all
about, right?

Gregory looks at her, not sure if she's serious. Then he
takes a step back and looks around to make sure no one's
watching. He then unzips his pants and pees. Frida has the
urge to laugh for a moment, but then she holds it back.

An awkward moment as Gregory takes a really long time to pee.
He looks over at Frida once or twice, and they exchange an
awkward glance. Finally he's done and he zips up his pants.

Frida and Gregory look at each other. Frida's eyes seem to
glow. She takes a step towards him. Gregory's taken off
guard as Frida grabs him and kisses him.

FADE TO WHITE and dissolve into next scene.

EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Dissolve down from a bright morning sky and then dolly in
quietly on the building.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING	31

Move in slowly on a CU of Frida sleeping. She wakes up and
squirms around a little. She notices a bloody handprint on
her pillowcase and jolts awake. She bolts up and sees blood
on her hand. She quickly pushes her sheets down and sees more
blood on her white sheets and on her legs. She sighs,
realizing she's gotten her period.

FRIDA
Thank god.

Frida looks around and squints. Her vision's blurry. She
grabs her glasses and puts them on. She sees Sammy curled up
at the foot of her bed, purring. She pets him.

FRIDA
Even you know when PMS is over.

EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Frida and Jennifer are each holding laundry baskets full of
laundry. Frida is juggling trying to lock her door while
balancing her basket on her leg.

FRIDA
It was like I woke up in a murder
scene. It took me a few seconds to
realize it was just my period. I
must have had a bad dream.

Peter and Lloyd are at the end of the hallway looking at Frida
and Jennifer, but the women don't notice them.

PETER
We're looking for Frida Harris.

Frida and Jennifer turn and see Peter and Lloyd approaching.

FRIDA
I'm Frida Harris.

Her eyes lock with Peter's. There's some attraction there,
but we don't dwell on the moment too long. LLoyd is in no way
subtle checking out both women.

PETER
We're police detectives.

Frida feels guilty. She's not sure why. Maybe just cause
she's Catholic.

LLOYD
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.

FRIDA
Oh my god, what happened?

PETER
He was found a few blocks away.

LLOYD
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A
bloody gruesome mess.

Frida looks down at her laundry and sees the bloody sheet on
the top. Peter and LLoyd look down and see it too.

FRIDA
I had a little accident.

Jennifer sees Frida is embarrassed. Both men stare at her
bloody sheet. Lloyd clears his throat.

JENNIFER
Jesus Christ she got her period.
Relax guys. It happens.

PETER
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's
roommate told us you were out with
him last night.

FRIDA
Yes... I... we had dinner.

LLOYD
Did he come home with you? Did you
go to his apartment?

FRIDA
No, it was our first date.

LLOYD
Looks like it was your only date.
Unless you go to his funeral.

Lloyd chuckles. Peter shoots him a look.

PETER
When's the last time you saw him?

FRIDA
We... he walked me home and... we
said goodnight. Um, he kissed me
goodnight and that was it.

LLOYD
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?

FRIDA
No, I said it was our first date.

JENNIFER
How the hell is that your business?

PETER
We're just trying to figure out
what happened.

FRIDA
I wish I could help but last I saw
Gregory was outside my front door.

PETER
Okay, if you think of anything
else, please give us a call.

Peter tries to hand Frida a business card, but she has no
hands free so he puts it on her bloody sheet. Lloyd can't
keep his eyes off the bloody sheet.

LLOYD
Uh... mind if we take those sheets
in for testing? You know, to rule
everything out.

Frida turns red.

JENNIFER
You want her sheets?

PETER
We can just take this pillowcase.

LLOYD
We can get a warrant if you like.

FRIDA
No, take it.

Peter slips on a glove and picks up the pillowcase with the
bloody handprint on it. He's nearly as embarrassed as Frida.
Their eyes lock for a moment, then they both avert their gazes.

PETER
Sorry.

INT. LAUNDROMAT - MORNING

Frida and Jennifer are taking their clothes out of dryers.

FRIDA
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?

JENNIFER
There you go, blaming yourself for
everything again.

FRIDA
And he was ripped limb from limb?

JENNIFER
I'm sure they were exaggerating.

FRIDA
Why would they exaggerate?

JENNIFER
To sound like big macho cops. He
was probably just found with a
knife in his back.

Jennifer looks up at Frida, who looks overwhelmed.

JENNIFER
So did you do it?

FRIDA
Did I kill him? Of course not!

JENNIFER
No, did you fuck him?

FRIDA
No. I don't think so.

JENNIFER
You don't think so? You either did
or your didn't.

FRIDA
I don't remember. We kissed at my
door and next thing I knew I woke
up with my period. Alone.

JENNIFER
Did you get smashed or what? You
have to eat if you're drinking.
And not just those little salads.

FRIDA
I ate a burger in the afternoon and
a steak and a half with Gregory.

JENNIFER
I guess you're off that vegetarian
kick you've been on for ten years.

FRIDA
I couldn't stop eating steak. I
felt out of control -- like I was
making up for all those years being
a vegetarian. I couldn't get
enough. And then Gregory walked me
home... and he peed in front of me.

JENNIFER
What? Why the hell did he do that?

FRIDA
He was trying to get into my
apartment and... I know this sounds
gross but I was so turned on. I
grabbed him and kissed him!

JENNIFER
And then?

FRIDA
I think I went in and fell asleep.
I guess Gregory walked home and got
killed! I blacked out.

JENNIFER
At least your PMS is over.

FRIDA
And my bra finally fits again.

Jennifer folds some of George's boxer shorts.

JENNIFER
I thought you were going to stop
wearing your glasses.

FRIDA
My vision got worse again.

Frida pulls out a pair of men's briefs from the dryer.
Jennifer eyes them suspiciously.

JENNIFER
Are those Mark's?

FRIDA
No, Mark wears boxers. They must
have been in the dryer already.

JENNIFER
Uh huh... good thing those cops
didn't see that.

Frida picks up Peter's card.

FRIDA
He was cute, huh? Of course
whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing
no make-up.

JENNIFER
Rule one: always wear make-up.

FRIDA
I wonder if he's married.

JENNIFER
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you
don't want to date a cop Frida.
They're so blue collar.

Frida leaves the briefs on the laundry table. She notices
they're ripped.

INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY

Peter and Lloyd are going over some papers.

LLOYD
I didn't trust her. All that blood
on the sheets. She may look sweet,
but she could be a wolf in sheep's
clothing. Something's weird.

PETER
That dude was torn limb from limb.
No way a woman like that could have
done it. You never seen blood on a
chick's sheets from her period?

LLOYD
Hell no, I'm not into that shit.
The sight of blood makes me sick.

PETER
Oh, so you decide to be a cop?
Seriously? You don't have sex with
a woman cause she's on the rag?

LLOYD
No man. Blood is not a turn on.
You sure let that Frida off the
hook. You weren't even going to
take the sheets. If I didn't know
better, I'd think you liked her.

PETER
I can tell she's not a killer. You
just don't like her cause you have
a hang up about menstruation.

LLOYD
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you
should never date a woman who was
the last one to see a guy alive.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer is giving Frida a manicure. She's filing her nails.

JENNIFER
Your nails are so tough and pointy.
What is this stuff under them?

Jennifer scrapes what looks like flesh from under her nails.
The phone rings.

FRIDA
Ignore it. It's probably my mom.

The machine picks up.

FRIDA (ON MACHINE)
Hi it's Frida. Leave a message!

The machine beeps.

MARK (ON MACHINE)
Frida, Frida, Frida. I get so hot
thinking about yesterday. My
scratches have almost healed and
I'm ready for more.

Jennifer freezes.

JENNIFER
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh?
When did you see him?

FRIDA
Um, he stopped by yesterday before
you came over.

JENNIFER
Why didn't you tell me? You said
you hadn't seen him for a month.

FRIDA
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to
think I was still a doormat.

JENNIFER
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not
judging you... You didn't sleep
with the creep did you?

INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits at her desk typing at her computer. A larger stack
of scripts sits beside her. Mr. Grant walks by and plops
several more on her desk. Frida's looking buried in scripts.

MR. GRANT
Find me that "Woman in Jeopardy"
story.

He starts to pass by as usual, then stops, stares at Frida,
looking her up and down. He's noticed something has changed.

FRIDA
How about a "Man in Jeopardy"
story?

MR. GRANT
Did you change your hair?

FRIDA
A little.

Mr. Grant nods and continues on his way. Frida gives him the
look of death.

INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sitting at her shrink's office.

FRIDA
I had the strangest dream -- that I
was really hungry, and I was
chasing someone... I think I was
some sort of animal. And my sex
drive... it's embarrassing but I've
had these sexual dreams too.

The shrink leans forward eagerly.

SHRINK
Anything about bestiality?

Frida looks back at him quizzically.

FRIDA
What's that?

EXT. STREET - DAY

Peter and Lloyd are walking. Peter's reading a lab report.

LLOYD
Frida's sheets checked out fine.
It was just her own blood. From
her... you know.

PETER
I told you she was innocent.

LLOYD
Hey, there was a lot of blood.

PETER
She was never a suspect Lloyd.
Some animal must have done this.

LLOYD
I checked all the zoos. No missing
animals. You think a pitbull?

PETER
Maybe. What about all those hairs
they found on his body?

LLOYD
Waiting for DNA tests. He was
hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

PETER
Madonna's in Penthouse?

LLOYD
Back in the '80's. You didn't see
the pictures? They were from
before she got famous. She was
hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.

PETER
Hairy women are kind of sexy.
Women in their natural state.

Lloyd gives Peter a grossed out, horrified look.

PETER
What?

LLOYD
And you think I'm sick?

INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits at her desk, typing a letter. We hear a VOICE OVER
of what she's typing.

FRIDA (V.O.)
Thank you for your submission of
"Woman on the Tracks." Although
the story of a woman being rescued
by Fabio after being tied to the
train tracks is indeed the kind of
lame ass "Women in Jeopardy" genre
that my company seeks, I cannot of
sound mind pass this script on to
anyone. In a nutshell: it sucks.

Mr. Grant walks by and dumps a few scripts on Frida's desk.

FRIDA
Wait. Mr. Grant.

He keeps walking. Frida rises and speaks with more authority.

FRIDA
Mr. Grant.

He stops in his tracks, surprised at her tone. He turns
around slowly.

FRIDA
I can't read any more crap. These
women are all victims.

MR. GRANT
Yes, that's what we're looking for.

FRIDA
I think we should do something with
strong female characters...

MR. GRANT
I'll make a note of that. Put the
coverage on my desk.

Mr. Grant walks into his office. Frida sits down, satisfied
and surprised she had the nerve to speak to him like that.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits across from her doctor as he examines her wrist.

DOCTOR
That bite healed up quickly. It's
been about three weeks?

FRIDA
Nearly four.

DOCTOR
How have you been feeling?

FRIDA
Okay, but I'm worried about the
next PMS bout. It's gotten worse.
I'm not myself during it. I get
bloated, irritable, my breasts get
huge, my nails turn into claws, my
teeth get sharper and I have more
facial and body hair.

DOCTOR
Sounds all stress related. Your
teeth may feel sharper if you're
grinding them at night. You don't
seem hairy to me. Is that all?

FRIDA
I get crazy dreams and I black out.

DOCTOR
Diet and exercise, that's all there
is. I'm not a big proponent of the
PMS craze, but there's a book my
wife mentioned called "The PMS
Diet," which may be helpful.

FRIDA
Does she have PMS?

DOCTOR
Now it's menopause. She's always
hot. I gotta wear a parka around
the house cause she keeps it so
cold. It's always something.

MONTAGE

of Frida dieting and exercising -- eating carrots and salads.
Working out at a gym. Sometimes with Jennifer. Jogging.
Showing a passage of time and Frida trying to overcome PMS.

EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

Peter, wearing a "University of Michigan" T-shirt, is standing
across the street from the bookstore. Frida walks out of the
bookstore with a shopping bag and heads down the sidewalk.
Peter follows her.

Frida keeps walking but senses someone's following her. She
turns around quickly and sees Peter duck behind a corner. She
thinks about this for a second and then turns around and heads
for him. Peter realizes he's been seen and faces the music.

PETER
You busted me.

FRIDA
Are you following me?

PETER
No... no... this is embarrassing.
I was returning your pillowcase...
and I saw you cross the street...
and I sort of started following
you. I just find you really
intriguing. I don't know why.

FRIDA
Intriguing?

Someone walks by, walking a dog. The dog barks viciously at
Frida, and the dog's owner has a tough time controlling him.
Frida looks afraid. Peter's a little weirded out too. The
dog's owner finally drags the barking dog away.

FRIDA
I gotta get going.
Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.

PETER
At least let me give you this back.
I washed it.

Just as Peter hands Frida the pillowcase, Mark rides by in his
bike. He screeches to a halt, nearly falling off his bike.
Mark stares at the pillowcase.

MARK
What's going on Frida?

Peter checks Mark out. Less like a cop than a jealous suitor.
Mark looks at Peter like he wants to kill him.

FRIDA
Where'd you get the bike?

MARK
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's
this, Mr. Date-Guy?

Mark, clearly jealous, looks at Peter, then the pillowcase.

FRIDA
No, this is Peter. He's a cop.

Mark suddenly seems nervous.

MARK
Oh, hi, uh, Pete. Gotta run Frida.

He takes off on his bike. Peter and Frida watch him ride off.

PETER
Being a cop has such a warm effect
on people.

FRIDA
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In
case you couldn't tell. I think
he's been following me.

PETER
There's a lot of that going around.

She starts walking. Peter walks beside her.

PETER
You wanna get some coffee?

FRIDA
I'm trying to stay away from
caffeine.

PETER
Some decaf then? That was stupid.
Obviously you said you were staying
away from caffeine as a nice way of
blowing me off.

FRIDA
No. Really. I don't drink coffee
anymore. I used to love it but my
tastes have changed recently.

PETER
Okay well. Maybe some other time.
They continue walking together.

PETER
So what book did you buy?

FRIDA
Oh, it's nothing.

PETER
No really, I love knowing what
people read.

FRIDA
It's stupid.

PETER
I can forgive you a bestseller.

Frida takes her book out of her bag. It says "The PMS Diet."

PETER
My mom used to get PMS too.

FRIDA
Used to? Did it stop finally?

PETER
No, she died when I was twelve.

FRIDA
I'm sorry.

PETER
I've had time to get over it. She
was killed by wolves they think.

FRIDA
Oh my god, by wolves?

A chill runs down Frida's spine.

PETER
We lived in northern Minnesota.
She went for a walk one night and
they never found her body -- just
her torn apart clothes with her
blood and wolf blood on them. Then
the town rounded up bunch of
hunters and shot all the wolves in
the area.

FRIDA
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure
puts my problems in perspective.

PETER
The weird thing is I've had an odd,
morbid fascination with wolves ever
since.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Frida and Peter are walking across the bridge. The sun begins
setting. They look like they've talked all day.

FRIDA
I've read scripts about detectives,
but never met one. Must be wild.

PETER
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like
this Gregory Jameson case. We
don't even know what killed him.
I'm putting together little details
to see if we're missing something.

FRIDA
Like what?

PETER
You know how moms always tell you
to wear clean underwear in case
you're in an accident? Well this
guy wasn't wearing any underwear.

FRIDA
A lot of people don't wear
underwear.

PETER
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would
need briefs to keep things in line.

Frida blushes.

PETER
Sorry. Sometimes I'm a bit frank.

They keep walking for a few moments.

FRIDA
How about you? Briefs or boxers?

PETER
Briefs.

FRIDA
Cool. I don't get guys who wear
boxers. My ex wore boxers. I
never got how he could wear khakis
and not have his boxers bunch up.

PETER
Me neither. That's why I wear
briefs... So why did you and...
Mark break up?

FRIDA
He's bad news. He cheated on me,
he insults me. Now suddenly he
gets jealous if I have a date.

They keep walking. CU of Peter and Frida's hands as they
accidentally hit a few times as they walk. Peter reaches over
and touches her fingers. They hold hands for a moment, then
Frida lets go.

EXT. NY CITY - NIGHT

Night shots from throughout NY city. We hear Frida and
Peter's dialog over ominous shots.

FRIDA
I really gotta get going.

PETER
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we
could... get a bite sometime?

FRIDA
Yeah. Maybe.

PETER
Goodnight.

FRIDA
Goodnight.

We see the moon and it's nearly full.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer and Frida, on their way in, plunk themselves down
with big shopping bags.

FRIDA
I don't think I've ever actually
liked anyone I've dated before.
Peter even likes me without makeup.

JENNIFER
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.

FRIDA
I don't know much about him. How
do you know if a guy is decent?

JENNIFER
Give him the tampon test.

FRIDA
What the hell is the tampon test?

JENNIFER
You're at his place, and you come
out of the bathroom looking all shy
and say, "I'm so embarrassed but
could you run out and get me some
tampons?" If he says no, he's too
embarrassed, then you know he's a
wus. If he says he's got some in
the bathroom, then you know there
are other women around a lot. But
if he says yes and goes to get you
tampons, well then he's a decent
guy. Then, while he's out...

Jennifer's voice over continues into the next scene.

INT. PETER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Frida is searching through Peter's desk.

JENNIFER (V.0.)
... you search his apartment. Look
for drugs in his medicine cabinet,
look for pictures of women, look
for bank statements.

Frida looks at some framed pictures, one of Peter when he was
a boy with his mother. Lots of pictures of Peter as a
teenager with wolf-looking dogs.

She searches some drawers and finds just normal guy stuff.
His police badge. His bookshelves are filled with wolf-
related books: Virginia Wolf, Thomas Wolfe, The Three Little
Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood. His CD collection: Bob Seeger
and the Silver Bullet Band and Los Lobos.

Suddenly she hears the front door opening. She quickly
straightens herself up and spins around as Peter opens the
door holding a bag full of tampon boxes.

PETER
I didn't know what kind to get.

He dumps out the bag. He got every make and model of tampon.

PETER
So I got one of each.

INT. PETER'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Frida sits at a candle-lit dining room table while Peter
serves her a dinner he's cooked and pours her some wine.
Frida notices some bullets in a glass frame on the wall.

FRIDA
What are those?

PETER
Silver bullets. A collectors item.
These are very valuable. They were
melted down from a crucifix.

FRIDA
What are they for?

PETER
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia.
Some people collect beanie
babies... I collect silver bullets.

They both eat. Frida takes a sip of wine.

INT. PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Frida and Peter are on the floor in front of the fireplace.
They have a long, slow, ongoing kiss and cling to each other
while they have dialog in between.

PETER
So... did you rummage through my
stuff while I was gone?

He kisses her again.

FRIDA
What?

They kiss between sentences.

PETER
I'm a cop -- I notice everything.
That drawer's ajar, that picture's
been moved about an inch, the
closet wasn't closed when I left...

FRIDA
Okay, you busted me.

They continue to kiss. Things start getting hot and heavy.
Frida lies back on the ground and gently pulls Peter on top of
her. They kiss for a moment then Peter pulls away.

FRIDA
What's wrong?

PETER
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well
don't you have your period?

FRIDA
My period? No.

Peter's confused.

PETER
But... what were those tampons for?

Frida remembers now.

FRIDA
Oh, yes, you're right. I guess I
got carried away in the moment.

Frida straightens herself up.

PETER
I mean we can still... whatever...
Maybe I should get a towel?

FRIDA
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should
go. I mean... I don't want our
first time to be like this.

PETER
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can
just sleep. I just want to wake up
with you.

Frida has an itch on her arm. She looks at it and in a quick
flash, her arm looks incredibly hairy -- then it returns to
normal. Frida's freaked out. She puts her arms behind her
back. Peter doesn't get what's wrong.

FRIDA
I have to go. I'm not good at
relationships.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida wakes up. She squints instinctively and looks for her
glasses. Then she realizes she can see clearly and doesn't
need them.

Sammy the cat immediately whizzes by hissing and ducks into
the other room. Frida looks insulted.

Frida looks in the hand mirror and notices her eyes have a
strange glow. She opens her mouth and her lower teeth look a
bit like wolves' teeth. She looks back up at her eyes again
and blinks, doing a double take. She looks down at her teeth
again and now they seem normal.

Frida inspects her face for facial hair. She touches her
breasts, which feel large and painful.

INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Frida looks through the "The PMS Diet" book and makes a list.
Strange spices, odd and completely unappetizing ingredients.

MONTAGE of Frida coming back into apartment with all the diet
regimen stuff -- also bottles of Neet hair remover and tough
nail clippers, Midol.

Some ultra-quick cuts -- jump cuts, etc. of Frida working out,
trying to stick with her diet. Finally a shot of her covered
in chocolate like Al Pacino with cocaine in "Scarface."

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida, still with chocolate on her face, is on the phone.

FRIDA
I'm freaking out. I'm like an
animal and totally out of control.
My arms keep getting really hairy.

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
You have to stop being so self-
critical Frida.

FRIDA
I looked like an Italian man!

Jennifer laughs over the phone. Frida's dead serious.

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jennifer, also on a cordless phone, is getting ready to go
out. She wears a tight dress and is putting on red lipstick.
George comes up behind her and kisses her neck.

JENNIFER
How'd it go with the cop?

FRIDA (ON PHONE)
We almost slept together... and...
then the hair started and I booked.

JENNIFER
Frida, this hair thing is all in
your head. You're using it as an
excuse not to get close to anyone.

FRIDA (ON PHONE)
It's just as well. I'm afraid of
getting hurt again. Mark seemed
great at first too. I don't want
to get too attached to Peter and
then find out he's a creep.

JENNIFER
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out
with the three of us.

George hears this, shakes his head and motions to Jennifer
furiously with his hands, "No, no!" Jennifer shrugs him off.

FRIDA (ON PHONE)
Carlton hated me.

George glares at Jennifer. She playfully blows him a kiss.

BACK TO FRIDA'S APARTMENT

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
No he didn't. Come on, I don't
want to be alone with those two.
All they talk about is basketball
and it bores the hell out of me.

FRIDA
Okay. I guess so.

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
Great. George is meeting Carlton
first for drinks. We can meet and
go together. It'll be a blast.

INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY

Peter's eating a TV dinner, alone. He's doing a crossword
puzzle. CU of the puzzle -- Peter has written the name
"Frida" everywhere.

INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer finishes her make-up and George paces the room.

JENNIFER
Come on, I've been working with
Frida. Carlton won't even
recognize her now. She's really
coming out of her shell.

GEORGE
She's just so... pathetic.

JENNIFER
She's just insecure. Once you get
to know her she's fabulous.

GEORGE
She'll talk about PMS and stare at
her salad.

INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

A montage as Frida spreads Neet on her body in the shower.
Frida getting dressed. Her breasts are so big that she can't
fit into her biggest bra. She improvises with some tape.

EXT. STREET - DUSK

A pair of high heels walk down the street. We hear a guy's
whistle. Pan up the sexy legs that wear them. She's wearing
a miniskirt and a short jacket. Finally we get to her face
and it's Frida! She's a knockout. Beside her walks Jennifer.

Frida's sexier than we've seen her. Even Jennifer looks at
her like, "Wow." The PMS starting again makes her sexy.

FRIDA
I started out on that eye-of-newt
diet the doctor gave me and wound
up in the tub covered in chocolate.

JENNIFER
Well whatever it was, seems to have
worked cause you look great.

FRIDA
You're just saying that.

A couple of CUTE GUYS pass by. Jennifer looks at them,
expecting them to comment on her as men usually do. Instead,
the guys are checking out Frida.

CUTE GUY
Hey there beautiful.

Frida and Jennifer keep walking.

FRIDA
What did he say?

JENNIFER
I think he called you beautiful.

FRIDA
Oh my god. I've never had that
before. I've had guys say they
want me to suck their dicks and
gross stuff but no one's ever said
"Hey there beautiful."

Jennifer's obviously a bit miffed that the comment wasn't
directed at her.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

CU of Frida eating rare steak. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Carlton
and George on each side of her, hanging on her every word as
they had been with Jennifer on the previous date. Jennifer
sits a bit off to the side feeling slightly left out.

CARLTON
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly
steaks now, huh?

FRIDA
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing
down. I'm just starving.

CARLTON
Don't apologize. It's great to see
a woman really enjoying her food.
I hate it when I buy a woman dinner
and she won't even touch it.

GEORGE
Yeah Jen here's always dieting and
eating like a bird.

Jennifer is picking at her plate.

CARLTON
No one I've run into knows what
"coyote ugly" means.

FRIDA
Maybe that bartender made it up. I
mean I think coyotes are rather
beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is
really a compliment. Like someone
who's conventionally "ugly" but is
really beautiful.

CARLTON
Yeah that's like a three bagger.
Today a bag is also a condom, so
now a three bagger can be a chick
that's really hot. So hot you
gotta put several condoms on to
dull the senses.

JENNIFER
Charming Carlton.

FRIDA
It is so hot in here.

Frida takes off her jacket which reveals her newly large
breasts nearly bulging out of her shirt. Everyone at the
table can't help but notice.

FRIDA
Bag means condom now? I can't keep
up with the word "bag." It used to
be "No, that's not my bag" --
meaning not my thing. But now "my
bag" means "my fault."

JENNIFER
I still thought it was a purse.

GEORGE
Actually, it's "my bad" -- not "my
bag."  But you forgot the verb. To
bag. "I want to bag her."

FRIDA
Yeah but does that mean fuck her or
kill her? Like a body bag?

Frida gulps down her water. Before she has a chance to ask
for more, Carlton and George trip over themselves getting the
waiter's attention.

CARLTON
Waiter! She needs more water.

GEORGE
Can we get some service here?

Jennifer takes her cigarette pack out and offers one to
George. He takes one as does Jennifer. She puts her
cigarette in her mouth and George lights his. Jennifer leans
over, expecting George to light her cigarette as well, but
he's not paying attention to her, so he blows out his match.
Jennifer is not amused. Frida's eyes light up at the smoke.

FRIDA
I have to go to the bathroom.

She bolts up, waving away the smoke. Jennifer follows her.

INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Frida and Jennifer are fixing their make-up in the mirror.

JENNIFER
You might want to tape your nipples
down next time. It's really
distracting.

FRIDA
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't
even fit. I've been going to
Victoria's Secret and exchanging
bras for bigger ones and still I'm
busting out. It's this PMS.

JENNIFER
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.

FRIDA
No you don't, believe me.

Frida looks at her arm.

FRIDA
Oh my god, look. My arms are so
hairy!

JENNIFER
No they're not.

They compare arms.

FRIDA
Yes they are! Look how much more
hair I have than you!

JENNIFER
It's just cause mine is finer. A
little bleach'll fix that.

FRIDA
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.

A shot of Frida and Jennifer's arms and we don't see much
difference in them.

INT. RESTAURANT/BOOTH - NIGHT

Carlton and George back at the table.

CARLTON
No way is that the same chick. The
other one was a dog.

GEORGE
Jennifer gave her a make-over.

CARLTON
Looks like a helluva lot more than
a make-over. Was there surgery
involved?

George and Carlton ponder this.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Frida and Carlton walk through a remote area of Central Park.

CARLTON
Sorry I didn't recognize you
earlier. You look so different.

FRIDA
I've changed a lot lately.

Carlton stops walking. Frida stops as well. Carlton touches
Frida's hair. Frida looks at him like she's tempted. She
sniffs, then turns away and keeps walking. Carlton walks too.
Carlton lights a cigarette. Frida flinches. Her eyes glow.

FRIDA
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

CARLTON
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills.
I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem
like all the cool people smoke?

FRIDA
No.

CARLTON
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...

FRIDA
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.

CARLTON
Yeah but they looked cool...

Carlton's voice trails off as he rambles on. Meanwhile Frida
is feeling strange symptoms. She's scratching like a dog.
She smells something and starts sniffing around.

Frida hears snippets of other conversations in various parts
of the park: a hold-up, a couple arguing, a couple making out.
Frida's head is spinning and she's breathing heavily. She
hears Carlton again.

CARLTON
As James Dean said, "Live fast, die
young, and leave a good-looking
corpse."

ECU of Frida scratching herself with wolfian nails.

FRIDA
What?

CARLTON
Your lips look delicious.

Frida circles him slowly, staring into his eyes. He's turned
on and intrigued. She takes off her jacket, breathing heavily.
She zones in closer. Finally she's within reaching distance,
and Carlton grabs her waist and pulls her toward him.

CARLTON
Wow your body's really hot.

FRIDA
I've been working out.

CARLTON
I mean body temperature. Do you
have a fever?

FRIDA
Never felt better.

She pulls the cigarette out of his hand and stomps it out.
She grabs his face and kisses him passionately. Then she
pulls away violently, which sends him spinning for a second.
He looks up and she's vanished. All Carlton sees is darkness.

CARLTON
Frida? Was it something I said?

INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

George is lifting some free weights. Jennifer's trying on a
wonderbra, trying to make her chest look bigger.

JENNIFER
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are
getting along?

GEORGE
Carlton insisted on leaving with
her. Maybe he got lucky.

JENNIFER
So now being with Frida is lucky?
I thought you said she was a flake.

GEORGE
Well the flake got a lot hotter.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Carlton is still searching in the darkness for Frida. He
hears a low growling from somewhere behind him.

CARLTON
Frida? Is this some sort of game?
(playfully, as if calling a
dog)
Here Frida... Here girl....

He turns around but sees nothing. He takes a few more steps.

He hears another growl -- a bit louder and seeming a bit
closer. Carlton turns around and seems scared by what he
sees. He backpedals quickly away and breaks into a jog.

Whatever Carlton sees starts chasing him. We HEAR growling
and Carlton looks scared to death. He runs through the park
and is chased until he falls down, and we zoom in closer on
his terrified face as he screams. The growling gets louder.
Carlton's face is blocked by a shadow.

EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

A quiet and serene morning. DOLLY IN towards Frida's window.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Move in slowly on a CU of Frida sleeping -- same as the shot
earlier when she woke up with blood on her sheets. She wakes
up and sees a bloody handprint on her pillowcase. Frida's not
as alarmed, having seen this once before. She quickly pushes
her sheets down and sees some more blood and then quite a bit
more blood and...

A man's severed arm! Frida bolts out of bed screaming.

Frida goes back toward the bed where the bloody arm is in the
center. She circles the bed, wondering what the hell to do.

FRIDA
Holy shit, holy shit.

She picks up the cordless phone and dials, in a panic.

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

CU of George smiling, leaning against the bed backboard. Pull
back to reveal he's sitting up on the bed naked, except for a
huge mound of whipped cream that covers his groin. Jennifer
is scantily clad and covered in whipped cream, spraying more
whipped cream on George's mound. They're giggling.

The phone rings. Jennifer bends down and licks a bit of
whipped cream off George's mound.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida, panicking and putting large boots on, hears the ringing
through her cordless phone.

BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT

The phone keeps ringing. Jennifer giggles. George sprays
whipped cream on Jennifer.

JENNIFER
Let it ring.

George reaches over to get the phone and picks it up.
Jennifer's disappointed that he answered.

GEORGE
Yeah?

FRIDA (ON PHONE)
George, I need to talk to Jennifer.
It's an emergency.

Out of frame, Jennifer must be doing something to George,
cause he starts moaning with pleasure.

FRIDA (ON PHONE)
George? Is she there?

George hands the phone to Jennifer. Her face is now covered
with whipped cream as though she's just had a pie in the face.

GEORGE
It's for you. Frida.

JENNIFER
Tell her I'm eating.

Jennifer and George laugh. George hands the phone to Jennifer
and accidentally drops it in a pile of whipped cream.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida hears the muffled sounds of Jennifer and George
laughing. Finally she hears Jennifer, still half-laughing.

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
Frida, this is a bad time. We're
having sex and George actually
answered the phone.

FRIDA
There is a man's arm in my bed.

BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT

JENNIFER
Frida, you are not coyote ugly.
Everyone was drooling over you last
night. Including George.

Jennifer flicks some whipped cream in George's face. He
tickles Jennifer, and she nearly drops the phone.

BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM

Frida circles the bed again.

FRIDA
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's
bloody and... I'm not sure but it
may be Carlton's.

JENNIFER
You fucked Carlton? See I told you
he liked you.

FRIDA
No! Not fucked him, I think I
killed him.

BACK TO JENNIFER'S BEDROOM

Jennifer is laughing. George spreads her legs and sprays some
whipped cream on her. From Jennifer's POV -- we see George's
upper half as he holds her leg up to the side of frame.

FRIDA (ON PHONE)
Please come over. I'm begging you.
What should I do with the arm?
Should I call the cops or... Peter?

JENNIFER
Frida, you're not making sense. I
can't come over right now.

Jennifer hangs up the phone and looks at George.

JENNIFER
Frida's hallucinating. Her PMS is
out of control.

BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM

Frida runs in wearing rubber gloves and holding a trash bag
and a broom.

She pokes the arm with the end of the broomstick.

Frida wraps the arm in a sheet -- careful to not touch it and
obviously grossed out. She opens the trash bag and spreads it
out on the floor. With the broom, she pushes the sheet-
wrapped arm into the trash bag.

MONTAGE of Frida darting around the apartment, searching for
places to stick the severed arm.

INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Frida has the arm in her sink and is trying to fit it down the
garbage disposal. The phone rings. The arm is standing
straight up in her sink -- half shoved down the drain --
fingers side up. Frida runs to get the cordless and brings it
into the kitchen. She's a bit breathless when she answers.

FRIDA
Jennifer?

MOTHER (ON PHONE)
No it's mom.

FRIDA
Mom!

Frida recoils from the arm and the sink. Feeling somehow more
guilty about it with her mom on the phone.

MOTHER (ON PHONE)
We're worried about you. "60
Minutes" was on same-sex couples.

FRIDA
What does that have to do with me?

MOTHER (ON PHONE)
You haven't mentioned dating anyone
since Mark and, well you're not a
lesbian are you?

FRIDA
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.

MOTHER (ON PHONE)
It's okay if you are, we just want
to know. I don't want to be
expecting grandchildren if...

Frida glances at the arm in her sink.

FRIDA
I gotta go. My sink is clogged.

Frida hangs up. She inches over to the sink and turns on the
garbage disposal. It makes a horrid noise and blood spurts
about, but the arm slowly makes its way down the drain.

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Frida is alone in the laundromat. She shoves the bloody
sheets in the washer. Behind her, Peter walks in.

PETER
Frida?

Frida quickly slams shut the washer and spins around,
startled. She turns red and looks guilty.

FRIDA
Oh my god, you scared the shit out
of me. You following me again?

PETER
(hurt by her accusation)
No. I was doing my laundry.

FRIDA
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.

Peter goes to one of the dryers and takes out his clothes.

PETER
Shit, where's my Michigan shirt?

He sticks his head in the dryer looking for it.

PETER
Was there anything in that washer?

FRIDA
No. Nope, nothing in it.

Frida backs up and puts her hand on top of the washer,
protecting it.

PETER
You sure? It's my favorite shirt,
mind if I check?

FRIDA
NO! I... I checked when I put my
stuff in. I always look through
the washer first.

Peter backs up, noticing Frida's acting weird. He's a little
hurt by her distance.

PETER
Oh... okay well maybe I lost it
somewhere...

He goes to his laundry bag. Trying to think of what to say.

PETER
Hey, I'm sorry if things got a
little heavy the other...

His beeper rings. He takes a cellular phone out of his pocket
and dials.

PETER
Yeah? Uh huh... What? Torn to
bits? Jesus Christ. Okay I'll be
right there.

He puts the cellular phone back in his pocket.

FRIDA
Everything okay?

PETER
A man killed in Central Park.

Peter runs out. Frida paces nervously around the laundromat.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jennifer looks at Frida incredulously.

JENNIFER
(sarcastically)
So where's this infamous arm now?

FRIDA
I put it down the garbage disposal.

JENNIFER
And what makes you think you killed
a man?

FRIDA
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my
nails turn into claws, I eat raw
meat, I roam the city hunting for
flesh. I've become a werewolf!

Jennifer stares at Frida.

JENNIFER
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course.
Frida, are you on drugs?

FRIDA
No, last night I think I chased
Carlton around as a wolf and killed
him. I woke up with a taste of
blood in my mouth and a severed arm
in my bed. And my throat hurts.

Jennifer sits down. She shakes her head.

JENNIFER
You're delusional. Maybe you had a
bad dream and bit your lip -- so
you tasted blood. And the severed
arm... well I don't see it and...
maybe this is all in your head.

FRIDA
It took me an hour to clean it up.
That was not in my head!

JENNIFER
Maybe the blood was from your
period like before.

FRIDA
I haven't gotten it yet.

JENNIFER
Frida, listen to yourself. If I
said I was a werewolf, would you
believe me?

FRIDA
I don't know. You have to take
Sammy. He's afraid of me.

INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits in her shrink's office.

FRIDA
I think I'm a werewolf.

SHRINK
Let's explore this. What makes you
feel you're a werewolf?

The shrink makes notes on his pad, "Insane. Delusional."

FRIDA
I ate a guy last night.

SHRINK
And how did you feel when you ate
this guy?

FRIDA
I don't know. I don't remember
doing it.

The shrink sits back in his chair. He thinks for a moment
while Frida stares at him. Finally he nods knowingly.

SHRINK
Dreams about killing usually
signify feelings of guilt. You had
sex last night and you feel guilty.

FRIDA
We didn't have sex.

SHRINK
You say you killed a man and don't
remember it. Couldn't you have had
sex and not remember it? It's
sexual. Why did you choose "eating
him" as the method of killing?

FRIDA
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!

SHRINK
You use the word "fucking." You're
sexualizing things. Stop berating
yourself. It's okay to have sex.

INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer stands near the door with the cat carrying case.
George opens a window at the other side of the room.

GEORGE
I'm supposed to put up with a
fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause
your friend's got PMS?

JENNIFER
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.

GEORGE
You have some weird friends. What
does her thinking she's a werewolf
have to do with us having the cat?

JENNIFER
Don't be stupid George. Obviously
if she's a werewolf, she can't be
around a cat. She might eat it and
besides, cats are afraid of wolves.

George sneezes.

GEORGE
Oh great. What the fuck am I
supposed to do?

JENNIFER
Take some allergy medicine.

GEORGE
You can't believe this bullshit.

JENNIFER
She's my best friend. I gotta be
there for her -- no matter how
crazy it sounds. I've been in some
bad relationships and she's been
there for me. She's lonely. If
pretending she's a werewolf helps,
then more power to her.

She hears another "meow" from the carrier.

JENNIFER
Do we have any tuna?

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DUSK

Frida, very tired, goes to sleep.

INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DUSK

George takes his allergy medicine. Jennifer is opening a can
of cat food. The doorbell rings. George goes to answer it in
the background as Jennifer feeds the cat in the foreground.
George opens the door -- Peter and Lloyd stand there.

PETER
Are you George McCracken?

Jennifer looks over.

JENNIFER
They're police detectives.

George nods. Jennifer starts opening the cat food can.

GEORGE
Yeah, I'm George McCracken.

PETER
We're here about Carlton Fraser.

Jennifer freezes.

LLOYD
Your address was in his pocket.

GEORGE
Yeah, we were out last night. What
happened? Was he in an accident?

PETER
He was found nearly ripped to
shreds in Central Park.

LLOYD
And he was missing an arm.

Jennifer drops the can opener. Peter looks over. Jennifer
picks up the can opener and puts it on the counter.

PETER
When's the last time you saw
Carlton?

GEORGE
After dinner, he left with Jen's
friend, Frida.

Peter looks at Jennifer, who looks like she's seen a ghost.

PETER
Frida Harris? Was she dating him?

Peter seems jealous. Lloyd looks suspicious.

JENNIFER
No, heavens no. They're just...
friends.

Lloyd looks at Peter. Peter changes the subject quickly.

PETER
Uh... do you know any enemies
Carlton might have?

Jennifer and George look at each other, shake their heads, "no."

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frida is sleeping. Suddenly she rolls over and opens her
eyes. Her eyes have an orangish glow. She's wide awake but
looks trance-like.

Fade to Black.

INT. SPENCER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

OVER DARKNESS, we hear the giggling of Frida and SPENCER.

SPENCER
Is Frida your real name or just
what you tell guys you meet at
clubs?

FRIDA
It's Frida. Frida the FREAK.

Spencer and Frida laugh. We hear the rattle of keys.

FRIDA
Having trouble sticking it in?

As the apartment door opens, we see (in silhouette) Spencer
carrying Frida over the threshold as a groom would his bride.
He then flips on the lights of his apartment and kicks the
door closed behind him. Spencer is longhaired and sexy.

Frida is dressed very seductively and wears a lot of makeup --
but she looks great. She's busty and curvy -- barely
recognizable from the frump of the first few scenes. Frida
holds her hand up to block the light from her eyes.

FRIDA
The lights bother my eyes. Can we
turn them off?
SPENCER
But you're so beautiful. I want to
look at you.

Frida takes a big whiff of Spencer.

FRIDA
Ummmm... you smell good.

Spencer puts Frida down. She immediately starts pacing and
circling the apartment, wolflike. She's on the prowl. She's
acting different than we've seen her before. Spencer is
wearing a Los Lobos T-shirt.

FRIDA
Are all these your guitars?

SPENCER
Are those your real breasts?

She struts over to him.

FRIDA
Why don't you decide for yourself.

Frida puts his hands on her breasts and gives him a deep,
aggressive kiss. She unzips his pants.

FRIDA
You're not too drunk, are you?

INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jennifer is on her cellular phone. She's hunched behind a
closed door like she doesn't want to be seen or heard.
She hears Frida's machine pick up.

JENNIFER
(whispering)
Frida... pick up the phone...

INT. SPENCER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Spencer leads Frida to his bedroom. He turns on the lights.
Frida turns them back off. Spencer turns them back on.

SPENCER
It's sexier with the lights on.

FRIDA
I prefer the darkness.

Spencer and Frida start taking off their clothes. Frida turns
off the lights before they're completely nude. Behind them, a
bit of light comes through the window.

We hear them going at it.

SPENCER
God, your nails are sharp.

Frida laughs. Spencer flips on the light as they make out.
Frida turns the light off.

FRIDA
Is this all you have?
SPENCER
Give it a few min... Oh yeah,
nibble on my ear.

Spencer flips on the lights again.

SPENCER
The better to see you with.

Frida turns them back off. We hear them going at it again.

SPENCER
I love it when you bite me. Ouch,
shit. Damn, that hurt.

Spencer turns the light on. He gets a quick look at Frida --
her eyes glow like wolf eyes. Frida turns the light off.

We hear Spencer freaking out and wolf-like growls and noises.
A vicious attack. From the darkness, we see the silhouette of
a human figure with wolf-like features get up from the bed and
walk off. Spencer is moaning.

The room remains dark for a moment. Then Spencer struggles
and turns on the light. He's all bloodied and can barely move
as he reaches for the phone. As soon as he grabs the
receiver, he dies. The bloody phone falls to the floor.

EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Peter and Lloyd are ringing Frida's buzzer. No answer.

LLOYD
I still don't get when you gave her
back the pillowcase.

PETER
We only live a few blocks apart.

LLOYD
This is more than fishy, this chick
dates a dude and he winds up dead.

PETER
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she
killed them.

Lloyd thinks for a second. He scratches his head.

LLOYD
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe
she hired someone to kill them.

PETER
She's not a suspect. What is her
motive? There's nothing, NOTHING
connecting her to either crime
except that she dated both guys.

LLOYD
Sounds like you got a conflict of
interest.

PETER
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on,
she's not here. Let's check out
her psycho ex.

Peter and Lloyd walk away. Lloyd glances back at the
building.

LLOYD
How do you know about her psycho
ex?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

We see Frida's POV as she runs through the streets. Quick
glimpses of her growling and panting. Shots of people on the
street who are looking at her, frightened. A little boy
stares at her as she passes.

BOY
Wolf! Wolf!

Montage culminates with a low angle shot of Frida's silhouette,
with wolflike features, howling in front of a full moon.

INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida's asleep, disheveled, with scratches all over her. The
phone's ringing. Frida stretches like a cat and gets up and
sleepily answers the phone.

FRIDA
Hello?

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
Frida? I was worried to death
about you. I've called you for two
days. Where have you been?

FRIDA
I've been here. What day is it?

JENNIFER
Tuesday. Are you okay?

FRIDA
Shit, I guess I missed work.

JENNIFER
Frida, Carlton's dead.

FRIDA
Oh no.

JENNIFER
And he was missing an arm.

FRIDA
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to
confession.

JENNIFER
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No
way could you have done that.
Maybe you saw someone kill him and
blocked it out... or...

There's a knock on the door. Frida whispers into the phone.

FRIDA
(whispering)
Someone's at my door. Maybe it's
the cops.

More knocks and Frida hears Mark's voice behind the door.
