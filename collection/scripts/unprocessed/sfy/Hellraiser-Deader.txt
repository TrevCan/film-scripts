FADE IN ON:
EXT., DAY, A BUILDING ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN
A big sign identifies this old brick building as the home
of "The Underground" -- a weekly newspaper in the
"Village Voice" mode, only scuzzier. We see a big poster
outside showing the cover of this week's edition. A big
headline reads, "How to be a Crack Whore" written over a
photo of a crack den in which we glimpse things better
left unseen. Beneath the headline is written, "A special
report by Amy Klein."
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, THE ELEVATOR
It's one of those too-small elevators that you find in
older buildings. There are several PASSENGERS on board.
Among them is the aforementioned, AMY KLEIN, a woman in
her mid-twenties. She's all in black, from her black
sneakers and black stockings up to her rimless black sun
glasses and jet black hair. The only thing about her
that isn't black is a complexion so translucently pale
that it bespeaks only the most rare and grudging
familiarity with daylight. She has a paper coffee cup
and a cigarette in the same hand, and she alternates sips
of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a practiced
proficiency. She ignores the unhappy looks of her fellow
passengers. She clearly has practice at this as well.
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, THE OFFICES OF THE UNDERGROUND
Little office cubbies scattered around a converted loft
space. Mostly younger hip-East-Village-type EMPLOYEES
with a smattering of non-hip-East-Village types. They
sit at desks, typing at computers, conferring at tables -going about the business of turning out another issue.
The entrance door, which leads directly to the elevator,
opens and Amy comes out, leaving a cloud of smoke and
several disgruntled passengers behind her. CYNTHIA, the
girl at the reception desk sees her.
CYNTHIA
Hey, Amy...
AMY
Morning...
Morning?

CYNTHIA
It' a 4:30 in the afternoon.

AMY
Mmm...
She keeps on walking, into the work area. She's about to
sit down at her desk when an ASSISTANT calls to her.
ASSISTANT
Amy...
Amy looks. The Assistant gives a broad gesture over her
shoulder, pointing toward the Editor's office across the
work space. Amy comes back up, nodding, and heads across
the way, toward the office. The Assistant picks up the
phone.
ASSISTANT
(on phone)
Mr. Firenzi... Amy's here.

Right.
CUT TO:

INT., DAY, BUD FIRENZI'S OFFICE
BUD FIRENZI, the Editor-in-Chief, is a man in his early
forties, sporting a pony tail which, like a moustache on
a sixteen-year-old, only serves to emphasize his true
age. He's fiddling around with some sort of TV/VCR set
up, and is looking away from the door as it opens and Amy
enters behind him.
BUD
(without turning)
Ah, I detect that unique and ubiquitous
combination of female sweat and
patchouli oil that signals the arrival
of...
He turns toward a dour Amy.
BUD

Lar?

Larry?

BUD
Can you come on over?

Amy, meanwhile, spots an open container of Chinese food
on Bud's desk. She inspects it, then picks something out
of it with a pair of chop sticks.
AMY
Are we being sued again?

So what?

BUD
Oh no.
(sees her eating)
Please feel free to have some of that.
Hmm?

AMY
What is this?

Thanks.

BUD
What? It's not up to your exacting
gourmet standards? Excuse me. Go
on, sit down. Just something we wanted
to show you...
He heads back over to the VCR. Amy ditches the Chinese
food and picks up her coffee again. She sits, lights
another cigarette.
BUD
Okay... rewind, rewind? Rewind. He
finds the button, presses it.
(He presses the button)
Somebody mailed us this thing around
two weeks ago but, in keeping with
our usual level of efficiency, Betty
didn't get around to opening it `til
this morning. Then she brought it to
me.
AMY
What is it?
LARRY JACOBS, the Managing Editor, a guy in his
mid-thirties, comes in through the time.
Hey, Lar.

BUD
Close the door, would you?

Larry closes the door.
AMY
What's the matter?
something?

This X-rated or

CONTINUED:
BUD
Something.
LARRY
It's bullshit is what it is.
BUD
Right, Larry. Okay.
(to Amy)
For the record, Larry would like to
establish up front that he considers
this whole thing to be bullshit.
LARRY
Did you ever hear of...
BUD
(speaking over him)
Amy, did you...
The two exchange a glance.

Larry waves the floor to Bud.

BUD
Amy, with your encyclopedic knowledge
of lower east aide skank-ology -have you ever heard of "Deaders?"
AMY
Debtors?
Dead - ers.

BUD
D-E-A-D-E-R -- S. Deaders.

AMY
Oh, sure. They're generally in their
forties, kind of ex-hippy types.
They still think Jerry Garcia is like
"really cool" even though he's dead.
BUD
Not dead-heads...
AMY
You know, sometimes they wear
ponytails. Dream about how great the
sixties were. You see 'em in the
park sometimes...
BUD
Love of my life, go fuck yourself.
I'm asking you a serious question.

5.
CONTINUED:
AMY
No, Bud. I've never heard of
"deaders."
LARRY
Show her the tape.
Bud goes to the VCR and hits the play button. Amy finishes
her coffee and lights a new cigarette with the stillglowing butt of her last one. She leans forward.
ON THE TAPE
The image flickers into view. It's handheld, low-rez,
clearly been shot in some dingy apartment somewhere,
decorated in a "mattresses on the floor/beer spray on the
walls" type decor. There are around half a dozen PEOPLE
there, in their twenties and younger. They drift in and
out of frame, in and out of focus.
We hear a woman's voice -- clearly the person who is
operating the camera, as the camera moves about the room.
This is MARLA CHEN.
MARLA
(off screen)
Okay, okay. Here we go.
Marybeth...

There's

The camera hesitates for a fleeting moment on MARYBETH, a
girl with bright dye-red hair (on the side of her head
that isn't shaved). Marybeth looks, with no particular
expression and goes away.
The camera turns toward a smudged mirror an the wall and
we get a look at Marla, a twenty-ish Asian girl.
MARLA
Here's Marla Chen, official Deader
Archivist. Hello, me.
The camera turns toward a door as it opens and SHEILA, a
young round-faced girl with dark hair, comes out, looking
a bit nervous.
MARLA
(off screen)
And here's the star of the show.
Sheila...
She gives a little smile. The camera swings over toward
a mattress on the floor. Some of the people are tugging
a plastic sheet over it.

CONTINUED:
One of them, and. The one who clearly appears to be in
authority, is a rather average-looking, serious man with
glasses, WINTER. Another is a round-faced young man,
also looking a bit pale and nervous, CARL.

the scene of the crime. Crime to be...
The image moves in on Carl.

Hmm?

Okay.

Okay.

The camera moves in on Winter.
MARLA
And here is the fearless leader of
the Deaders...
Winter glances up, then dismisses the camera altogether.
He looks off screen, then raises his hand. The room
Quiets. We hear various voices.
Shh.

Quiet.

VOICES
We're starting.

Winter looks toward Carl, clearly waiting for a response.
CARL
It's ready.
We don't know exactly what he means, but it seems to be
the right answer. Winter looks up and the camera swings
toward Sheila. She hesitates. A girl next to her starts
to prompt her.
GIRL
Say...
SHEILA
(cuts her off)
Okay. Okay...
(reciting)
My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't
real. My muscles aren't real. My
bones, my heart, my veins and nerves,
and flesh and meat... aren't real.

SHEILA (CONT'D)
What I see, what I hear, what I taste,
what I touch, what I remember, what I
think, what I feel, aren't real.
WINTER
(off screen)
Go on.
SHEILA
I'm not real.
The camera swings back to Winter, who gestures for her to
come forward, then swings back to see her coming.
The various people in the room gather around as she comes
to the mattress. The camera moves this way and that,
Trying to get the best angle to cover the action. People
spread towels on the mattress, over the plastic, as
Sheila unbuttons her long shirt and tugs it off. She's
naked underneath. She sits down on the towels, then lays
back, flat on the mattress.
Winter looks to Carl. He fumbles around in a bag and
Comes up with a big handgun -- maybe a .45.
SHEILA
I'm not real...
The camera moves in closer as Carl takes the gun and slips
it into. Sheila's hand.
SHEILA
I' m not... I'm not real...
She slides the gun over and puts it to the side of her
head.
AMY
...sits forward in her seat, not quite believing what
she's seeing.
AMY
Holy shit... Bud...
BUD
Just keep watching.
ON THE TAPE
Sheila is breathing fast now, but we can't be sure if
it's terror, or passion, or some combination of both.
She continues to lie on the mattress, the barrel of the
gun pressed against the side of her head.

8.
CONTINUED:
SHEILA
I'm not real. I'm not.
Carl reaches out, hesitant, and cocks the gun in her
hand. Meanwhile, we see other bands, reaching in,
Pressing a folded up towel-against the opposite side of
her head. Other hands come in and press a doubled-over
pillow against the towel.

Her back arches.

ON THE TAPE
Sheila holds her breath... and pulls the trigger.
There's a huge CONCUSSION as the bullet tears straight
through her head. We can see it splatter out the other
side, tearing through the towel and the folded over
Pillow, which catch a great blast of bone and brain.
We hear some screams in the room.
AMY
Jumps back.
AMY
Fuck !
(to Bud)
Have you called the police on this?
BUD
Just watch...
AMY
I want to know if you've called the
pol...
BUD
I said, "Just watch."
LARRY
I tell you, it's bullshit.

9.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Oh, man, don't tell me that was some
fucking special effect...
LARRY
You tell us.
Larry, sitting cross-legged in a chair, points back to
the screen. Amy turns.
ON THE TAPE
The camera is now pointing at Carl, who is tugging off
his own clothes.
AMY
(voice over)
Oh, man, this is fucking sick...
BUD
(voice over)
That's saying a lot, for you.
Carl, now stripped down, hesitates, looks at Winter.
Winter reaches over and kisses him on the lips. Carl,
Looking scared, turns down toward Sheila, who is lying,
as dead as dead can be, on the mattress. Blood has run
from the ghastly wound down both sides of the plastic,
and towels on-the side of the bed catch the mess.
Carl reaches down and plucks the gun from Sheila's
Lifeless hand.., and then, very gingerly, lies down on
top of her.
The camera moves forward and down as Marla, presumably,
elbows hex way through for a better vantage point. The
camera moves in close as Carl stretches out along
Sheila's body. He places his lips on hers, kissing her -or maybe something else. It seems almost as if he's
breathing into her. His body moves as his lungs expand
and expel, and he seems to be struggling toward some nonsexual climax.
AMY
watches, both repelled and fascinated.
ON THE TAPE
Carl continues his odd ritual, finally taking a great
final breath, as if he's reached the point of exhaustion,
and expels it. Nothing happens.

10.
CONTINUED:
WINTER
(off screen)
Again...
Finding what ever remaining reserves he has, Carl draws
in another breath -- he seems to be in agony as he does
it -- presses his lips to Sheila's dead ones, and
Exhales. The breath seems to go on forever -- longer
than it should.
And then, when it seems as if he can't breathe out
Another teaspoon of air, Sheila's body abruptly twitches
beneath him.
AMY
watches, not quite believing it -- not knowing what to
make of it.
ON THE TAPE
Sheila's body twitches again -- and then she sucks in a
ragged breath. Her previously open and lifeless eyes,
move. Her head raises up.
Carl, exhausted, looks down at her, smiling. There's
nervous laughter, sounds of relief from around the room.
Carl slides off of her. Sheila looks this way and that,
presumably at. The others, looking down at her.
A hand reaches down and she takes it. The camera follows
as Carl pulls her unsteadily up to standing. All this
despite the fact that there is still an exceedingly large
and obvious hole in. Her head... the size of a dime on
one side, the size of a half-dollar on the other.
The others move in, touching her, congratulating her.
She's still a bit shaky, uncertain. Then she lifts one
of her hands to the side of her head -- the side with the
big exit wound. She touches it gingerly, confirming that
it is really there.
Then she slowly slides her fingers IN. They penetrate
her skull, unobstructed, to the second knuckle. Sheila
takes her fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at
them, bloody. Yet she's alive. Fine. She looks up at
the others, then smiles widely. The others move in, giving
her hugs, pecks on the cheek.
SHEILA
(as if actually
realizing it)
I' m fine...

She touches the wound again.
SHEILA
I feel great...
She starts laughing.
Oh, man!

There is a moment of

AMY
What the fuck...
BUD
That's what I said.
AMY
Have you... have you found any of
these...
BUD
We haven't done anything. I told
you, we just looked at it today. By
some chance are you... interested in
pursuing this?
Amy hesitates, shaking her head, not sure what it's all
about.
LARRY
It's a waste of time.
BUD
Yeah, Larry here doesn't find any of
this at all intriguing.
LARRY
Oh, I was intrigued. Because I can't
figure it out how they did it. But I
know one thing... Shit like this is
only intriguing so long as it's a
mystery. So let `em run it on Unsolved
Mysteries or something because, all
bullshit aside, Amy... Amy, we all
know, deep down inside, what the
solution to the mystery La. The
solution is -- they faked it. This
is just some kind of bullshit shoton-tape gore movie.

LARRY (CONT'D)
And since that's all it can be, that's
all you're going find. Let `em...
let `em use it in some bullshit TV
special. They can run it after Alien
Autopsy Part III.
BUD
Look, Ame. Maybe this is just what
Larry says, but it sure smells
Different to me. I'm not saying that
we've just witnessed a bona fide
miracle. The fact is, I don't know
what the hell it's about. I don't
know who these people are... but I'd
like to know. If my dear colleague
here is right, and it's bullshit, you'll
know pretty fast. If it's not...
Amy, though, is only half listening, lost in her own
thoughts. She turns to the two men.
AMY
How could she...
She lifts her fingers to the side of her head, duplicating
the action of Sheila slipping her fingers inside the wound.
LARRY
Amy... you know what my father said
once...
BUD
That all writers were queers?
LARRY
No, that was a different time. This
time, we were driving down the block
and there was this fortune-telling
place, you know, this gypsy fortune
telling place in a store front? And
he said, "You know, if I could tell
the future I sure as shit wouldn't be
living in any frigging store front."
Amy, if somebody could do that for
real, they'd wouldn't be hanging out
in some rundown basement. They'd own
the fucking earth.
AMY
But how could she...
She once again duplicates the gesture of putting her
fingers into the aide of her head.

13.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
Amy, it's a magic trick. No different
from the kind of shit you see on a
stage. Just no sparkles, spandex, or
German faggots. Same thing.
(no reaction)
Amy...
AMY
(to Bud)
What else do we have besides the tape?
LARRY
Just a return address on the envelope.
Amy hesitates.
BUD
Hey, Amy, who says miracles only happen
at Lourdes?
LARRY
Who says they happen at Lourdes?
BUD
(to Amy)
Hey, do me a favor. Ignore this guy.
Just listen to me for a second, your
beloved Uncle Bud who pays your salary.
I'm not saying that this isn't what
Larry says it is. I'm not. I'm just
saying that it doesn't smell that
way.
AMY
Yeah, well, you do have a particularly
good sense of smell, don't you, Bud?
BUD
One of my many sterling features.
Amy looks at Larry, then back at Bud.
AMY
Let me see the envelope.
CUT TO:
EXT., DAY, A LOWER EAST SIDE TENEMENT
Amy heads up the stairs. She pulls an envelope out of
her bag. It's the one that the tape came in.

14.
CONTINUED:
She checks the name on the envelope -- MARLA CHEN -- then
checks the buzzers. She. Presses one, waits. No answer.
As she presses the button again, a thin young MAN comes
up the stairs behind her and unlocks the door. Still
receiving no answer to her ringing, she casually follows
him in.
INT., DAY, THE SECOND FLOOR
We see the Young Man coming up the stairs, with Amy
Behind him. They both reach the second floor and head
down it. As they start down the hallway, appropriately
ignoring one another, Amy winces and crinkles her nose.
AMY
God, it smells like something died in
here.
The Young Man, sensing the need for a response, looks
back as he goes to his door.
YOUNG MAN
I've been complaining to the super
about it for a week.
Amy, meanwhile, has found the appropriate door.
at it.

She knocks

YOUNG MAN
It must be a dead mouse in the walls
or something...
AMY
Something bigger than a dead mouse.
As she says it, her eyes suddenly come to rest on the
door in front of her. She stops in mid-knock.
YOUNG MAN
This place... I should move back to
Connecticut.
AMY
Don't let me stop y...
There's a bang as the Young Man enters his apartment.
AMY
Don't let me stop you...
She hesitates, staring at the door... then leans forward
and sniffs. The results are inconclusive. Then she lays
herself flat down on the floor, presses her nose up
against the bottom of the door and sniffs.

15.
CONTINUED:
She jumps back, scrambles up to her feet, goes to the
stairs. She almost slips as she rounds the corner,
heading down.
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, THE SECOND FLOOR
A short time later. A big black guy, THE SUPER, is at
the door. He, too, is sniffing, but not down on his knees.
SUPER
I see what you're saying. I see.
Thing is... thing is... I don't have
a key.
AMY
Then break it.
SUPER
No, who did you say you...
AMY
I'm Marla' s sister.

Amy.

SUPER
You're Marla' s sister.

Look...

AMY
She's my half sister. Same Mom.
Different Dads. Hey...
SUPER
Okay, okay. I see what you're saying.
Can I just... you want I ,should just
kick the door in
you want me to get
my tools...
AMY
Um... just kick it, I guess.
SUPER
Okay...
The Super steps back and slams his foot against the door.
It gives slightly. Another couple kicks and the door
pops open.
SUPER
Oh, man...
He and Amy recoil, clutching their faces, from the smell.
The Super heads down the hallway, retching.

16.
CONTINUED:
Amy stands facing away from the door, willing herself to
stand where she is. She inhales -- drawing in the smell
to acclimate herself -- and almost vomits. She steadies
herself, drawing in breaths through her nose, tentative
at first, and finally in larger breaths, until she can
tolerate it.
She looks back toward the Super, who is staring at her
from the far end of the hall, looking vaguely embarassed.
SUPER
I'm sorry...
Amy looks at him, then turns and pushes her way through
the broken door.
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, MARLA'S APARTMENT
Amy steps in and stops, struggling to keep herself from
retching.
She hesitates, then reaches up and takes off her
sunglasses and slips them into a pocket. This is the
first time we see her eyes, as they scan this dim,
prosaic place of death.
This is an average east village one bedroom apartment,
relatively bare -- some furniture rescued from the
garbage, some books, some magazines, some nondescript art
posters on the wall. No sign in the living room of
anything dead. No sound except the sinister buzzing of
flies. Amy steps cautiously in.
She looks toward one side, sees a closet with a double
sliding door. She slides open one side, sees nothing
that shouldn't be there -- a ragged winter jacket, a green
plastic rain coat, a hangar festooned with scarfs, some
other garments still obscured beneath cleaning bag
plastic.
She hesitates, then calmly slides the other side open.
More of the same.
She turns in the other direction. There's a little
kitchen. Nothing dead there. She starts forward then
turns back --staring at the refrigerator. She goes
quickly over and tugs it open. It's empty. Not so much
as a ketchup bottle. Curious, she opens the freezer.
The same. Empty.
She heads into the living room and down a narrow corridor
leading to the bedroom.

17.
CONTINUED:
She rounds a turn and finds herself looking down the
hallway toward the open-door to the bathroom some fifteen
feet away.
Marla is there.
The door to the bathroom is open and the toilet, on the
far wall, faces the door. Marla, dressed only in bra
and panties, is sitting on the closed lid of the john,
leaning forward in what seems, at first, to be an
impossible angle. Her hands hang forward, almost touching
the floor. Her head is cocked back, staring up. Her
skin is gray, swollen.
Amy takes a few steps forward, for a better look. As she
approaches, she sees the reason for the odd position of
the body.
A long bootlace has been tied around Marla's neck and
tied to the wall pipe on the toilet. The flesh of her
neck has swollen out, almost burying the bootlace. She
has hanged herself in this ghastly way.
Amy takes another step forward. As she does, there's a
sudden loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on Marla
abruptly rise up, alarmed (or whatever it is flies are)
at her approach. But they soon return to the corpse,
crawling about the face, around the edges of the glazed,
eyes, around the margins of the open mouth, rimmed with
dry foam -- around the outthrust tongue.
Amy steels herself -- and then walks closer. She looks
into the bathroom. On the corner of the sink, there's a
thick manilla envelope with something bulky inside -something that looks just like a cassette tape. There's
a name written on it, and the marker is right next to it.
She takes another step forward, trying to read the name,
and then hears something -- a sound of movement coming
from the living room behind her. She turns and hurries
back the way she came.
She rounds the corner, every nerve awake.
It's the Super, standing half inside the door, a
handkerchief over his nose and mouth, still unwilling to
come in.
SUPER
What?

What?

AMY
She's dead...

18.
CONTINUED:
SUPER
Dead...
AMY
She... I think she hanged herself.
In the bathroom.
SUPER
And she's just been there... that
smell. God, I'm sorry. I should
have come up before...
AMY
What? Look. Go call the police, all
right? Just go call the police and
wait for them... Okay? Can you do
that?
SUPER
I'll go do that...
(still on a different
track)
I'm a religious man. It's just... I
should have done something I guess.
But you never know what's going on in
somebody's head. At least I should
have come up when people started
complaining about the smell. I
shouldn't have just left her there
all these days.
AMY
It's okay.
SUPER
It's terrible that she should just be
there like that. All these days.
I'm so sorry.
AMY
It's okay. Go on and call the police,
and... and wait for them down stairs.
SUPER
I'll go. I'm a religious man.

I

He turns, stricken, and departs. Amy moves fast to the
door, closes it (as much as it will close) and then turns
back to the apartment. Then she rushes back to the
bathroom.
Again, as she approaches, there's the great buzz as the
flies rise from the body.

19.
CONTINUED:
Amy steps into the bathroom and then reaches for the
tape. She has to come horribly close to the body to do
it. She grabs it and pulls back, looks at the name on
it. It reads, "Winter."
Without further ado, Amy stuffs it into her bag. Then
she turns and hurries into the adjoining bedroom.
IN THE BEDROOM
Amy starts to search -- fast, thorough, -- she's done
this sort of thing before. She finds a journal, opens
it... no writing. She tosses it aside. Pulls open a
drawer. She tugs out what looks like a bladeless knife
handle. She presses a stud. A stiletto blade snicks
out. She tosses it back in the drawer, tugs some other
stuff into view.
Some bills, some shoelaces, loose change. An address
book. She grabs it up, shoves it into her bag. She goes
drawer to drawer, looking for anything that might mean
something. Socks, ragged underwear, cheap jewelry, tee
shirts and short skirts and jeans.
Amy stops, surveying the territory. Where to look next?
Then, deciding, she goes to the bed.
She reaches under it, sliding her hand around, tugs out a
dust-encrusted skirt. Feels around some more, hesitates,
pulls something else out. She brings it out into view.
It's a dessicated mouse. She grimaces and tosses it back
under the bed in disgust.
She stops.. then slides her hand between the mattress and
the box spring. She feels around, then stops, finding
something. She pulls out a little red paper folder -the kind that photographs come from. She opens it.
It appears to be a photographic record of another
"Deader" party. We see some of the same participants -only we also see Marla herself in some of the pictures.
She's smiling, clowning. Amy flips the next photograph.
It shows a stool -- just that, the featured object of the
photograph. It is draped in plastic, ready -- like a
photo of the altar before the wedding. And then Amy turns
a photograph and it shows somebody holding something out
in front of Marla. A length of rope with a noose on one
end. Marla is on the other side, framed by it -- a kind
of "joke" photo.
She has a kind of sickly smile on her face.
narrow. She holds the picture closer.

Amy's eyes

20.
CONTINUED:
The red-haired girl, Marybeth, is visible in the shadows
in the back of the photograph -- or is she' Because the
closer Amy looks, the more it seems as if the girl is
somehow, literally, half-melted into the wall, with only
her face and a part of a shoulder emerging from it. Amy
holds the picture closer -- it's hard to tell. The girl
is lost in shadows, and the closer she looks the more
reality merges with the grains of the photo.
Then there's another noise. Nothing loud or drastic, but
it brings Amy up short. A tiny scratching sound, followed
by a different sound, a sound we've heard before. The
sound of-the flies abruptly rising from Marla' s corpse -as if something has disturbed them.
Amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the
unseen bathroom. She sits, silent, waiting.
Then the sound of the flies rising comes again -- and
again, more distinct -- something scratching. She keeps
her position, still listening. Nothing. Just the slow
steady, untroubled buzzing.
She stands.
And again there's the tiny scratching, and the rush of
sound, as if something has disturbed the flies. She
jumps, drops the photos. They scatter on the floor.
She hesitates an instant, then moves cautiously toward
the door, which stands at right angles to the bathroom.
As she moves around, she can look in through the bathroom
door, but Marla's hanging body still isn't in view.
She advances, until she can glimpse the edge of one of
Marla's hanging, outthrust hands, the tip of one finger
just touching the floor. Marla's long fingernails are
painted green. Then, as she watches, the finger twitches,
the long green-painted nail scratching on the tile floor.
The flies rise and fill the air.
Amy gasps and rushes forward.
THE BATHROOM
She comes around the edge of the bathroom door. Perhaps,
instinctively, she has interpreted the movement as a sign
of life, but whatever she may have thought, she comes up
cold as she takes a step toward the corpse -- and Marla's
head turns toward her.
It is still tied to the pipe by the shoelace. The shoelace
is still buried in her throat. The flies buzz up again.
The glazed eyes turn in their sockets toward her.

21.
CONTINUED:
Amy stands, half-leaned over toward the body, literally
paralyzed. Marla's lips move, the swollen tongue as well,
as if she's struggling to speak. A ghastly wet sound
comes out.
Amy's mouth is open too, and she is hyperventilating in
terror. Abruptly she looks -down -- One of Marla's hands
has reached up and is grabbing at the edge of her skirt,
tugging on it.
Amy lets out some kind of cross between a shriek and a
squeak and swats the dead hand away. As she does, she
literally falls backward onto the floor. But her
paralysis is broken. She rolls over and, in a halfcrawl, half-scramble, gets herself back up to her feet.
THE LIVING ROOM
She tears down the hall, through the living room and out
the door.
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, THE HALL AND STAIRWAY
Amy comes flying down the hall at top speed. She reaches
the top of the stairs and starts down and as she does,
her feet slip.
She slides down five or six steps, then over-balances,
throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the
polished stone steps. She keeps sliding down, finally
over-balancing again, flipping over and landing on her
back on the landing half-way between the floors.
AMY
Oh, fuck, fuck...
She rolls up against the wall, wrapping her arms around
her legs in pain.
AMY
Oh, Christ...
The Super appears at the bottom of the stairs.
SUPER
Are you okay? I called the police...
Did you fall? Look, just stay where
you are...
Clearly, the thought of "staying where she is" doesn't do
it for Amy. She gets up and hurries down the remaining
stairs, clearly limping in pain.

22.
CONTINUED:
SUPER
Are you okay?
AMY
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine... I'll
be back in just a minute. I'm okay...
She heads for the door, fumbles impatiently, then almost
frantically with the latch until it opens and she rushes
out.
CUT TO:
EXT., DAY, THE SIDEWALK
She comes down the stairs and almost collapses against a
mail box, gasping, struggling to regain both her breath
and her composure. People are on the streets, walking
by, studiously ignoring her.
A siren, part of the background noise of the street,
starts growing louder. She turns and looks up the block,
in time to see a police car turning down the street. She
feels frantically for her shoulder bag -- it's still
there, then turns and limps off down the block.
CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, AMY'S APARTMENT
Cluttered, full of books and mess. It might almost be a
guy's apartment. Right now the lights are off and Amy is
sitting on the floor in front of her couch, now dressed
in only panties and a bra -- an image unpleasantly
reminiscent of Marla -- especially with the spotting of
bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin.
She has a dripping ice pack in one hand, which she
applies to this bruise and that -- and a bottle of gin in
the other. She doesn't look happy. She takes a drink,
then looks toward a TV and VCR in front of her.
There's a tape half-inserted into the VCR. We can see
the empty envelope with "Winter" written on it, lying on
the floor.
The tape is within reach of Amy's bare foot, and she
lifts a toe toward it, hesitant. She puts her toe against
the tape-hanging on the edge of decision. Finally, she
shoves it forward with her toe.
It slides into the machine.

She grabs up the remote and

ON THE TAPE
Marla speaks, looking into the camera.
MARLA
I'm sorry. I just can't hold it
together. I just keep... forgetting,
and then I start slipping and, the
more I slip the harder it is to make
it work... I'm just... I sent a copy
of Sheila's change to a newspaper. I
thought if... if other people saw it
and started believing, that would
help... maybe even help all of us.
But it didn't make any difference. I
don't know what to do now. I don't
want to end up like Bobby. And I'm
starting to feel pain, too. I just
keep... forgetting. I'm slipping
back. My eyes hurt. The light really
hurts....
She takes off her glasses.

Her eyes look glazed over --

MARLA
And they've gone like this. Like
Bobby. I don't know how to get back.
I just don't want it any more. I
just want to end it. I'm sorry. I
can't... believe enough. I just don't
want to be here any more. I can't...
I...
She moves forward and shuts off the camera. It goes black
for a few seconds, and then changes to snow.
Amy sits, staring at the snow, her face empty. A phone
rings somewhere. It shakes Amy out of her fugue.
She leans over and drags a lap top toward her. The phone,
apparently, is plugged into it -- one of those headphone
type things. She drags it up off the floor, slips it on,
answers it.
AMY
Yeah...

I knew the message before I got it.
Okay, Mommy? I gotta go.
LARRY
(on the phone)
Go where?
AMY
I don't know. Somewhere.

Bye...

She hangs up. She waits a moment, hesitates -- then tugs
the laptop closer. She types something in.
We see a White Pages Directory flash on the screen. Amy
types in the name of Marla Chen. She comes to an M. Chen -checks the address. It matches.
She highlights the number then puts the pointer at the
"dial" indicator. She waits, as if for a sign from above,
but none comes. Then she hits the button. The phone
rings. One, twice, three, four... then there's a click.
A man's voice sounds on the other end.
We can't really be sure.
VOICE
Hello.
AMY
Um, hi, is Marla there?

Maybe familiar?

26.
CONTINUED:
There's a long pause.
VOICE
Who is this?
AMY
Um, this is her sister, Amy.
VOICE
Hold on.
There's a clunk, as if the phone's been put down, then
some sounds of motion. Amy waits. Then the phone is
picked up again. But there's no "hello."
Hello?

AMY
Hello?

Then a sound comes over the line -- a hoarse gurgling
sound - a ghastly wet sound - the same sound Amy heard
coming from the throat of the hanged Marla.
Amy gasps, yanks the headset from her head. She punches
frantically at the key board, disconnecting the line...
then shoves the whole thing away from her. She sits,
breathing fast for a second, then she gets up, moving
fast.
CUT TO:
INT.,.NIGHT, A SUBWAY STATION
Lit with cold flourescent light -- this is one of the
stations that hasn't been renovated in many a year. Amy,
now dressed, with her sunglasses in place, slides her
card through the slot and shoves through the turnstyle.
She descends the long, non-working escalator -- the only
one on it at this time of night.
She reaches the subway platform.

It is virtually empty.

Amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the
middle. She looks one way -- far down the platform, a
lone FIGURE in a shiny green plastic raincoat lies
slumped over on one of the few benches. Amy looks the
other way -- a couple middle-aged SLACK GUYS in uniform,
maybe heading for some night shift somewhere, stand, not
moving, hands thrust in pockets.
She starts moving slowly along the platform, staring down,
looking for something. She stops.

27.
CONTINUED:
There's a tiny symbol painted near the edge of the
platform -- the stencil of a red flower. She takes up a
position at the spot. She waits.
A moment later, a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair.
A few seconds later, a train comes roaring into the
station. Amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as
the train slows. The train is virtually empty. One car
after the next rolls by as the train slows.
Amy waits.
Finally, as the train moves slowly to a stop, a car
different from the others comes in. This one, for some
odd reason, seems to have newspaper covering all the
windows -- taped up from the inside.
One of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop
directly in front of the spot where Amy is standing -the spot marked by the stenciled rose. There's a pause,
then the doors slide open -- just one the one set in
front of Amy. The others stay closed. The interior of
the car is dark -- the lights, apparently, are not working.
A tall BLACK MAN in a conductor's uniform is standing
there. He gestures toward the adjoining car with a nod
of his head.
BLACK MAN
Next car.
AMY
Is Joey on this ride?
BLACK MAN
Come on in...
She enters.

The doors slide closed.

The train pulls
CUT TO:

INT., NIGHT, IN THE SUBWAY CAR
The interior of the car has been transformed into some
odd-ball cross between a very small nightclub and an opium
den. Anyway, there are PERFORMERS at the far side, who
start playing as the train pulls out.
As the train passes out of the station, and the lights
dim, we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes -or at any rate something being smoked in some kind of
pipe, glinting in the darkness.

28.
CONTINUED:
Various hands reach up and tug down the newspapers, and
the tunnel lights come in, providing a flickering,
constantly changing illumination.
In the uncertain light, Amy can see the various
CELEBRANTS hanging out --- some on the seats, some on the
floor, some dressed, some partially undressed, some
engaging in desultory drug use, others in desultory sex
acts -- mostly teenagers and twenty-nothings.
Amy looks around -- not taking her dark glasses off, and
not particularly effected by the oddness of the scene.
The Black Man in the Conductor's uniform touches her arm.
BLACK MAN
Down that way...
He gestures toward the opposite side of the car from the
place where the Performers are playing. She threads her
way through the tangle of people. In the flickering
lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh, pierced
faces, pierced nipples -- pierced things that we can't
even be sure what they are.
Expressions flash by in the flickering light, some dull,
others laughing. She pretty much ignores it all as she
makes her way toward the rear of the car.
There, illuminated in flashes, JOEY, a thin ill-shaved
guy in his mid-twenties is sprawled on a seat. One of
his lower eyelids has a ring in it. It flicks up every
time. He blinks.
A young GIRL is kneeling on the subway floor in front of
him, obscuring his lower quarters, apparently giving him
a blow job.
Joey looks up and spots Amy. He points an accusing finger
at her, but his mood is good-natured. Throughout the
course of the following conversation, the girl continues
her activities, ignored by both Joey and Amy.
JOEY
Bah. Amy fucking Klein. Bah. And I
quote, "Joey Gambo, master of this
moveable MTA fuck and drug feast, sits
on his G-train throne like a terminal
King Midas squatting on a solid gold
toilet seat." That's the thanks I
get. I let you into my life. I open
my heart to you. And you make me feel
soiled.

29.
CONTINUED:
AMY
You are soiled, Joey. I only owe
anybody the truth, ugly though it may
be.
JOEY
Uh huh. You know, I hold a grudge, Amy
Klein. That's part of what makes me
what I am. And I'm holding one against
you. You disdained me in public, and
one day I will make you suffer -- so
long as it doesn't require any effort.
Yeah, okay.

AMY
Understood.

Joey casually gestures to the girl between his legs.
JOEY
Can I interest you in some oral sex?
What?

AMY
With you or her?

JOEY
Oh, her. I don't go for that sort of
thing. It's not me. It's the whole...
AMY
I know, I know. The whole hair in
the mouth thing. You don't like it.
You told me.
JOEY
You weren't so dismissive when you
wanted to vivisect my life in front
of the entire universe. You know,
you'll miss me when I'm gone. I'm
thinking of closing this thing down.
What?

AMY
No more wandering club?

JOEY
My life rolls on. The thrill is gone.
I'm thinking of becoming an urban
survivalist. You know, I have that
shaman-guru thing going. Maybe have a
harem or something. Five or six wives.
Twenty or thirty kids. Lots of high
powered fire arms.

Hey, don't go all bubbly with

Amy comes in close to him.
AMY
I need to ask you about something.
JOEY
I'm all ears. Well, all ears and

Klein is thrown into the pit of
oblivion -- or anyway is potentially
fucked up for life. A waste. If he
refrains from telling her... she may
yet be saved. And yet... there's

I'm coming.

He puts a hand lightly on the girl's head between his
legs. If this is orgasm, it's a very controlled one.
Basically, it looks like he's waiting for a sneeze that
never comes. Then, apparently, it's done.
Okay.

JOEY
I'm done... Bye bye...

The girl gets up and Joey tucks himself away.
GIRL
You taste funny.
JOEY
I am funny.
The girl yawns and wanders off into the confusion of
people.

32.

JOEY
(to Amy)
Go on.
AMY
I think they bring the dead back to
life.
He holds up the thumb and forefinger again, a tenth of an
inch apart.
JOEY
That's not even that much. Is that
what you think? That these are, like,
a bunch of Doctor Frankensteins?
That, like, they're zombies, and doing
that voodoo shit or something? Casting
spells and shit? It's all about minds,
and believing and what's real and
what's not. You get deep enough into
that shit -- I don't know what it is -but you never come back. I know people
who went in. Sometimes you see them,
but, it's like -- they're not there.
Not really. And I'm not talking "not
there" mental. I'm not really there
"mental." I'm talking "not there"
physical. You understand?
AMY
No.
JOEY
I don't either. When somebody turns
into a fucking ghost. And I'm not
kidding. For all I know, they could
be listening now. Right now. I'm not
fucking around. Sometimes, I walk
down the street at night, I start
wondering who the fuck is real and who
isn't.
AMY
Who are they? Where can I find them?
JOEY
I don't know who this Winter guy is.
I think he started it. But I don't
know where he came from. There's a
place they hang out, some of them -the ones who still hang out with us
humans.

This is making me unhappy...
(pause)
Avenue B and third street. On the
northeast corner, two doors down,
there's a stairway going down into a
closed up building. It's always
locked, and they're not always there.
I don' t know where they are when
they're not. And once you get mixed
up with them -- it's like that story
with the fucking tar baby -- chances
are you never get loose, and if you
do, you never get clean.
The "Conductor" shouts from somewhere.
BLACK MAN
Coming in!
Hands promptly reach up, covering the windows with
newspaper. The Black Man goes to the door.

34.
CONTINUED:
The band finishes its set as the light from the station
shines through the newspapers. Joey, looking drab in the
steady uneven light, stares at Amy.
JOEY
I can't take responsibility for you.
AMY
I'm not asking you to
JOEY
Amy Klein, listen to Uncle Joey, I'm
doing a change of heart thing here -don't do it. Don't go any deeper.
Forget about it. Move away. Change
your name. Become somebody different.
Come on.

AMY
I can't do that.

JOEY
Okay. Okay. Then, in that case... I
don't want you to come back here any
more. That way, I can imagine that
you did change your mind. You
understand?
The one door hisses open. Amy stares at Joey for a second,
turns and departs, back into the flourescent lit station.
CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, THE SUBWAY PLATFORM
Amy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut. The
train pulls away. She checks her watch, then moves to
the other side of the platform. She looks down the tunnel.
The light from an approaching train is beginning to reflect
off the curved wall of the tunnel.
She looks away -- and then freezes.
Something clicks.
She turns back in the direction she just looked. She
tugs off her sunglasses. Far down the platform, there's
a bench with a lone occupant - - a slumped over figure
dressed in a shiny green raincoat. She turns toward it,
staring. In the distance, no details of face or form are
visible -- just the lumpy figure in the shiny green
raincoat. She takes a step toward it. As she does, we...

The sound of the

Amy tugging open the closet in Marla's apartment -- the
green raincoat is there.
CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, THE TRAIN STATION
Amy is closer now, but still cannot make out any detail
in the slumped over figure. She approaches... as does
the train. There is no sign of movement.
She comes around, closer to the edge of the platform, to
get a more direct view of the green-coated form. As she
does, she sees that one hand is draped off the front edge
of the bench, hanging limp. The hand is gray.
Amy takes a step forward.
We see that the fingernails are painted green. Then a
fly buzzes out from inside the sleeve of the rain coat.
The fingers begin to curl.
Amy gasps, takes a step back -- and her heel lands on the
edge of the subway platform. She struggles for balance.
Abruptly, a man's voice comes from somewhere.
VOICE
Amy Klein!
Amy stumbles forward, goes down to her knees and turns.
Around twenty feet behind her, standing on the edge of
the platform, with his back toward the drop, is Winter,
wearing a black trenchcoat, cinched at the waist.
He. Looks down the tunnel.

Amy does as well. The train
She turns back toward Winter.

36.
CONTINUED:
He stares at her, with no particular expression, then
spreads his arms as if about to dive, looking like some
kind of sinister black bird -And as the train comes flying in, he calmly falls
backward, directly into its path.
Amy screams.
In an instant she's up, running alongside the braking
train. The doors open, but virtually nobody comes out.
The front of the train is still far ahead.
AMY
Hey! You hit someone!
in front of the train!

Someone fell
Hey! Hey!

The doors hiss and start to close. Finally, Amy reaches
the front window of the train. She hammers on it. It
opens and a middle-aged WOMAN'S face leans out -- the
DRIVER.
AMY
Somebody fell... somebody fell in
front of the train.
DRIVER
What?
AMY
Didn't you see him?
Where?

DRIVER
Where is he?

Where'd he fall?

AMY
Back there, way back...
She looks back in the direction from which she's come.
The bench is now empty.
DRIVER
Aw, shit... Aw, shit...
Amy, though, is now looking, this way and that -- at the
confused faces of people peeking out through the doors of
the train. There is no sign of a green plastic raincoat.
CUT TO:

37.

EXT., NIGHT, THE STATION
Some time later. The train is still there, doors open.
There are TRANSIT COPS on the station, disgruntled
passengers hanging out on the platform... TRACK WORKERS
are poking around underneath it.
Amy is leaning against one of the metal pillars, her
sunglasses back in place, staring at the empty bench -at the place where the mysterious figure was sitting.
She's looking grim.
Behind her, a Track Worker approaches the DRIVER, who's
standing with a pair of Transit Cops. He's shaking his
head, shrugging. The Driver curses, heads back toward
the first car. One of the COPS approaches Amy.
COP
Miss, um, Klein?
AMY
Yeah?
COP
Well, the guys have looked.
AMY
And there's nothing there?
COP
You don't seem terribly surprised.
AMY
Hmm?
There's a sudden hiss.

toward it.

Amy looks

The train is moving on one of the center tracks, so that
you can look through the windows of the cars and see
through them to the platform on the far side.
AMY
...and, um. I saw this man standing
on the edge of the platform, facing
away from it.
But now Amy is seeing something -- through the windows of
the moving train. On the platform on the far side, there
are a pair of figures standing -- one dressed in a green
plastic rain coat -- the other, in a black trenchcoat.
Amy jumps, looks more closely.
COP
Did he say anyth...
AMY
It's them!
In an instant, Amy is tearing down the platform, heading
for the stairs that connect to the platform on the other
side.
COP
Hey...
Amy is watching, staring through the moving train
windows. The figures are still there. Winter is staring
at her -- the face of the other figure is hidden beneath
the hood of the rain jacket.
Hey, stop!

COP
Marty!

Marty!

In the next instant, the Cop is giving chase, and another
Cop, clearly, the "Marty" called by the first Cop,
further down the station, is rushing in to head Amy off.
It's them!

AMY
Over there, over there!

In the next instant, Marty tackles Amy and she goes down
on her face. Her little black sunglasses go flying off.
Even with the rather large Cop on top of her, she's still
struggling.

AMY

She keeps struggling as the first Cop, and the others on
the station, converge on her. She looks toward the far
platform.
The two figures are still there, visible through the
windows of the departing train. Then, the last car of
the train passes, leaving an unencumbered view of the far
side.
The platform is empty. No sign of Winter.

Amy stop struggling, as the Cops tug her arms back,
handcuffing her. She hardly notices, but keep staring at
the empty platform across the tracks. She glances up at
the Cops.

A panting Marty looks down at her.
MARTY
It's fucking night, you bint.
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, A POLICE STATION
Simultaneously dingy and glary, it's full of COPS and
UNHAPPY PEOPLE. Amy sits slouched in a chair off against
a wall somewhere, looking particularly pale -- but she
has managed to find her sunglasses. She puffs aimlessly
on a cigarette. She looks about, without much interest -a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN crying at a desk, a young BLACK KID
holding a bloody rag to a cut on his neck -- WHORES,
JUNKIES, VICTIMS -- the usual users of Police Services,
waiting to be processed through.
A WOMAN COP passes in front of her.
WOMAN COP
You can't smoke in here.
Amy looks up at her, as if tempted to answer back, but
instead she takes the cigarette from her mouth and drops
it on the floor. The Woman Cop moves off. Amy watches
her as she departs.

CONTINUED:
A shadow falls on Amy.

She hears a voice.

BUD

Is this where the keep the cheaper
whores?
Amy glances up at him, without expression.
at her.

He looks down

BUD
Christ, you're lucky to have a boss
like me. Once again, I have saved your
small but relatively shapely behind.
AMY
What were they going to charge me
with, anyway?
BUD
Charge you? They were thinking of
shipping you to Bellevue -- you know,
for... observation. But I managed to
convince them that you were merely
irresponsible. You got your stuff?
AMY
Yeah.
BUD
Come on.
Slowly, feeling her bruises, Amy gets up.
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, BUD'S CAR
They drive in silence for a minute.
AMY
Why'd you give me this story?
BUD
Who else would have taken it? Either
they're going to think like Larry, or
they're going to be too afraid of it.
But Amy Klein... Tell me, Amy. Tell
me it's real.
AMY
It's real -- or I'm crazy.

I've not

CONTINUED:
. BUD
Well, either way, it's a good story.
AMY
I've got leads.

I'll know in the end.

BUD
You know, Ame, for the average person,
hunger for knowledge is like hunger...
for food. We want to know just enough
to take the edge off our appetite.
Then we're satisfied, and we stop.
But you... you're like a glutton.
You can't help over-eating.
AMY
I don't see you complaining.
BUD
But you see, that's the point. That's
why I need you. Because all that
stuff I don't eat... I still want.
So I send you in to do the eating for
me, and so I get to experience it,
like, by proxy, but without actually
suffering and mental indigestion.
AMY
That's for me...
BUD
Nobody's forcing anything down your
throat. Correct?
AMY
No.
BUD
You see, Ame, you never grew up with
all this Catholic god and guilt stuff.
It doesn't mean anything to you. I
worry about god and heaven and hell.
Not during the day, you understand,
but around three in the morning, it
keeps me up. I want to know what's
coming. What's up in heaven and down
in hell, or even if there's nothing.
It's useful, when you're making plans.
He turns the car toward the curb, puts on the brake.

BUD
So go find out.

And then we'll tell

AMY
You know, Bud, there's something
vaguely demonic about you.
BUD
Yeah, so they say. But, did you know,
the word "demon" comes from the Greek
word for "knowledge." As in
"demonstrate."
AMY
No, I didn't know that.
BUD
Fucking modern education.
The car rolls to a stop.
BUD
Door to door service. Not too many
editors do this shit. Now, Amy, go lie
down in your coffin until the hours of
daylight have passed, as is your wont - then go get me my story.
AMY
You know, Larry called me last night.
He was worried about me.
BUD
He's a sweet guy. He wants to save
people. Me? I just take `em as they
come. And use them as they pass by.
Amy gets out of the car, heads up the steps. She turns,
watches as Bud's car moves away, then she hurries back
down the steps, to the sidewalk below.
CUT TO:
EXT., DAY, AVENUE B AND THIRD STREET
A ragged, run-down place, looking bleak and ugly in the
bright light of day. We see the street sign, identifying
the place -- Avenue B and 3rd Street. Amy is there,
looking more than a little ragged and run-down herself.

43.
CONTINUED:
She crosses the street, heading east, on the uptown side.
She passes one side door -- and then comes to a building
that's been sealed up -- doors and windows cemented shut
with cinderblocks.
Beyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up
sideways against the building, running down to a basement
entrance. Amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow
bottom. Clearly, a couple year's worth of passers-by
having been using the space as a convenient garbage can -the stairs and the bottom are littered with trash. A
filthy mattress lies at the very bottom.
Amy heads down.
EXT., DAY, THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
At the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. A
hole's been punched through it and a heavy padlocked
chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy
hasp that's been bolted to the door frame. Some official
government notice of some kind has been tacked to the
door -- long rendered unreadable by the effects of time.
Amy inspects the padlock. It's heavy and uncompromising.
She tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the
chain -- but that's only a few inches. Amy peers into
the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing.
She stares at the door -- an insolubly solid puzzle. She
looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps
to the side and shoves it up, revealing the concrete
floor beneath.
There are scratch marks on the ground, like a wide fan,
marking the path that the door sweeps when it opens
outward. And the marks are recent.
Then, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the
hasp and pulls. The bolts holding the hasp to the wall
are loose. They slide out with it. She tugs the whole
thing free and pulls the door open.
There is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom.
Amy enters.
CUT TO:
INT., DAY, THE CORRIDOR
Amy steps in, her way illuminated only by the indefinite
light that leaks in from the street.

44.
CONTINUED:
She slips off her sunglasses and moves down the corridor.
There's an archway, presumably leading into the rest of
the basement, on one side, but it's blocked by a great
heap of rubble -- the detritus of some renovation that
was never finished.
Amy ponders the chances of getting through it, and
decides to check out the rest of the hallway. It doesn't
take long.
There is only a single door left -- at the far end of the
hallway. It hangs half-open, but we cannot see what's
inside. She approaches it, reaches out and pushes the
door open. It's a bathroom.
INT., DAY, THE BATHROOM
This is one of those nasty little makeshift places built
into an available corner -- basically a toilet and a sink
so close that there's hardly room to move. A mop and
some other supplies, long forgotten, long decayed, are
propped up in a corner.
Amy steps in, looks down the toilet. Nothing left but
some nasty stains -- the water long dried up. Her face
brushes against something hanging in the air. She pulls
back. It's a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb.
She tugs on it.

Nothing.

No power here.

She stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled.
She looks back down the hall. It seems as if she's come
to another dead end. Then she stares at the bathroom
door. Open now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall -the only place she hasn't looked.
Amy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and pushes
the door closed. As she does, of course, what little
light there is, vanishes completely. If there's something
behind the door, she can't see it, or anything else.
Abruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter,
and the wavery light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- and
the previously unseen space behind the door.
The walls do not meet there. There is a narrow gap,
leading to a passage, apparently "between" the walls,
perhaps ten inches wide.
Hesitating only a moment, Amy turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot.

45.
CONTINUED:
She holds the lighter up ahead of her, but its dim
flickery light does not reach to the end of the passage.
She moves forward cautiously -- the floor is littered
with dried chunks of plaster, rotting insulation -seventy-five years of stuff crumbled from the insides of
the walls.
She reaches a vertical pipe up against one side of the
wall - - only a few inches thick, but it reduces the
available room to under eight inches. She hesitates.
Meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. She
lets it click off. In some dim half-light we can see her
slipping a handkerchief carefully around it, for
insulation.
She flicks the flint.

The lighter lights.

And, abruptly, around a million roaches, which had returned
from their hiding places in the absence of the light, go
skittering every which way.
Amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant.
AMY
Christ...
She looks at the pipe again, and then starts to squeeze
past it. It's a tight fit. She has to squirm to get
through.
AMY
...Headquarters of the fucking Kate
Moss cult...
She pops free and comes out the other side. She holds up
the lighter. Still the light cannot reach to the end of
the passage. Steeling herself, she moves on. But as she
does, the space seems to get progressively narrower and
narrower.
From ten inches to nine, to eight, until both sides of
her body are scraping against the walls. She holds the.
Lighter out. The wall continues to narrow.
At the end of her outstretched arm, the walls are only
around five inches apart.
AMY
Shit...

46.
CONTINUED:
Clearly, she's reached the end of the line. Annoyed, she
starts to back out -- then realizes that the light on the
far side of her body renders the area into which she's
now moving essentially black as midnight.
She brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her
body, but she can't bring her hands together in front of
her -- the space is too narrow. Finally, she reaches her
hand up, over her head, passing the lighter from one hand
to the other directly over her head.
As she does, the lighter almost slips. She grabs for it,
but it goes out. Again she is lost in virtual darkness.
She strikes the flint. The light returns -- now
illuminating the other side of her body -- the way from
which she's come. Once again, the roaches go skittering
away.
She starts moving -- but something is seriously wrong.
The way back isn't widening. It's narrowing. She moves
forward, tries to squeeze through. She can't move any
further.
She holds up the lighter. The walls on this side now
also continue to narrow. The space revealed by the light
is barely as wide as her fist, and there is only darkness
beyond.
AMY
What the fuck...
Amy stands, simply unable to comprehend this. She looks
back... could she have somehow gotten turned around?
Confused about the direction?
She starts back the way she came... but now she can barely
move a few feet before the wall becomes too narrow to
pass. She pushes, trying to shove through the narrow
gap. But she cannot move.
She tries pulling back, but now she can't move that way
either in some impossible fashion, the walls have literally
closed in, until she is now literally pinned between them.
Gasping, Amy pushes against the wall she's facing.
AMY
What the hell is this... Christ...

47.
CONTINUED:
Of course the wall doesn't budge. It's solid as a wall.
Amy starts struggling, panic growing on her, trying to
climb, to crouch, to tug free in some direction, but she
is absolutely pinned.
She is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls.
Stop this!

AMY
Stop this fucking thing!

She's flailing her arms now, frantic. The light goes out
and once again she's plunged into virtual darkness. One
of her hands flies back and hits the wall behind her.
It clunks, hollow, as if she's hit a hollow-core door.
Breathing fast, she strikes it again, hearing the hollow
sound.
She reaches back with her empty hand, feeling at the
wall... her hand reaches something like the sharply
defined edge of a sliding door. She tugs at it... it
doesn't move.
Gasping, she slides her hand across the expanse of smooth
wood... until her fingers brush against a metal slot.
She slides her fingers into it and pulls awkwardly.
It slides over, into the wall, and she jams herself over
and swings around, now facing into a great empty space.
She stands in silence, breathing fast. She can't see a
thing. After a moment, with a trembling hand, she lifts
the lighter and flicks it.
The light comes on.
She is standing in a familiar room -- the room on the
video tape, the room where Sheila blew her brains out.
And it's not empty.
In fact, its full of PEOPLE -- the same people who we saw
in the tape. They have been sitting in the dark, and the
light from the lighter now illuminates them, shines in
their eyes.
They are all staring at Amy.
Clearly, they have been staring at her, in the dark. She
gasps, but holds her ground. Nobody says anything or
approaches. She looks to one side.

48.
CONTINUED:
Carl is there, much as he was in the video tape -- or is
he? There's something about his face that isn't quite
right. Amy stares.
He blinks. And then it is clear. His eyes are too large.
Not hugely, but perhaps twenty-five percent larger than
they were -- and certainly larger than they should be.
She turns the other way. A girl in the corner who was
apparently looking away is now turning back toward her.
As she does, it is clear that something strange is
happening. It almost seems as if Amy is witnessing the
very tail end of some tranformation back to human... that
the girl's face WAS something else, something stretched
out and doughy. But as the girl turns full around, her
features seem to knit together and we recognize her as
Marybeth.
She stares at Amy.
Amy is about to speak... and then suddenly realizes that
there's somebody behind her. It's a big BLACK KID, around
nineteen. He puts a hand on her shoulder. Amy gasps,
but it isn't a threatening gesture.
BLACK KID
Go on and see Winter.
there.

He's through

Amy tries to speak, but her throat is too dry. She nods
to the Black Kid and heads for the door he pointed to.
The others move away as she passes, but keep close,
distinctly inside her "personal space." She finds herself
coming close to a rather cute BLONDE GIRL. At any rate,
she'd be cute if her smile wasn't duplicated by a bloodless
slash that bisects her throat like a hideous toothless
second mouth. She walks on past and goes to the door.
She hesitates, about to knock, then changes her mind and
simply opens the door.
INT., DAY, WINTER'S ROOM
This is a small, dark space, light coming mostly from a
rather conventional-looking standing lamp. Winter is
there, sitting in a padded chair in front of a coffee
table, reading a book. Amy steps inside. Winter doesn't
react to her presence. Abruptly, the door closes behind
her. She hesitates and walks forward.
AMY
Winter?

CONTINUED:
He glances up at her but doesn't speak. Amy pauses,
unsure, then moves forward and takes a seat opposite him.
AMY
That's one hell of a way in.

WINTER
(cutting her off)
People come in here the way they want.
If it was hard, that was the way you
wanted it. A little mystery. A little
danger. A little magical "rite of
passage" thrown in. That's what you
expected. That's what you found.
Amy leans forward.
AMY
I know about you, Winter.
WINTER
Do you?
AMY
I want to join you.
WINTER
Really? So Amy Klein wants to join us.
Should we be honored? Or do you think
you can just go along with us for a
little ride and then get off when it
suits you, like with your friends on
the train? You're not going to find it
so easy to get off of this train.
AMY
So I shouldn't get on?
WINTER
You're already on it.
Tell me.

AMY
Is it real?
WINTER

No.
AMY
All of this, the tape, what happened
in Marla's apartment, what you did,
falling in front of the train? All
tricks. Hypnosis?

50.
CONTINUED:
WINTER
No. Not tricks. Not hypnosis.
not real.

Just

AMY
I don't understand.
WINTER
I can't help you. I'm not what you
think. Not a guru. Not a shaman.
Not the "fearless leader." I only
know one thing, and that thing, I
can't teach you.
AMY
Who can?
WINTER
Listen to me, Amy Klein. None of
what I'm going to tell you is real.
But it may help you if you imagine
that it is.
AMY
Okay.
WINTER
There are things that are true in the
light of day. There are other things
that are no less true, that live in
the shadows. When you shine a light
on them, they disappear. They stop
being true. That's because it is the
uncertainty of the dark that makes
them possible. If the dark is deep
enough... anything might be happening
in it. Anything at all.
AMY
Why did Marla commit suicide?
WINTER
Marla can't commit suicide. All she
can do is stop believing that she's
alive. And she can't even do that.
The more she doubts, the... the deader
she becomes. But she can't really
die, because she's not really alive.
She's not really anything at all.

51.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Not real, not real. Like what Sheila
said on the tape. That she wasn't
real.
WINTER
That's right.
AMY
What the hell does that mean?
WINTER
That's the thing that I can't teach
you.
AMY
That's bull. What I saw in that
apartment was real. What I smelled
was real. Real like this table.
Real like, like this hand...
She raps on the table. Winter leans forward and grabs
her by the wrist. Amy hisses -- the grip is hard.
WINTER
Please don't raise your voice to me.
I don't like being yelled at.
AMY
I'm sorry.
Winter, still holding Amy's hand by the wrist, reaches
forward with his other hand and uncurls Amy's fingers.
WINTER
You say this is real?
He begins to move his fingers over her hand, enumerating
the various parts.
WINTER
Epidermis. The dorsal faschia. Palmal
fashia. Here's the adductor pollicis.
The Opponens Pollicis. Median nerve
runs here. Ulnar nerve through here.
Proximal palmar vessels. Vincula longa
and breva. Transverse carpal ligament
across here...
The process is taking on an oddly seductive quality.

52.
CONTINUED:
WINTER
The median nerve underneath it. The
bones. First Distal Falange here,
Second middle Falange, Third Proximal
Falange. Down here, the fourth
metacarpal. Down here, the carpal
bones... And do you think that all
those parts are what makes a hand?
I'll show you what makes a hand...
here...
He begins to move his fingers through the spaces in between
her fingers.
WINTER
These spaces. That what makes a hand.
You get it by taking things away. You,
Amy Klein, are the infinitesimal speck
that's left when we take subtract the
infinet possibilities that the space
you occupy might might have held.
(refering to her hand)
This thing here isn't a presence. It's
an absence. It's a place where things
are missing. In all essential qualities,
it is less than nothing. In all
essential qualities, you are less than
nothing. Not solid, not here, not real.
Amy tries to disengage her hand, but he isn't letting go.
AMY
And what about you?
WINTER
Not real. Not me, not this hand, not
this table. The world has decided
that tables are to be a certain thing,
and because it has... they are. But
if the dark is deep enough, the hand,
the table, the flesh... they can all
come free.
She tries to pull even harder, but he holds her with no
effort at all.
WINTER
Listen to me, Amy Klein. You're on the
train whether you want, to be or not.
And I can't be your guide. You've
chosen your guide -- the one who first
took you into the night.
(MORE)

53.
CONTINUED:
WINTER (CONT'D)
She's the only one who can show you the
way, who can show you what you have to
do. But that's a problem, as I said.
Because she's no longer sure herself...
and she may already be beyond saving.
And if she's lost... you're lost.
AMY
Like Bobby.
WINTER
That's right. Like Bobby, whom you
know nothing about, and like a lot of
others. Nobody ever said enlightenment
was easy. They're still around, but
it's hard to find them, because even
they can't decide where they, or even
what they are. Maybe that's how you'll
end up, hanging forever by a bootlace
in a toilet, wanting to be dead, but
not quite able to pull it off.
AMY
Let go of my hand.
He doesn't move. She yanks again, hard, but he still
won't release her. Finally she hauls off and slaps him
across the face. This also doesn't seem to phase him.
WINTER
Don't think for a second, Amy Klein,
that you are not in danger. You are
in more danger than you ever imagined
possible. To be beaten, or tortured,
or raped, or killed... You think this
table is solid?
Be slaps her hand down on the table.

She winces.

WINTER
Do you?
She doesn't answer.

He slaps her hand down on the table
WINTER

Do you?
AMY
Yes.
WINTER
Are you afraid, Amy Klein?

54.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Yes.
WINTER
Good, because fear is the place we go
to learn.
He lifts her hand up and folds it, so that her index and
middle finger are sticking straight out, and the other
fingers are folded back in a fist. He casually turns her
hand so that the two fingers are pointed down at the
table.
WINTER
Close your eyes.
AMY
Why?
WINTER
Close your eyes.
Amy hesitates, then closes them.
her hand down.

Winter begins to move

WINTER
I'm moving your hand down. You're
going to feel something wet. There.
Do you feel it?
We don't see what Amy's hand is touching, but we hear a
kind of wet, sticky sound.
AMY
Yes.
WINTER
What does it feel like?
AMY
I don't know. Like... a mouth. It
feels like something sucking on my
fingers...
WINTER
Open your eyes.
Amy opens her eyes. Winter takes his hand away, revealing
the table beneath. Amy gasps in horror. The face of a
baby has somehow grown out of the table, and it's tiny
mouth is now sucking on her fingers. She pulls away,
trying to get her fingers free.

55.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Christ!
Winter abruptly leans forward and shoves the table over.
Amy falls to the floor and the table lands on its side.
As it does, it start to undergo a bizarre transformation:
The legs of the table start curling around, becoming soft,
whitish pink. Tiny fingers blossom from one set of table
legs, tiny baby feet from the other. The whole thing is
shrinking, changing shape. And the baby's face is changing
too... literally growing older. Amy cries out as she
finds her fingers clenched between baby teeth. She shoves
her hand against the face, trying to pull free, to drag
herself away. The table continues its weird
transformation, shrinking, thickening. The arms and legs
grow closer to their natural thickness. The whole thing
is also clearly "aging" at a marked rate. The face now
has a crown of black hair and appears to be around twelve
years old.
AMY
Make her let go of me!
WINTER
Learn a lesson, Amy Klein.
no games played here.

There are

AMY
I believe you...
WINTER
Not yet.
Amy stares at the weird twisting object in front of her.
The arms and legs are approaching human form, the lower
side of the table thickening into a woman's hips, the
bare legs swelling out from them. The V of pubic hair
blossoms out, and breasts form as the body of the table
collapses into the form of a woman's torso, lying
lengthwise on the floor, an its side. Finally, the
transformation is complete... and Amy finds her fingers
clamped tight in the mouth of Sheila -- the girl whom she
saw die and be reborn on the tape. Sheila, stark naked
and clearly in some feral state, abruptly springs up and
throws herself on top of Amy -- still clenching her fingers
in her teeth.
WINTER
Close your eyes, Amy Klein.

56.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Get her off of me!
(to Sheila)
Get off of me.
WINTER
Close your eyes.
AMY
Get the fuck off!
Amy gasps as Sheila bites down hard. Finally, Amy takes
a deep breath, and then thrusts her thumb into one of
Sheila's eyes. It slides right in -- but not into flesh
and eye. Instead it seems to sink into the stuff the
girl's face, as if the, face were made of clay.
WINTER
You can't hurt her.

She's one of us.

Abruptly, Winter springs forward, literally leaping, tigerlike, across the intervening distance. Lie comes slamming
down on top of the two, and as he comes down, for an
instant, it seems as if he's landing not on his hands but
on the front limbs of a white tiger, his face drawn back,
cat-like. In an instant, he leans forward and all traces
of the beast vanish.
WINTER
Close your eyes!
But Amy is in the midst of a full-fledged panic and isn't
about to do anything. Winter turns, looking back toward
the light stand by his chair. He swipes his hand back
behind him, as if to knock the thing over, even though
it's a good ten feet away from him.
It doesn't fall over. Rather, the upper portion of the
lamp quite simply vanishes, as if literally erased by the
sweep of his hand.
The room plunges into almost complete darkness. Winter
reaches back and tears Sheila off, flinging her away.
With a cat-like squeal, she literally goes flying off
into the darkness -- dwindling into a dark, cluttered,
distance, despite the wall that should have stopped her.
Winter turns toward Amy, who's still struggling.
WINTER
Close your eyes!

57.
CONTINUED:
AMY
No... no!
Winter reaches down and clamps his hand across her eyes,
then picks her up and flings her.
CUT TO:
SOMEPLACE ELSE, INT., NIGHT
Abruptly, she hits a vertical plain of safety glass.
bursts into a thousand tiny fragments and she goes
crashing back, through it....

It

Her head hits hard against a tile wall and she goes sliding
down, in the dark, her hand scrambling for something to
hold onto.
Her reaching hand grabs some metal handle. She pulls...
and abruptly, water begins to cascade down onto her face.
She turns herself sideways and rolls over, gasping. She's
in a bathtub... in fact she's just been thrown through
the safety-glass door. She scrambles over the bottom
edge of the sliding glass door, scraping herself across
the tiny pegs of glass that still line the border of the
frame.
She pulls herself up, her hand feeling for a light
switch... Finally, she finds it, flips the switch.
She's in a bathroom -- in fact, she's in her bathroom,
slumped over against the sink. Soaking wet, scratched,
shaking, gasping, she stares at herself in the mirror.
There's a tiny square of glass stuck into her shoulder.
She tugs it loose. It clinks as she drops it into the
sink.
AMY
It's not real... it's not real...
She lifts her hand to wipe the wet hair from her face...
then pauses. She stares at her fingers. No sign of a
bite mark. Drained, she turns toward the bathtub. She
reaches through the shattered door and turns off the shower.
CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, AMY'S APARTMENT
She's scrunched down in her chair, the little telephone
headset on her head. She's punching in a number.

58.
CONTINUED:
She hits "dial." We can hear the phone ringing on the
other side for a long time. Finally, somebody answers.
We hear a WOMAN's voice, sleep-blurry.
WOMAN
(off screen)
Yeah, hello?
AMY
Is Larry there?
WOMAN
(off screen)
Hmm? Oh, hold on...
There's a sound of motion, some voices, the words of which
we cannot understand. Then a clunk as the receiver on
the other end is picked up again. Larry's voice, blurry
with sleep, comes on the line.
LARRY
(off screen)
Yeah, hello?
AMY
Larry...
LARRY
(off screen)
Amy, you okay?
AMY
Larry, I'm going to quit the story.
Can you tell Bud?
LARRY
(off screen - pause)
Yeah, sure. Did you, um, did anything
happen...
AMY
I... I just don't know. I'm kind of
falling apart here a little bit. I
just don't know.

Where are you?.You want me to come
over?
Amy feels something, reaches a hand up to the pocket of
her jacket. She reaches inside.

59.
CONTINUED:
AMY
No...
She tugs out her sun glasses.

They've been shattered.

AMY
I'm just a little... fucked in the
head. I'm going to get some sleep.
LARRY
(off screen)
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.

AMY
Maybe not tomorrow.

LARRY
(off screen)
Okay.
Amy's attention is focused on the broken sunglasses.
Suddenly, she remembers. That she's on the phone.
AMY
Hey, Larry, did you know that the
word "demon" comes from the Greek
word for knowledge.
LARRY
(off screen)
Um, yeah. Yeah, I guess I did know
that.
AMY
Well, I wish somebody had fucking
told me about it.
LARRY
(off screen)
Right. Look, Amy, just take it slow.
Okay?
Right.

AMY
Right. Okay.

Bye...

She hangs up... then tosses the remnants of the broken
sunglasses into a wastebasket. She tugs the headset off.
CUT TO:

60.
CONTINUED:
NIGHT, AMY'S APARTMENT
The room is dark, drained of all color the way things
appear when we see in them in almost total darkness.
Amy's lying in bed -- actually just a mattress on the
floor -- on her stomach. The sheet has crumpled off of
her. She's dressed only in her panties.
Her pale, naked skin is visible in the dim monochromatic
light, marked with scratches and bruises.
We are MOVING toward her, seeing her as if from the P.O.V.
of someone approaching her, coming down toward the pale
vulnerable expanse of her naked back.
We come in CLOSE on Amy's head and shoulders. Abruptly,
a fly buzzes down, brushes her face. She doesn't wake.
Abruptly, there's the sound of a wettish "thud" and Amy
seems to bounce a little. Her eyes open, but she isn't
alarmed. Still lying on her back, she flicks her eyes
this way and that, but, seeing nothing, she closes them
again.
A few seconds later, we see some black liquid trickle
across her shoulder, coming from the unseen center of her
back. It follows a course down her backbone, then swerves
and finds a path along the inner edge of one of her
shoulder blades, finally trickling down her neck. It
continues to flow, staining the pillow by her face.
She stirs slightly, clearly feeling the trickle. She
puts her hand to her shoulder, smearing the black liquid.
Still half-asleep, she tries to "brush" it off... but it
continues to flow. Finally, her eyes open. She sits up
painfully and looks at her hands -- stained with this
sticky black stuff. She stares at it, not quite awake
enough to figure it out.
She reaches over her shoulder, pulls her hand back, stained
with the black stuff. She looks down at her pillow, also
stained. Confused, she rises, painfully awkward, and
heads toward the bathroom. We can see that her feet leave
blackish wet footprints across the floor as she moves
toward the bathroom.
She moves in, stares in the mirror -- sees the side of
her face and her shoulder, smeared with black. She fumbles
for the light, flips it on.
In the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, COLOR
abruptly re-enters the world...

61.
CONTINUED:
And the black of the liquid that's stained Amy's face and
hands, that track the floor of the white-tiled bathroom,
that smear the wall where she flipped on the light switch
turns instantly to its true color -The color of blood.
Amy gasps at the sight -- she looks like she's just
crawled out of a slaughterhouse. She reaches behind her,
feeling her back, trying to find the source of the blood
that seems to be pouring out of her, dripping to the
floor, pouring down the small of her back, staining the
back of her panties a vivid, ghastly red.
In a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink
full blast, washes away the blood from her hands,
scooping handfuls onto her face and the front of her
body. The water drips to the floor, commingling with the
blood, turning it a nasty pink.
She reaches behind her back, feeling again -- her hand
comes back as vividly red as before. Again she washes
them. She stops dead, seeing something in the mirror.
Something is glinting between her breasts. She touches
her finger to it. It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming
metal, poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny
steel splinter. It appears to have just barely broken
through the skin from "inside" -- barely a drop of blood.
She stands staring down at it, breathing fast.
hell is it?

What the

Then, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back
to the mirror and looks over her shoulder. She sees -and we see for the first time -- the center of her back
where her questing hands couldn't reach.
There is a knife there, literally thrust through the
middle of her back. The gleaming splinter between her
breasts is the tip of the knife that has literally
transfixed her -- and clearly transfixed the center of
her chest -- her heart.
She strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossible
thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. She turns
back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes.
AMY
It's not real... it's not real.

62.
CONTINUED:
She clenches her eyes... opens them. Her fingers feel
desperately for the metal tip between her breasts. It's
still there.
AMY
Wake up... wake-up... wake up...
She starts slapping her hands against the side of her
face -- not gently, hard slaps. But she isn't "waking
up." She grabs her hair, pulls hard. Nothing. She's still
there. The knife is still stuck, impossibly in her back.
She sits on the closed seat of the toilet... not knowing
what to do. She reaches again for the knife, but she
can't touch it. She buries her face in her bloody hands.
AMY
I'm dreaming, I'm fucking dreaming...
I'm fucking dreaming.
She stands, turns this way and that, not knowing what to
do. She looks around her bathroom, searching for
something. She tugs open the medicine cabinet, searches
beneath the sink, tugging the various stuff out. Whatever
it is that she's looking for, she can't find it.
She goes tearing out of the bathroom, scrambles across
the dim landscape of her apartment, into the narrow
kitchen.
She yanks open the silverware drawer and starts digging
through it. Not finding what she wants, she goes to
another drawer, full of junk, with various unused serving
pieces mined in.
Finally, she comes up with what she's searching for -- a
foot-long skewer -- a two-tined metal thing -- the kind
of thing that might be used for holding a turkey while
being carved.
She races back to the bathroom, turns toward the mirror
and reaches back with the skewer. Clearly, we understand
now what she wanted the skewer for -- to lever the knife
out of the middle of her back.
Using the reverse-image in the mirror as a guide she
reaches down, the skewer drifting this way and that as
she tries to get it into position. She slips the two
tines over the narrow handle of the knife... tugs back.
The skewer slides loose. The knife stays where it is.
Amy gasps and again struggles, trembling hand, to catch
the knife handle on the tines of the skewer. She finally
slips it back into position.

63.
CONTINUED:
She twists the skewer, hoping that torque will hold it in
place on the slick handle. With a groan she pulls back...
and the knife begins to move.
We can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish
from view, drawn back inside her body. Slowly, making a
wet, sticky sound, the long thin knife begins to slide
out.
With an couple inches of the blade now exposed, she slides
the skewer down, locks it against the blade, behind the
handle -- a better lever. With a gasp she heaves out...
and the knife goes flying. It bounces on the floor,
splattering blood. With shaking hands, Amy bends over
and picks it up. She stands, staring at it. It's some
kind of nasty stiletto. Amy stands, staring at it.
A FLASHBACK
Amy searching Marla's drawers, tugging one open -- pressing
the stud on a stiletto. On this stiletto.
INT., NIGHT, AMY'S APARTMENT
She looks down toward the floor. She is literally standing
in a pool of her own blood. She gasps, turns back toward
the mirror.
Blood is pouring from the wound. Gasping, almost crying,
Amy stumbles back into the main room. With shaky hands,
she moves to open the lid on her lap top, then realizes
that she's still holding the stiletto in her hand. She
drops it on the table, tugs the headset over her head.
Her bloody fingers press in the numbers -- 9-1-1.
She waits, standing in the middle of her dark apartment,
shaking, bloody. She can hear the phone ring and ring.
Finally, there's a click as the line picks up.
no voice on the other end.
AMY
Hello, hello? Hello?

But there's

Is there anyb...

Then she stops dead. There is somebody there, and making
a sound we've heard before. The nasty gurgling that Amy
heard when she tried calling Marla's place.
She stands, listening, trembling. And then, suddenly,
the sound of the gurgling changes.
Suddenly, it no longer is distorted by the phone line.
It seems to be close -- real.

64.
CONTINUED:
Amy turns slowly around -- toward the open door of her
bathroom.
She looks. Only now, it isn't her bathroom on the far
side of the door. It's Marla's bathroom. And Marla is
there, hanging as before... but not quite as before,
because her eyes are staring at Amy. Her lips move and
the ghastly noise comes out.
Then Marla raises her hand toward Amy and gestures -- a
gesture for her to come. In a sudden impulse, Amy lifts
her laptop and flings it toward the image in the
bathroom. It arcs through the air and abruptly strikes
something hard.
The vision of Marla abruptly shatters and vanishes. Amy's
bathroom abruptly reappears. The lap top has hit the
mirror in the open medicine cabinet door, smashing it.
The cabinet door flies back to the wall and rebounds,
floating back into view.
We see Amy reflected in the shards as she approaches.
She stares into the shattered mirror and realizes
suddenly that more than her image is being reflected.
Some of the bits of glass are reflecting another form -Marla's .
AMY
What do you want?
you want?

What the hell do

And then, in the shards, she can see the image of Marla's
dead swollen fingers -- gesturing. Gesturing for her to
come.
Amy stands, frozen for a minute, her blood dripping on
the floor, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Then she
turns and moves.
A MOMENT LATER
We see her rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder.
Hands trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct
tape that she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the
table, sticky side up. She presses the towel down so
that it sticks, then picks up the tape, with towel
attached. She slides the towel down the center of her
back until it covers the wound, and then tugs the tape
tight across her chest, compressing the towel against the
wound. She takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around
the towel and herself a couple more times, finally biting
through the tape and tossing the roll away.

65.
CONTINUED:
She yanks yesterday's clothes up, discards the skirt in
favor of a pair of black jeans. She tugs them up over
her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on over her top,
thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and
finally tugs on a black leather jacket. She goes to the
mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile looks with
the towel stuffed in her back -- but in the shattered
glass she can't really tell.
She turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands
are red with her own blood. She hurries to the sink,
rinses them off, and rinses the blood off of her face and
neck, then grabs her bag and heads for the door.
Once again she stops. She goes back, grabs the stiletto,
presses the stud and lets the blade slide back down, and
stuffs it into the pocket of her jacket. She heads out
the door.
CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, THE TRAIN
Amy is huddled in a corner seat, looking miserable,
scared, and slightly guilty. She looks down the length
of the subway car.
There are a few scattered riders -- a group of BLACK KIDS
at the far end of the train, a uniformed GUARD either on
his way to work or on his way home. A "post-punk" COUPLE
looking dull and heroin-pale. None of them look at her.
Amy hugs herself across the chest, looking as if she's
about to cry. Finally, she looks up as the train pulls
into a station.
The doors open and an OLD MAN comes through the door as
Amy rises from her seat and heads out. The Old Man looks
toward the seat recently vacated by Amy.
OLD MAN
Hey...
Amy turns and looks back. The seat and the floor beneath
it is stained with blood. Amy hesitates for only a second,
then turns and hurries out through the subway door just
before it closes.
CUT TO:
EXT., NIGHT, THE STREET
Amy is leaving bloody footprints as she walks, but there
is nobody on the street now to notice.

66.

EXT., NIGHT, THE FRONT OF MARLA'S BUILDING
Amy climbs the stairs,, checks the buzzers. There's
Marla's name. It hasn't been removed. She lifts her
finger to press the button. Before she touches it, a
prolonged buzz sounds. She turns toward the door and
shoves it open.
CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, THE HALLWAY OF MARLA'S APARTMENT
We see Amy moving up the stairs, turning the corner and
heading down toward Marla's apartment. The lock on the
door is still broken. Yellow police tape has been taped
across it. She tears the tape away, shoves the door open
and enters.
MARLA' S APARTMENT
She comes in, closing the door behind her and flips on
the light switch. It doesn't go on. Power is dead. She
moves in to the apartment. Lights from the city beyond
the window provides some marginal illumination. It is
essentially the same as she saw it the first time -except that the windows are now open and standing fans
have been placed there, now no longer spinning -presumably to remove the smell.
Amy then turns and heads down the corridor. She turns
the corner. The corridor is completely dark. If there
is something in the bathroom at the far end, it isn't
visible. Amy moves fast down the corridor to the
bathroom.
It is empty. The cord is still there, tied to the pipe,
but it's been cut.
Then, in the silence, there's a noise -- a brief sound of
movement. Amy turns toward the bedroom. She steps in.
INT., NIGHT, THE BEDROOM
The bed is there, visible in the indefinite light, empty.
But something is different. The quilted bedcover is
missing. Amy's eyes move left and right. No sign of
motion.
Then slowly, she moves to the other side of the bed -- to
the three-foot space between the bed and the far wall.
The quilted bedcover is piled up in the far corner, between
the bed and the wall.

67.
CONTINUED:
But something isn't quite right. It looks a bit too "full"
somehow. Amy stares at it, then slips the stiletto out
of her pocket.
She presses the stud.

The blade snicks out.

Then, slowly, the bedcover begins to move. Something
tugs it downward from within, and it slips down, revealing
Marla's eyes, peeking, child-like over the top. She's
still apparently wearing the green plastic rain coat.
If anything, the effects of decay seem to have advances.
There are ulcerations around her eyes. Her skin is
turning dark.
AMY
What the fuck did you do to me?
She brandishes the blade.
AMY
What!
Marla lowers the bedcover, revealing her face and neck.
Ulcerations are also growing around her mouth. The cord
is still tied around her neck. She reaches a hand out
from under the cover, scratches at it. We can see from
the marks on her throat, that she's been trying to get it
loose, without success. She reaches a hand out toward
Amy. Amy hesitates, then moves forward. Marla lifts her
head, revealing her throat. The cord is virtually buried
there.
AMY
No, no, no... bend your head down.
Marla bends her head down. Amy reaches out and brushes
her hair out of the way, revealing the cut-loose end of
the cord. She tugs it up and slides the edge of the knife
between the knot and Marla's swollen neck. As she works
it in, some nasty fluid begins to seep out of the sodden
flesh. She recoils at the smell.
Finally, Amy flicks the blade to the side, cutting through
the cord. Marla draws in a great, ragged gasp. But the
cord still sticks, and Amy must draw it slowly back, out
of the flesh of Marla' s neck. She tosses the cord away.
MARLA
(mumbling)
I'm sorry.

68.
CONTINUED:
AMY
What?
Marla looks up at her.
MARLA
I said I'm sorry.
AMY
You're sorry?
(almost laughing)
What the fuck is that? I'm bleeding
all over fucking lower Manhattan. It
was you, wasn't it? It was you who
did this?
MARLA
It's the way it's supposed to work.
The one who initiates you is the one
who has to be your guide.
AMY
This is the initiation?
somebody in the back?

Stabbing

MARLA
No... please, help me up...
She reaches out a swollen hand. Amy hesitates, then
reaches out and grabs it, tugging Marla up out of the
corner. She doesn't quite make it all the way up, but
slumps instead across the bed.
MARLA
That's the way it's supposed to work.
First the guide does it -- to make it
easier for you to believe. Then you
do it to yourself. I'm sorry. I'm
the wrong person to be explaining
this. I just thought... if I could
help you, maybe I could help myself.
AMY
Help me? You stabbed me. I'm
bleeding. I'm bleeding to death.
Marla pulls herself up. Amy, for a moment, goes to help
her, then decides against it. She steps back as Marla
turns and sits herself on the bed.
MAMA
Don't think that way. That gets you
into trouble. Witness... witness me.

69.
CONTINUED:
AMY
There's a hole in my back. My feet
make squishy sounds when I walk because
my shoes are full of blood...
MARLA
That doesn't matter...
AMY
What the fuck do you mean it doesn't
matter!
MARLA
Could you get me a glass of water?
AMY
Listen. Let me make this clear.
AM BLEEDING TO DEATH!

I

MARLA
Could you get me a glass of water?
Amy hesitates, then rushes out, goes into the bathroom.
Marla sits, relatively placid, while Amy fills a glass
and comes back. Marla takes it, lifts it to her lips,
slowly drinks. She lowers the glass to the bed, lets it
tip over onto its side.
MARLA
We shouldn't stay here.
AMY
I can't leave like this... I'm trailing
blood wherever I go. Somebody's going
to see. Somebody's going to stop us.
Us... how can you go anywhere?
MARLA
Where we're going, that doesn't matter
AMY
Where?
MARLA
You have to tell me. You know the
way. Now. Go on. We can't stay
here forever. This isn't a stable
situation.
AMY
It's not stable...

70.
CONTINUED:
MARLA
We've got to go. This place is too
solid. We can't hold on to it. I've
been drifting in and out all night.
I'm only here now because you want me
to be. Please...
AMY
But, I don't know...
MARLA
Help me, and I'll help you.

But we've

Abruptly, there's a sound like something cracking. Amy
turns toward the window. Outside, she can see the night
lights of the city -- but something strange has happened.
There's a crack in the window, but NOT in the glass.
It appears as if the world outside, in fact, has cracked,
and through the crack, the same city is visible, but a
city bright as noon. A brilliant sliver of daylight is
pouring through the crack, and it cuts across the bed
like a knife.
Marla jumps up and pulls away from, the light.
AMY
What is it?
MARLA
We're losing it...
She scrambles toward the bedroom door, pressing herself
up against the wall. There's another sound of cracking...
and then more, coming from the other room.
Marla makes no move.
past her.

Amy finally gets up and hurries

INT., THE LIVING ROOM
Amy comes around the corner and then freezes. The same
weird sight presents itself. The night world outside the
windows appears to be shattering, letting in splinters of
a daylit version of the city beyond.
But something even stranger appears to be happening,
because as the shafts of light cut diagonally across the
dark room, they appear to be illuminating sharp slices of
HUMAN FIGURES that are simply NOT THERE in the adjoining
shadows. Another crack appears, and another shaft of
light cuts across the room.

71.
CONTINUED:
The shard of light flickers through the spinning blades
of the fan -- but the "Night fan" -- clearly visible
surrounding it -- isn't spinning. It is only the
"daylight" version that appears to be in motion.
As the cracks grow, the floating shards of figures begin
to assemble into something recognizable. There's the
FIGURE of a POLICEMAN -- or, at any rate, we can glimpse
a slice of his uniform afloat in the air, another slice,
a bit lower, shows his hands holding a notebook, writing
something in it. Near him, we see slices of a second
figure, hovering in the shafts of light -- a black man.
We begin to hear dull echoes of voices, and we recognize
one of them -- the black man, in fact, is the Super who
let Amy in.
Another crack in the world beyond the window cuts a thin
shaft across his face. We hear his words, dully.
SUPER
(muted)
I'm a religious man, you know...
We see the disconnected sections of the Policeman turn,
his gesturing hand, drifting in and out of. View as it
moves in and out of the light that defines the borders of
its visible existence. His voice, too, comes out muted
and incomplete.
POLICEMAN
(muted)
Look, did... ...tually see a bod...
Amy continues to stare, mesmerized by this strange
phenomenon. She doesn't notice as Marla comes up
tentatively up behind her. She stands a few feet behind
Amy, who fails to notice her.
Finally, she reaches out a finger and taps her shoulder.
Amy jumps, turns.
MARLA
We have to go... we have to go ...
AMY
What's happening?
MARLA
Our thing only sticks in the shadows.
In the dark. You don't understand that
yet... and I can't hold onto it...
it's a my situation.

72.
CONTINUED:
AMY
What happens if we stay?
MARLA
In their world, in the daylight, a
knife in the heart is fatal. If you
stay, if you get sucked up in that
world, then you'll have to live by
their rules. The rules that make you
dead.
Amy turns on her, angrily.
AMY
Then why are you so anxious to leave -if what you want is to be dead?
MARLA
Because there's no version of me that
makes sense in their world any more. I
can't fit back in! What do you think I
was trying to do? Please. We've got
to go!
Behind them, the cracks in the "night" are growing,
filling the room with pools of painfully bright radiance.
Amy looks down toward the floor. She can see her own
bloody footprints in the shadows there. As she looks
another "crack" spills a bright slash of daylight across
the floor -- and in the light of day, her bloody
footprints are simply not there.
Another crack of light cuts across the floor, cutting one
of the footprints neatly in half -- visible in the
shadow, gone in the light.
AMY
Go how? What's outside the door?
Day or night? Where do we go?
MARLA
You have to decide.
Amy looks around the apartment, as if deciding what to
do.
AMY
(pause)
It's the bathroom, isn't it?
Marla doesn't answer. Amy turns and heads out of the
bedroom. She looks back toward Marla.

73.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Come on!
They turn and hurry toward the bathroom.
INT., NIGHT, THE BATHROOM
The two enter the dark space. Amy backs away as Marla
enters, coming unpleasantly close to her. She hesitates,
then closes the door. Behind it, set into the wail, there
is a narrow archway -- leading to a flight of scuffed
black steps, leading down into gloom.
AMY
Where does this lead?
MARLA
I don't know. I've never seen it
before.
AMY
Go on... you're the guide.
first.. .

You go on

Marla starts toward the arch. Abruptly, a "crack" forms
in the narrow bathroom window, sending a shard of light
cutting across the archway -- -- only in the "daylit"
strip, the archway and the open space beyond literally
aren't there.
What the strip of day light illuminates is simply a narrow
strip of white-tiled bathroom wall, perhaps six inches
wide. Marla pulls away, retreating from the light.
AMY
Hurry up, hurry up.
it...

Go underneath

Marla advances cautiously, then literally ducks underneath
the strip of "reality" and starts down the stairs. Amy
hesitates, reaching a hand out toward the illuminated
strip. But as soon as her hand passes into the range of
the light, her fingers change, turning grey, the nails
black -- the hand of somebody dead.
Gasping, she pulls her hand back, then she, too, starts
to duck underneath the illuminated strip. Another "crack"
and the strip widens -- now almost a foot of the archway
has become solid wall. Gasping, Amy ducks low, beneath
the light and the solid wall it illuminates, and heads
down the stairwell.
CUT TO:

74.

INT., NIGHT, THE STAIRWELL
These are steep and narrow, made of some dull, scuffed
black stone. The walls are unfinished, the flip side of
a lathe and plaster wall. Marla is waiting some distance
down the stairs.
Amy descends toward her. There is another "crack" from
above. She turns to look back the way she came.
From the "night" side, the odd phenomenon is reversed.
In the areas unlit from the bathroom side, the bathroom
is clearly visible.
But the areas lit from the far side appear to be physical
gaps, opening onto a literal continuation of the stairs,
running up into darkness. As Amy watches, the "cracks"
seem to compound.
Slash by slash, the bathroom vanishes from view, revealing
more and more of the "alternate" reality -- the night
reality, consisting of a stairway impossibly long, reaching
impossibly high.
Finally, with a dull boom, the final sliver of the bathroom
vanishes from view. Now only the endless stairway remains.
AMY
What...
MARLA
It's all daylight now, on the other
side. Wow. That was close. I was
worried...
AMY
Worried?
MARLA
Come on. Let's see where this thing
leads to...
Marla starts down the stairs.

Amy follows.

AMY
You really don't know?
Marla turns back, looks down toward Amy's feet, trailing
blood. Vaguely embarassed, Marla looks away, talking to
Amy as she precedes her down the stairs.

75.
CONTINUED:
MARLA
See... you see, that's the problem.
I'm supposed to help you. Like...
like Carl helped Sheila. Like Marybeth
helped me. But I don't know if I
can. You see, that's my trouble.
AMY
No, I don't see.
fucking thing.

I don't see one

MARLA
Okay. Analogy. It's like a tightrope
walker... you're walking along on
this rope, and everything's fine, and
then ail of a sudden, it's like your
realize -- fuck, I'm walking on a
fucking rope a hundred feet up in the
air. And that's when you fall. I
was in the room with the other deaders,
for my initiation. I put my head
through a noose and I jumped ten feet
down, and broke my neck, and crushed
my throat. And they cut me down, and
my friend Marybeth breathed into me,
and I was alive. She was my guide.
And my revivalist. She's so great,
you know? And everybody was happy...
and like, congratulating me...
AMY
Then what happened?
Marla pauses on the stairs. Amy stands behind her,
looking down at her, not knowing quite what to do. Then,
suddenly, Marla seems to fold up. She slides down and
lies curled up against the wall, sobbing. Amy doesn't
know quite what to do.
Finally, awkwardly, she slides down and sits as "next" to
Marla as she can, given that the stairs aren't wide enough
for them to sit two abreast. She reaches out a tentative
hand and touches her on the shoulder.
Clearly, Amy isn't used to doing this sort of thing even
for alive person, never mind a dead one.
AMY
Come on, come on... don't, you know...
don't be doing that.
(pause)
Marla... Marla... what happened to
you?

76.
CONTINUED:
Marla looks up, her face wet with yellowish tears.
MARLA
For awhile, everything was fine.
But..
(struggles to control
herself)
But I can't... I can't make myself stop
thinking that I'm dead. And I'm stuck.
So long as I'm thinking, I say to myself,
I can't be dead. You know, I think
therefore I am. But it's like, I think,
therefore I am -- fucked. Because I
can't stop thinking that I should be
dead. I tried to kill myself a second
time. Didn't work. How could it? How
could it? Already dead. So, what I'm
supposed to say is, in terms of the
bleeding... it can't kill you unless
you're sure that it has to.
AMY
Oh, come on, what the fuck does that
mean? How the hell am I supposed to
do th...
MARLA
Like I said. Wrong person to ask?
Right? Just... just think of it this
way...
Marla turns and stares up at Amy.
MARLA
You're sitting here talking to a
rotting corpse. An hour ago I stabbed
you in the heart, but you feel no
pain, and you're still walking around.
Isn't that a bit unusual? Don't you
find it difficult to reconcile this
state of affairs with your previous
view of reality? Why aren't you dead?
Why aren't I?
AMY
I don't know. I just don't know.
MARLA
Because, when it's dark enough, there's
no such thing. No difference between
dead and alive. Corpses can talk, people
can be stabbed in the heart and not
die.

MARLA (CONT'D)
You can turn into anything. Make
anything be anything. Where you can
blow your brains out and still be...
just fine. In the daylight, that can't
be. But in the night world, in this
world, it can. You see, it's easy to
say, but it's not easy to do. As... as
witness me.
AMY
Why am I bleeding like this?
MARLA
Don't you understand?
AMY
Stop asking me that!
Marla turns and starts down the stairs.

Amy follows.

MARLA
Fine. You're bleeding because you want
to be. You're the one who's in charge.
You've been in charge ever since you
saw me in the bathroom. Everything
that's happened to you... is the way
you wanted it to be. We all find our
own way. Sometimes it gets you
through. Sometimes it's a dead end.
Pardon the expression. This is the way
you've picked.
AMY
I didn't choose you to stab me in the
back.
MARLA
Yes, you did. Here's the final,
ultimate deal. It isn't enough for
somebody else to stick a knife into
you. That's just a passive thing it
still let's you have doubts. You
have to come to the point where you
can do it to yourself -- that's the
test. That's the acceptance. For a
second, I was there... like, I had no
doubts, for that second. But they
came back.
AMY
You have to know how to stop this
bleeding.

78.
CONTINUED:
MARLA
Oh, God. Bleeding, bleeding, bleeding.
(pause)
If you say so, maybe I do.
AMY
Well, then, stop it.
MARLA
Hey...
Marla hesitates, gestures downward. They've come to the
bottom of the stairs. A narrow door swinging door with a
circular window in it, let's in a shaft of artificial
light.
The sounds from the other side are oddly familiar -- the
clank of pots and pans, clinking glasses, the echoes of
VOICES.
It sounds like the kitchen of a restaurant.
AMY
What should we do?
there...

There are people

MARLA
Don't worry about that. That's not
daylight. We're still in the night
world. Nothing can hurt you here...
except yourself. As... um, as evidence

Marla moves down the stairs, with Amy trailing hesitantly
behind her.
AMY
There are people...
Marla looks back toward her, questioning.
AMY
I'm all bloody.
see me...

I don't want them to

Marla stares at her for a second, and then, frustrated,
gestures to herself... clearly, she's a much more frightful
sight. Then, without a word, Marla goes to the bottom of
the steps and starts through the door.
Amy moves toward her.

79.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Fear is where you go to learn?
MARLA
It's where you go... and sometimes
it's where you stay.
She doesn't wait for Amy, but pushes through. As the
door flaps back and forth, the sound grows loud and soft,
loud and soft. Amy, suddenly aware of her aloneness,
hurries after her. She shoves through the swinging door.
CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, THE KITCHEN
Amy pushes through the door and stops, staring at the
place, not knowing quite what to make of it. Through the
steamy air, Amy can see what looks, on the surface, like
the kitchen of a Chinese Restaurant.
Rows of metal counters, great steaming pots.
CHEFS and WAITERS move about, carrying trays of orders,
carrying food to be prepared. Others are cooking at great
blazing ovens, stirring who-knows-what in big woks, with
the splashes senting out great whooshes of fire.
Amy looks left and right, trying to find Marla. Finally,
she spots her, moving down a narrow corridor, squeezing
past Waiters and Chefs.
She's almost out of sight.
Amy moved forward at once, almost colliding with a gaunt
WAITER burdened with a tray covered with little covered
metal dish. As they bump, one of the silver covers on
one of the silver serving dishes jiggles, splattering
some red down the side of the dish.
Amy glances toward the Waiter, who glances at her with
glazed, dead eyes.
As the Waiter moves on, Amy turns and looks back down the
aisle. Marla is out of sight. She pushes forward, urgent,
circling around the various figures, leaving bloody
footprints on the floor behind her.
Ma... Marla!

AMY
Marla!

But there's no answer. She reaches an intersection, where
two aisle cross, she looks this way and that...

80.
CONTINUED:
The aisles seem to literally reach to the horizon, or at
least as far as she. Can see before they vanish into
steam.
Abruptly, something wet drips down onto her arm. It is
something thick, like reddish oil. She looks up.
Above her, strung in rows, like so many Peking Ducks, are
dead cats, hanging from strings, their skins shaved,
red-orange with whatever they've been cooked in.
There's a loud bang.

Amy turns.

On the far side of the Counter, she sees a row of CHINESE
CHEFS, all grossly overweight. They are wielding cleavers,
chopping something on the tables in front of them. We
don't see what, but their faces have a kind of fiendish
glee as they chop and chop, red and black splashing up
onto their white aprons.
As Amy stares at them more closely, she can see that these
Chefs are distinctly "wrong" -- some of them with visible
but bloodless wounds, others with glazed eyes, one with a
head that appears to be rather the wrong shape for a living
person's head.
Amy backs away, moving down one of the aisles.
turns... and sees Marla in the distance.

She

AMY
Marla!
She starts after her. Abruptly, a mouse goes flitting
across the floor. Amy jumps back. Then another one comes
running across. She looks up. One of the CHEFS is tending
one of those huge aluminum soup kettles.
He lifts the metal lid.
The kettle is literally full of mice, roiling like a kind
of ghastly living liquid. As he stirs the living mass,
the occasional escapee jumps out and goes flitting across
the floor.
She backs away, knocking some pots and pans off a shelf,
then turns and hurries in Marla's direction.
But once again her guide has vanished. She moves to the
next intersection, staring this way and that. No sign of
Marla -- and the ghastly kitchen still seems to go on
forever.
She glances back the way she came.

81.
CONTINUED:
Coming down the crowded corridor, following her bloody
trail, is a scrawny BUSBOY, pushing a broom, wiping up
her bloody footsteps, coming her way. He looks up at her
and smiles -- the inside of his mouth altogether too red
to be natural.
Be smiles, with his bloody mouth, nodding, and keeps on
coming, mopping up her bloody footsteps as he comes.
Amy turns and starts to run, no longer caring. Panting,
she shoves past a WAITER, knocking him over, and going
down with him. The platters go flying, along with their
contents.
One of the dishes spills its contents in front of her.
It is the face of a woman -- not a head, but just the
face, as if pealed neatly off the skull, surrounding by
Chinese vegetables, now spilled this way and that by the
fall.
The woman's hair is also, apparently in place... bright
dye-red hair, trailing down one side. The face is
Marybeth's. But taking the place of each eye, finishing
off the hideous "dish" -- a decorative carrot curl...
Amy has used up what terror she has.
starts crying.

She breaks down and

AMY
Please... please... I don't want to
be here. I don't want to be here...
She hears the sound of a mop being dunked in water. She
looks back. The Busboy with his mop is still coming,
still grinning.
Amy turns, glances underneath one of the metal tables.
She can look through to the far side, to the parallel
aisle. She sees Marla's high-heeled boots, clearly
nothing that anybody else in this place is wearing.
Marla!

AMY
Marla!

She scrambles up and starts down the aisle. She reaches
a cross-aisle and turns, heading back up the aisle where
she's seen Marla.
But this aisle, apparently, doesn't go on forever. In
fact, it ends in a culvert where a big floor-to-ceiling
freezer stands. And as the scene comes into view, Amy
sees a cluster of the grotesque CHEFS shoving Marla into
the freezer.

82.
CONTINUED:
She is struggling, her hands reaching.
AMY
Marla!
MARLA
Help... Amy...
But Marla can't stand against the Men. They shove her
in, start to close the door. Her pale swollen hand reaches
out. They push it in, get the freezer door closed.
Then they turn toward Amy.

She turns.

The Busboy with the mop and bucket is coming, washing up
her bloody footprints, smiling as he comes. Behind him,
others are coming, the demonic waiters and Chefs, hemming
her in.
Amy spots a carving knife on one of the preparation
tables. She grabs it, holds it out toward one of the
grossly fat CHEFS as he approaches. The Chef stares at
her with glazed eyes, then reaches forward and tugs up
his apron and undershirt, pulling them up over the great
expanse of his belly and chest, baring them.
There seem to be no fewer than a dozen knives thrust in -the handles have been broken off, leaving merely the naked
metal edges, almost flush to the skin, to mark where
they've been plunged in.
Amy stands, holding the weapon, now clearly a useless
thing. Slowly, inch by inch, she lets her hand fall,
until the knife tumbles out. She looks down and sees the
mop, coming toward her. She looks up, into the face of
the blood-mouthed Busboy. He smiles.
Now hands are reaching for her. She tries to shove them
away, but in a moment she's overwhelmed, lifted up.
The Busboy stands, leaning on his mop, the same smile on
his face, watching as the crowd carries Amy off down the
aisle, crying, making wordless panicked sounds,
struggling, squirming in their grip.
The Busboy looks down. There's a trail of blood drops.
He dips his mop in the bucket and follows, cleaning up as
he goes.
CUT TO:

83.
CONTINUED:
THE HEAT LOCKER
At any rate, it's someplace where carcasses of various
kinds are suspended from the ceiling by books. Amy is
there now, also hanging upside down in the near-dark, her
hands bound behind her back, her ankles tied together.
The bindings between her ankles are strung onto the nasty
metal hook that holds her a couple feet up off the
ground.
She looks to one side. Near her, hanging from another
hook, is something that literally looks like a white
leopard. But now, though alive, it's barely moving, its
white fur stained red.
Further on, other things, some animal, some human, others
unrecognizable, are hanging from the various hooks.
There's a clank and the metal door opens.

He takes a

AMY
Wait... wait.
But the Chef pays no more attention to her words than he
would to the squawking of a goose. He takes her by the
hair, turns her head to the side, and calmly draws the
knife diagonally across the side of her neck, opening up
the arteries.
Amy screams as the blood begins to come out, running down
her neck, into her hair, spilling into the bowl.
AMY
No, no, please... no, I don't want to
be here. I don't want to be here!
But the Fat Chef pays her no mind. He comes back up to
standing with a grunt, turns, and inspects the hanging
body of the leopard. Apparently finding it satisfactory,
he reaches up and unhooks it. Draping the barely alive
thing across his huge back, he heads out the door.

84.
CONTINUED:
Amy struggling weakly, hears the door close with a metallic
bang.
CUT TO:
INT., THE MEAT LOCKER
Some time later. We can hear a slow, irregular drip. We
MOVE through the nightmarish place of death until we find
its source -- the basin beneath Amy's head.
As we watch, a final drop of blood lands in it, and the
ripples come to stillness. Above, Amy is there, still
hanging, still alive, but hardly aware of her
surroundings.
There's a sound of movement, a metallic clanking, like a
padlock being locked, and them a shadow falls across Amy.
She moves her head slightly.
It's Marla. She bends down low, so that her face is close
to Amy's. We don't know how much time has passed or where
she's been, but the effects of decay seem even more
pronounced. The eye lids on one of her eyes doesn't seem
to be working any more, and the eye on that side sags
unpleasantly.
Okay. Okay.

MARLA
I think we're making

Wh-what...
MARLA
You wanted the bleeding to stop.
It's stopped. I mean, it's kind of a
weird way to do it...
AMY
No, no, no, no... oh Christ. Oh,
fucking Christ... I don't want to be
here...
MARLA
Me either. This is some fucked up
place. I mean, really.
AMY
I just want to go home, I just want
to go home, please...

85.
CONTINUED:
MARLA
Don't think that. Personally, I think
that was a big mistake, trying to keep
my apartment.
AMY
What...
MARLA
It was like, I wanted to be part of
this big, black mystery, this crazy
night nirvana thing -- but I didn't
want to give up my apartment. I
thought I could keep a foot in the
daylight, you know what I mean. I'm
speaking metaphorically. But I don't
think that really works. You can't
be a thing of the night and, like...
pay rent and stuff. I think that
contributed to, like, my major
confusion and this whole situation...
Amy meanwhile, has started to cry, though at first it's a
bit hard to tell whether she's sobbing or laughing. Marla
just sits, a bit uncomfortable. She fidgits, feeling at
the corner of her sagging eye.
MARLA
Come on, it's... I don't know.

It's

AMY
Tell me. Tell me... is it a dream?
Am I dreaming?

It's the wrong question.

Don't go there, Amy. That's a dead
end. You can't get where you need to

Going where?

AMY
Going where?

MARLA
Look, there's no dreaming, there's no
waking, no crazy, no sane. Nothing
like that...
AMY
That's it... I've got to be... I've
got to be losing my mind...
MARLA
No, it's not your mind you want to
lose...
There's the sound of motion, like approaching footsteps.
MARLA
Listen, we should go.
AMY
Go?
Now we see the latch on the door being tried -- and we
also see a padlock holding the door closed.
MARLA
I padlocked the door. Now we need to
go. You need to find the way out...
Now there's thumping at the door as whatever it is on the
other side tries to knock it down.
MARLA
Amy...
AMY
Crazy, it's crazy... I don't have any
blood in me... he cut my throat.
MARLA
That doesn't matter.
AMY
He cut my throat!
This is not real!

I'm not kid...

You stabbed me!

CONTINUED:
MARLA
Stop saying that!
There's a sound like the awkward ringing of a bell as
something metal shatters.
Amy turns toward the door.
One of the hinges has shattered and the latch itself,
through which the padlock has been threaded, is half-pulled
from the door frame.
There's another bang. The metal freezer door moves,
falling slightly out of the frame.
AMY
I don't believe it.

I don't believe

MARLA
Amy, you've got to stop thinking that.
Now we see distorted hands reaching around the borders of
the door. Fat swollen fingers, thin withered ones, the
black-nailed hands of children, which scrabble at the
padlock, trying to tug it free.
AMY
You're not here.

You're not real...

MARLA
Please stop saying that.

Please.

AMY
I know it. I know it. This can't be
real. None of this. I don't believe
in it...
The heavy door starts to squeak and pop hideously as the
force of weight on the other side begins to bend it in
the middle.
Now whole arms are sliding through, grabbing at the door.
Marla turns to look, then looks back toward Amy.
MARLA
Please, Amy, please don't do this.
Please don't leave me here...
AMY
Go away, go away. I'm not going anywhere with you.

Abruptly, the door heaves forward and we see what's on
the other side. The hands and arms are not connected to
separate beings, but are stitched together into some
impossible Hydra-like thing, arms threaded together into
a single mass like so many snakes. The air fills with a
horrible wet tearing sound as it moves forward.
No!

Amy's eyes

She's lying on a white pillow, with white sheets tucked
up over her. She turns her eyes to one side. There's a
hospital curtain, the kind on a railing, pulled closed
around her. She looks down.
She's lying in a hospital bed. An IV needle is in her
arm. The sound of other voices, speaking quietly nearby -apparently she's in a ward of some kind.
She looks in the other direction.

LARRY
Good morning.
She doesn't answer.
LARRY
How are you?
Abruptly, Amy's hand springs up to her throat, feeling
for a wound. Nothing. She puts her hand to her chest.
Abruptly, the curtain tugs aside a bit and Bud enters,
carrying two coffees.
BUD
Hey, what are you doing? Checking to
see if you're still alive.
AMY
Yes.
BUD
Ooo-kay.

He hands a cup to Larry.
BUD
Sorry, I thought you were still in
bad-brain-chemical land. I'd have
brought you a coffee.

Larry holds out his. Amy holds her hand up to say no.
As she does, she sees that there are reddish cinch marks
on her wrists. She stares at them.
AMY
Larry, what the fuck happened?
LARRY
We didn' t hear from you. Don't you
remember? Bud and I went over to
your place. You were lying on the
floor...
BUD
Yeah, covered in every kind of stuff
that can come out of a human body...
AMY
The blood...
Okay.

BUD
Every other kind.

AMY
I don't remember.
LARRY
You were sort of...
BUD
You were having a psychotic episode,

What do you think those marks are?
You were tied down for a day and half.

Hey, Larry, Larry... this is the best

Well, there you go. A whole new

They found her dead in her apartment.
She hanged herself.

They found her.

You mean the police?

LARRY
Yeah. She'd been there awhile.

I mean, about it being suicide.
AMY
Where is she?
LARRY

AMY
No, I guess not.

Larry, did I call and tell you I was

LARRY
No. No, you didn't, actually. But
it's a moot point. We're not going
to do the story. Okay?
AMY
Yeah.
BUD
But it's okay, because this is a good
story too. Call it, "My Psychotic

AMY
Bud, do me a favor...
BUD
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, there's a
lot of raw material around here.
Emphasis on the word "raw." Maybe
they'll let you use a felt-tip pen or
something to take notes.

He leans over, gives her a little peck on the cheek.

He stands, winks at her.
LARRY
You going to be all right?
AMY
Yeah.
LARRY
I'll see you in a little bit.
BUD
When you get a chance, check out the
public area. It's a swinging place.
I mean, like, they're literally...
swinging.
They head out.

Larry turns back.

LARRY
Oh, I brought these for you.
He reaches into his pocket and comes out with her sun
glasses. He puts them on the table by her bed. Larry
smiles, turns and follows after Bud.
The Orderly moves in closer.
ORDERLY
I'm going to sit you up...
He puts down the railing on one side of the bed, helps
her sit up and swing her legs out over the side of the
bed. He puts one of those disposable thermometer things
in her mouth, takes her pulse.
AMY
What day is today?

93.
CONTINUED:
Hmm?

ORDERLY
Thursday.

Be takes the thermometer, writes some stuff down on the
chart.
AMY
Means nothing to me.
ORDERLY
Doctor Magid'll be here in a minute...
AMY
Thanks.
The Orderly puts the chart on the bed and heads out. Amy
sits for a moment, turns, looks out a nearby window
through which a bright, if rather seedy, day-lit view of
the city is visible.
Something flickers by in her field of view. She glances
down, toward the lowered railing. A fly is there. It
meanders along the rail. Amy reaches out and waves her
hand near it, to shoo it away.
But it doesn't go.
She waves her hand again. The fly ignores her. She brings
her hand closer. The fly abruptly buzzes off the railing
and lands on the back of her hand. Amy stares at it for
an instant, then brings her other hand down on top of the
fly with a slap...
Or is it a slap?
The sound seems somehow louder than it should, and
strangely familiar. A kind of crack -- like the cracks
that let the light of day into Marla's apartments.
Amy freezes at the familiar sound. Then, hesitantly, she
takes her hand away. There's no fly on the back of her
hand. She turns the other hand around. No fly in the
palm. No sign of it.
AMY
No, please... please...
Then there's another crack. She jumps, turns toward the
table by the side of the bed.
Nothing particularly sinister about it -- but something
different. There's a strip of shadow across it, passing
close to her folded sunglasses.

94.
CONTINUED:
She reaches her hand cautiously out toward the shadow.
Abruptly, there's another "crack" and another shadow
abruptly falls across her sunglasses.
Now it becomes clear that this isn't merely a shadow, but
the bizarre inverse of the effect she witnessed before.
Where the new sliver of shadow crosses her sunglasses,
they appear shattered. In the light -- intact, in the
shadow, broken.
It is the "night" world leaking in.
Hanging in the bright air, in fact, Amy can see the
"shafts" of darkness, like shafts of light, coming from
the direction of the window.
She turns toward the window.
She can see the splinters of darkness, the reverse of
what she saw before, revealing slivers of a "night world"
beyond the window, utterly different from the daylit
world that now dominates.
She rises, moves toward the window, then stops, realizes
that she's still attached to the IV. She reaches out,
tears the bandage away and then, with a hiss, extracts
the needle.
There's another crack, and another, wider fissure cuts
across the window. She moves forward, breathing fast,
making sure to avoid the shafts of darkness.
She comes close to the wall with the window. It is part
of a long, open passage, lined with windows, like the one
she's standing before, spaced at intervals along its
length, facing the curtained beds. A lone, ELDERLY WOMAN,
in a hospital gown, is standing some distance down, her
back to the wall, some figure lost in her own world.
There is another crack, and another "fissure" in the
outside world opens up, sending a shaft of darkness into
the room. Now she hears other, more distant cracks and
pops and when she looks down the hall, she realizes that
the "night" is leaking in down its entire length.
A distant sound, like the sound of a subway train, comes
to her ears. She moves forward, leaning to the side, and
glances up, through one of the wider gaps.

95.
CONTINUED:
OUT THE WINDOW
Through the dark gap in reality, she can see an urban
landscape completely unlike the one visible in the daylit
world.
An Elevated Train is roaring by above her, making a nasty
clatter as it strikes some loose spot and sends out a
lightning-bright electric spark at regular intervals as
it passes.
In the windows, she can glimpse inhuman shapes, but they
roar by too fast, and are seen too distantly to make them
out with any certainty. What she can be sure of is that
the sparks from the passing train are casting their light
upward -- revealing the shadowed areas above the El and
the low, brick buildings that crowd it.
And above them both, impossibly -- there is a roof, made
of girders and stained rotting concrete, not merely
covering the train, but somehow encompassing the entire
visible night world.
She gasps.

Abruptly, a voice sounds behind her.

Miss Klein?

MAGID
Miss Klein?

Amy turns abruptly. DR. MAGID, a young Indian Doctor, is
standing by the bed. The bands of growing darkness are
cutting across him. In the light of day, he is simply a
familiar figure dressed in a white Doctor's coat.
But in the shadowed areas, we glimpse things more
sinister. Where it falls across his clothing we see a
coat stained with blood and filth. Where it falls across
the side of his face, we can glimpse flesh pale and
festering.
AMY
Please, please help me.

It's coming

MAGID
What is coming?
AMY
The night... please, don't let it
take me. I want to stay here...
There's another crack.
aside.

Amy lets out a shriek and jumps

96.
CONTINUED:
Now the new sliver of night falls more widely on the
Doctor's face, revealing more of the nightmarish "dead"
version -- an ear all but gone, hair matted with black
stuff.
AMY
Oh, God, don't let me go.
Then the Doctor takes a step -- and comes almost completely
out of the shadow areas that he, clearly, does not see.
He speaks in a calming, confident voice, the kind of
calculatedly gentle voice that comes from long experience
with the insane.
MAGID
Miss Klein, nothing is going to take
you away. Please, come back to bed.
Come. Take my hand. I promise, we
will not hurt you.
He holds out his hand, coming no closer. Amy hesitates,
then moves away, ducking underneath one of the shafts of
darkness. She reaches her hand out in little halting
jerks. Magid remains calm, impassive.
MAGID
I'm just going to give you an
examination, and then we'll talk.
All right...
AMY
Yes...
MAGID
Come, just sit down here...
She reaches out her hand, touches his, hesitant, then
takes it. He tightens his grip. Then, suddenly, there's
a loud crack and a vertical fissure of darkness opens up
in the window behind them. The shaft of darkness cuts
between them, falling on their hands.
Only now, in the darkness from the night world, the hand
that holds her is a ghastly wet thing -- and her hand, in
the darkness, is pale, bruised, splattered with blood.
The hand starts to pull her... only now Amy is pulling
away. She looks up, into the calm face of Dr. Magid. He
speaks, but now his voice comes out distorted. She cannot
understand the words.
Instead, the sound of the Elevated Train is coming again,
louder. She turns, looks toward the window.

97.
CONTINUED:
The night world is gaining dominance -- and down the hall,
the windows are a patchwork of day and night. Another
train comes rumbling by outside. Amy looks.
THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE TRAIN
We see the faces of things dead, things not human at all.
Amy feels a sudden tug. She looks back. A band of
darkness abruptly cuts across the lower part of Magid's
face. The bland gentle face is suddenly replaced, within
the night-lit world, with a chinless, gaping mouth, lined
with tiny baby-shark teeth. It speaks, but this voice,
though wet and whispery, we now hear clearly.
THE SHARK MOUTH
Help me, Amy Klein. Help me...
AMY
Help... help you...
She tries harder to pull away, but her bare feet slip on
the floor. The Shark Mouth gapes, as if trying to swallow
air. And, impossibly, above it, somehow connected to it
in some weird way, is the face of Magid, now starting to
look a bit alarmed.
THE SHARK MOUTH
You know Marla... I'm a friend of
hers.
AMY
What?
Amy looks down. The hand is pulling her harder. She
struggles to break free, but the grip of the wet, nasty
hand is unbreakable.
THE SHARK MOUTH
Maybe she mentioned me...
AMY
No!

No!

Finally, Amy hauls back and punches, back-handed, at the
twin faces.
Her hand hits something -- but it is not the Shark Face
that vanishes. Rather, the impact of her fist literally
seems to knock Magid out of view, and in a single ripping
instant, the day-lit world has vanished, as if torn away
by her action.

98.
CONTINUED:
Now, the corridor is all darkness, except for strange
lights behind the curtains, and the shadows of strange
things moving in the lights, cast up on the curtains.
But Amy has more immediate concerns. With Magid torn
away, the full features of the SHARK THING are now visible.
It seems to have no rigidly fixed shape. Rather, its
face and form, almost like liquid, flow back and forth,
sometimes more like a shark, sometimes more like a
scrawny twenty-year old, sometimes other things, perhaps
the shadows of other living things, bristle out on his
face, or beneath his clothing, and vanish.
Amy, now, has also reverted to her "night" form -- back
in the same ragged black garments she wore before,
bruised, her hair clotted with blood, the horrid knife
cut in her throat. She gasps as the Shark Thing hauls
her close.
SHARK THING
Are you sure she didn't talk about
me? I'm Bobby...
AMY
Bobby... you... the one who got lost...
Lost?

SHARK THING
Is that what happened?

Is it?

AMY
She was afraid she'd end up like you.
Lost. That's... that's what she said.
SHARK THING
Where is she?
AMY
I don't know.
SHARK THING
Right. Right. So SHE'S lost. I'm
not lost. I'm right here, with the
others.
(leans close)
And with you...
Abruptly, he slides a ghastly arm around her shoulder and
turns her.

99.
CONTINUED:
SHARK THING
And, if, if you can save her, why not
me? Be my guide... find your way
out... and I'll follow.
AMY
I don't even know where I am...
The Shark Thing begins to laugh, a weird wet laugh.
thrusts his face into hers.

He

SHARK THING
I don't even know THAT I am. It's
one great fucking mystery, only it's
got no last page. It just keeps
getting more and more fucking
mysterious, until you can't even
remember where one things leaves off
and another begins.
He leans in close to her. And then, suddenly, it's as if
the two literally begin to melt together. Amy screams,
and it echoes, unnaturally loud, down the long corridor.
She twists wildly, and literally tears loose from the
Shark Thing, tumbling to the ground, her clothing torn
around the shoulder, back and side, her skin exposed,
weirdly raw.
She grabs a wheeled IV holder and flings it toward the
Shark Thing. As it hits, she turns, stumbles, and starts
running down the corridor. The IV pole has buried itself
in the Shark Thing's shoulder, as if in clay. He tears
it lose and throws it to the ground.
SHARK THING
She knows the way out! She knows the
way! Follow her!
As Amy runs, suddenly, the curtains start to tear open,
behind her, next to her, in front of her, and THINGS come
loping out. Some rotted, like Marla, some much worse,
little more than skeletons.
Other THINGS, incomplete, like human beings melted like
plastic, or in pieces, cut apart and glued back together.
And still others, like the Shark Thing, weird, halffinished amalgams of Human and Other.
AMY
I don't know! I don't know anything!
The Shark Thing comes loping after her.

CONTINUED:
BOBBY
Liar! Liar! Where's Marla!

She

Amy stops, finding herself face to face with a brokennecked Horror, dives to the floor, and scampers under it.
Other things paw at her, some with rotting fingers,
others with animal paws, or wet tendrils. She dives to
the side, clambering over the beds, tearing the curtains
aside as the awakened things come after her. Abruptly,
she finds that one of the curtains is literally clinging
to her, wrapping itself around her. Gasping, she grabs
it and tears. The thing, whatever it is, is alive, and
as it tears we see tissue tear wetly, blood weave out it
screams as she flings it away.
But the mob is clearly crowding her, threatening to
overwhelm her. They press her forward until she comes to
the far wall.
AMY
Get away! I don't know where Marla is!
I can't help you! Leave me alone! Get
away!
She comes to a narrow door, she grabs for the knob, tries
to pull it open against the press of people. Suddenly,
she spots the Shark Thing, trying to make its way through
the undead press. Abruptly, she points at him.
He knows!
He knows!

AMY
Bobby knows!

Follow him!

Abruptly, eyes turn toward the Shark Thing. It is only a
brief confusion, some ignoring her words, others pressing
back toward Bobby, but it gives Amy the moment she needs.
She hauls the door open and throws herself in, pulling it
shut behind her.
INT., THE CLOSET
Her fingers find the little latch and she turns it, locking
the door -- but as she turns, she realizes that this is
the deadest of dead ends -- a closet barely three feet
deep and three feet wide, and those three feet are
cluttered with mops and detergent and god-knows-what.
She presses her hands against the door, and her back
meets the back of the closet -- not even enough room for
her to hold her arms out straight in front of her.

101.
CONTINUED:
She can hear the sounds of the Things on the other side,
scratching, hammering. She watches the door move as they
pull at the door knob, trying to get in.
Abruptly, there's a sudden loud roar and something huge
and white, like a white tiger comes literally out of
nowhere, shoving her against the side of the closet with
its huge paws on her shoulders... Or was it a tiger?
In an instant, the paws are hands, and the ferocious
white furred face is replaced by a familiar one. It's
Winter. He leans in close -- what else can he do in this
narrow space?
WINTER
I hate repeating myself, Amy Klein.
You're more trouble than you're worth.
AMY
I... I...
WINTER
Don't say anything. Whatever you say,
it's wrong. Don't ask any questions.
Don't look for any answers. There's a
kind of fire that you can't steal and
carry back to the world. All you can
do, is let yourself be consumed by it.
Burnt up, so that there's no you left.
Only the fire. Now listen to me.
There's a Way that I've made. You're
on it. Make no mistake. It is no more
real than I am, or that you are. I
made it to bring people to me that are
congenial to my sensibilities. Nothing
more. Those that are... come through.
Those that can't get through, or who
can't hold on -- end up here. Forever.
But now you've created a problem for
me. I've made the Way, and I can't
break it, without disrupting
everything I've made for myself. But
the Way requires that the initiates,
like you, have a Guide. But, as you
may have noticed, you've misplaced
your Guide.
AMY
Where is sh...
Winter shoves Amy hard against the wall.

102.
CONTINUED:
WINTER
I said, "Don't ask any questions."
Now, here is what I'm going to do, to
remedy this situation. If she's lost,
she can't guide you, she can't witness
your initiation, and she can't revive
you. So you must find her. You find
her by wanting to. I have decided that
you two are now one. I've said it.
That makes it so. You find her, wake
her up. When you initiate yourself,
she will witness it, and she will
believe and be reborn, and then SHE
will revive YOU. If you can't do what
you need to do, then the both of you
can stay here forever. That's all.
That's all I'm willing to do. Anything
more will wreck my whole night world,
and you're not worth it. One final
thing. To get where you're going you
have to leave everything behind.
Everything.
I know.

AMY
Even myself.

WINTER
(pause)
Maybe you'll be decent company after
all. There are advantages to
nothingness, Amy Klein. But it's not
for everybody.
Winter takes a step back -- strange considering that
there's no room to do it -- and folds into the wall. Amy
is alone. There is silence now. The door is still. She
looks at it, then turns toward it, unlocks in and shoves
it open. The Ward is gone. Now there is a flight of
wide marble steps leading down into darkness.
INT., THE STEPS
She comes out of the closet and stands on the upper
landing. Then she calmly begins to undress, tossing aside
her bloody clothing. She tears through the duct tape
that holds the now-useless towel to the wound-in her back.
It comes away sticky. She drops it, steps out of her
panties, black with dried blood.
She stands, naked, her body covered with bruises and
stained with blood.

103.
CONTINUED:
Then she starts down the stairs, her bare feet making
echoing slaps on the cold marble. She comes to the
bottom. There are double swinging doors there, with
circular windows in them -- unpleasantly like the door
that opened onto the nightmare Chinese kitchen. She moves
forward and pushes through.
INT., NIGHT, THE MORGUE
That's what this place is, apparently. The room is spare
and metallic. Rows of drawers stand against a far wall.
There are no bodies out. Everything is neatly tucked
away.
She crosses to one of the drawers. There is no
hesitation. She grabs it and pulls it out. There's a
great buzzing of flies as Marla, still in her green
plastic raincoat and underwear, comes sliding out. But
now she looks dead. Really dead -- and really dead for
awhile. The flies have laid their eggs, and the eggs
have made maggots, and the maggots are doing their work
on her face and on the exposed parts of her body.
Her eyes are open, but sunken, the orbs all gray. Amy
leans down close to her. She speaks in a quiet voice.
AMY
Marla, it's Amy.
Marla doesn't stir.

Wake up.

Amy bends down even closer.

AMY
Marla. Wake up. You're not dead, and
you can't stay here. Marla. Wake up...
Now Amy's lips are almost touching Marla's dead ones.
Then they do touch. Amy brushes her lips against Marla's,
then kisses her lightly.
Marla.

AMY
I need you.

Wake up.

Amy hesitates an instant, waiting, then kisses her more
deeply.
AMY
Wake up.
Then, with a wet sticky sound, Marla's eyes turn.
see Amy. Her lips move.

They

104.
CONTINUED:
AMY
You know me. You're my guide. Tell
me what to say. Tell me what to do.
Come with me. I've come to learn...
and I'm not afraid any more.
Marla's lips begin to move as she struggles to speak.
The words begin to come out, little more than breath.
MARLA
M-m-my skin...
AMY
My skin...
MARLA
...isn't real.
AMY
...isn't real.
MARLA
My eyes... aren't real.
AMY
My eyes aren't real.
MARLA
My muscles...
Now Amy begins to speak over her, sometimes coming in a
bit late, synchronizing the litany.
AMY
My muscles...
MARLA AND AMY
... aren't real. My bones, my heart,
heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh
and meat... aren't real.
MARLA
What I see, what I hear, what I taste,
what I touch, what I remember, what I
think, what I feel...
AMY
What I see, and hear, and taste, and
touch. What I remember, what I think,
what I feel... aren't real.
MARLA
Aren't real.

105.
CONTINUED:
But now Marla's final words, this time following Amy's
come in a much stronger voice. Amy looks down at her.
She seems to have shifted into an odd state. Her prior,
intact self is there, but the deader version flickers
across her skin like sparks, no longer dominant, but
still there. She sits up. Amy stares at her.
AMY
I'm not real...
Abruptly, the room is now no longer empty. There are
familiar figures there. Carl, Marybeth. Sheila. And
Winter, standing in the background.
WINTER
Go on.
AMY
I'm not real...
Marla slides off of the sliding table.
climb up. She lies down.

Hands help Amy

AMY
I'm not real...
Sheila comes up to Marla and places the .45 -- the big
gun, in Marla's hand. Marla turns and places it in Amy's.
AMY
I'm not real.
She places the gun to her head.
kisses her.

Marla leans over and

MARLA
You'll be back.
Amy stares at her, smiles.
We MOVE IN in an instant as her finger tugs the trigger.
No hesitation. But there is no sound of an explosion.
Instead, we -CUT TO:
INT., NIGHT, STATIC
Instead of the sound of a gunshot, we suddenly find
ourselves lost in some bright flickering space, filled
with the sound of static.

106.
CONTINUED:
Abruptly, the static vanishes, the flickering space
congeals and we realize that we are watching a
television screen.
And as we PULL RACE, we realize that we are seeing the
original footage, showing the death of Sheila. It's Bud's
office, late at night. He's there, in the dark, watching
the tape.
He weighs the remote control loosely in his hand. The
door opens and Larry comes in. He watches Bud for a
moment. Bud, for his part, doesn't even seem to notice
that he's there.
LARRY
I was just over at the 14th Precinct.
You know, I know Tommy McKay, he's a
detective over there...
BUD
So ...
LARRY
So, nothing. She's just gone. Left
her apartment, left her clothes, left
her money. No sign of her anywhere.
See no Amy.

BUD
Hear no Amy...

LARRY
Just like with Marla Chen. Apartment
just left empty. No trace. No trace
of her for six weeks, since she sent
us that tape. No trace of Amy for a
month.
BUD
So you think they met with foul play.
LARRY
Amy's not going to run off and join a
cult. Marla was a traitor for sending
us that tape. I'm sure they're both
dead. They were taken somewhere and
killed. There's no other explanation.
BUD
Too bad. It would have made a hell of
a story. Still would, if I could find
somebody else crazy enough to do it.
Yeah.

LARRY
Well... I'm quitting.

107.
CONTINUED:
Bud keeps watching the tape.

He doesn't answer.

LARRY
I said, I' m qui.. .
BUD
What do you want me to do? Give you
an argument? So you're quitting.
Good bye.
LARRY
(pause)
You ought to stop watching that thing,
man. It's getting to be a bad habit.
BUD
Your concern for my welfare is greatly
appreciated as always, Larry. See
you around.
Larry turns and walks out the door.
hears a voice.

As he closes it, Bud

AMY
Hey there, Bud.
Bud jumps, turns. Amy is sitting on the couch, dressed
as she was when we first saw her, and wearing her black
sunglasses.
BUD
Jesus fucking Christ, Amy. How the
hell did you get in here? And where
the fuck have you been? You know, some
people have been looking for you.
AMY
Don't worry, Bud.
BUD
Who said I was?
AMY
Why are you watching the tape, Bud?
BUD
Hmm?
AMY
Why are you watching the tape? What
do you think you're going to see?

108.
CONTINUED:
BUD
Shit, I... I don't know. What the
hell's the matter with you?
But Amy doesn't speak. She just watches him from behind
the opaque disks of her sunglasses.
BUD
I sent you out to find out what the
fuck I was seeing.
AMY
Don't be afraid, Bud.
BUD
I'm not afraid. It's just a fucking
piece of video tape. Fine, you don't
want to look, fine...
He grabs for the remote control. It goes flying off the
little table and lands on the floor in between the two.
They both bend over, reach down for it. As they do, Amy's
sunglasses fall onto the floor. Bud hesitates, then picks
up the remote. Amy remains in her bent over position.
AMY
I meant, don't be afraid of me.
BUD
What?
AMY
Don't be afraid.

I'm not real.

BUD
What do you...
Bud looks up.

And Amy starts to raise her head.
BUD

What...
Bud looks, and freezes, his eyes wide.
AMY
I said, Bud... don't be afraid.
not real...

I'm

And as she utters the final words, she turns her head up.
We see what Bud has already seen.

109.
CONTINUED:
The eyes revealed by the falling of the sunglasses are
simply not there at all. They are simply holes,
stretching into the empty blackness of Amy skull.
AMY
I'm not real...
FADE OUT
