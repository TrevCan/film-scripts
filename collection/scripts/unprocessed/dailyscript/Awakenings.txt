1. A dusty deserted street - saloon, livery stable, sunset.
Only there is something unsettling about it all. The colors
are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective. Pulling
slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden
picture frame ...
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1930
Drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room.
Across Venetian blinds, open, letting in moonlight, across
intricate handmade wooden models, dime novels and comic books,
across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and forth,
and settling finally on a small hand writing slowly and
deliberately, over and over, in synchronization, it seems, to
the rhythm of the metronome, the word, " L E O N A R D . "
2.

INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING - 1930

The pendulum of a clock. An adult hand placing a bowl of
cereal on a table. Leonard, ten or eleven, waits a moment for
the adult to leave, grasps his spoon, and manipulates it from
bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular rhythm of the
clock.
3.

EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - MORNING - 1930

3.

Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders, Leonard and another boy
his age, a classmate, move along a street.
All around them are "visual rhythms" - lines in the sidewalk,
the even placement of trees, the sunlight breaking through the
branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the rhythmic
pounding of an elevator train.
As they climb a fence, a pocket watch, Leonard's, falls to the
ground.
4.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - 1930

An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard.
Children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson.
All but one. Leonard. Whose hands are trembling slightly and
whose paper is blank. There is a noticeable lack of rhythms.
A cold silence. The broken watch rests on his desk.
The boy from the train, glancing at Leonard, begins gently
tapping the end of his pen against his desk. Leonard, "guided"
by the cadence of his friend's tapping, begins to write.

4.

(o

The teacher's hand at the blackboard hesitates. Distracted by
the rhythmic noise, he traces it to the offender and silences
him with a look.
\
'
Without the rhythm, and without, apparently, inner natural
rhythms to replace it, Leonard's hand begins dragging the pen
across the paper, forming vague scrawl, each word less defined
than the last, until they begin melding together into what
resembles nothing so much as a child's rendering of ocean
waves.

4.

The teacher resumes chalking on the board. The boy from the
train begins tapping his pen again, and, "guided" again by the
rhythm, Leonard is able to give definition to the "ocean
waves," to form recognizable letters.and words.
The teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the
irritating noise. The boy stops tapping and Leonard's writing
again becomes formless.
5. INT. CLASSROOM.- LATER - DAY - 1930

o

5.

The finished poem on the blackboard. The sounds of children at
play on the schoolyard. The teacher, alone in the classroom,
at his desk grading the penmanship lesson.
He circles offending errors on the last page of the last
composition book. He scribbles a grade opposite the student's
name in a grade book. He notices the absence of a grade in
Leonard's column.
.
Leonard's desk. The teacher locates the missing composition
book buried under textbooks. He takes it back to his own desk,
opens it, and stares curiously at the last lesson, the poem, or
rather Leonard's illegible representation of it.
He considers earlier lessons in the book. He begins to see in
the script a pattern of deterioration. He reaches the last
entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning
In "the waves."

6.

INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - DAY - 1930 - WINTER

The painting on the wall. The intricate wooden models and dime
novels. The Venetian blinds, closed, shutting out sunlight.
Voices, barely audible, from somewhere else in the house:
BOY'S VOICE
When can I see him?
WOMAN'S VOICE
When he's well.

BOY'S VOICE

6.CONT,

After a moment —
WOMAN'S VOICE
I don't know.
— and the sound of a door closing.
A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds
revealing the snow-patched street below. Leonard's friend,
crossing it, glances back . . . then disappears around a corner.
And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down,
extinguishing the single ray of light.

Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over

As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against
hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to
a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business
being here. He should leave.

Well, there we are, doctor.
Kaufman can't believe it, but is sent back a look that says,
We have no choice. The Director gets up out of his chair, and,
smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer. Which unsettles
Sayer. Which in turn unsettles the Director.

begging)
You do want the job, don't you?

There's a kind a "deadness" in Sullivan's eyes and voice; he's
been here too long.
SULLIVAN

asking too much. You're not the
neurologist.
SAYER

Sayer extends his hand. Instead of shaking it SULLIVAN

INT. DAYROOM (C) - DAY

Stepping around a wheelchair, Sayer finds in it an elderly
woman, nicely dressed, her hair done-up, a ribbon in it.
Glancing at the chart in his hand SAYER
Mrs. Cohen?
MRS. COHEN
He•s here?
She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she
means.
SAYER
I'm here.
(pause)
To examine you.
MRS. COHEN
Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My
son's coming to take me home.

Confused, Sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers
on the clipboard. Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her
and crosses the room to a nurse.
SAYER
Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son.
He's coming today?
NURSE 1
I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't
for twenty years.
The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen,
trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his
discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the
ribbon from her hair.

Silence. Institutional beige walls. Glass cabinets, locked,
containing medical instruments. A metal examination table with
leather straps.
Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room, still
unsettled from the experience with Mrs. Cohen. Eventually, he
gets up, crosses to a window and tries to open it.
It's jammed shut, painted shut perhaps, but finally gives way,
sliding up. He lets the air from outside wash over his face as
he stares out absently at children on an elementary school
playground beyond a debris-strewn field.
MISS COSTELLO O.S.
(a matter of fact)
It gets easier.
Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head
nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all.
She's standing in the doorway.

You don't think it will, but it

The needle of a Victrola clawing at the endless music-less
inner bands of a 78 . . .
. *

.

Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette
table. A puddle of coffee on the floor. Ceramic shards, a
broken cup. .
An old woman on her knees, eyes closed, arms tangled in an
aluminum walker, limp and stiff at once somehow, like the limbs
of a discarded marionette. Beyond her, beyond a threshold, a
shuttered living room. Furniture from another era and the
clutter of a lifetime.
A shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola.
Another old woman, with spindly limbs, profoundly afflicted and
preposterously still. The back of her head is flat and bald,
the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades.
On her passive face rest round wire-rim glasses. Insane or
retarded and unaware of the dead woman, she mumbles, just
barely audibly, a melody.
SAYER'S VOICE
Can you hear me?
16.

.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY

Distant music of children's laughter. Perhaps real, emanating
from outside; perhaps imagined, remembered, playing in a remote
region of the woman's damaged mind. Arrested of all movement,
she stares, transfixed, at the blades of a fan.
SAYER'S VOICE
Do you know where you are?
(nothing back)
Do you remember being brought
here?
(nothing back)
Do you know what has happened?
If she does, she gives no indication. No word or gesture. No
change of expression on her mask of a face. She is elsewhere
(or nowhere), cut adrift by her illness, living in a private
world (or hell).
SAYER'S VOICE
Can you hear me?
Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes.
Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes
are inscrutable.

Sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from
it. He cleans them with a flap of his lab coat — they are
loose, bent out of shape*— and gently slides the temples back
over her ears.
He turns away from her and types at a manual Underwood. The
form in the machine, at the top, reads — BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL /
ADMISSIONS / CONSULTATION REQUEST / NEUROLOGY. Sayer types in
a lower section headed — FINDINGS / DIAGNOSIS.

He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in
her wheelchair, one arm very close to the floor, the hand
clutching the glasses. She is not moving, but she has moved.
That, or she is dead.
Sayer rights her, takes the glasses from her hand and slips
them back onto her face. He studies her for a moment, and for
that moment remains as still, as entranced, as her.
He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the
floor. He waits. She doesn't retrieve them. He picks them up
and holds them out to her. She doesn't move to take them. He
lets go of them and she lunges forward, catching them the
instant before they hit the floor. Sayer just stares.

The same room as before. The same woman. All that has changed
is the light. It's late afternoon.
SAYER (CONT'D)
According to the neighbors,
she's never set foot outside her
apartment, has no other living
relatives, and has always been the
way she is now - without any
comprehension or response.

Kaufman tries to feign interest. He glances to the others
Sayer has summoned to the room — two other doctors, Tyler and
Sullivan, and Miss Costello.
SAYER
And yet . . .
Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at
her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it.
And stays there, stiff, still.
Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that
of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card
tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon —•
DR. KAUFMAN
A reflex.
SAYER
If she batted it away I might call
that a reflex. She doesn't bat it
away, she catches it.
-

DR. KAUFMAN
It's still a reflex.

SAYER
I'm sorry, if you were right I'd
agree with you.

Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment.
Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any.
SAYER
It's as if . . . having lost all
will of her own on which to act,
she borrows the will of the ball.
Awkward silence.

Eventually—

DR. TYLER
The "will of the ball?"

Sayer nods. Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances
that the theory and theorist are absurd.
DR. SULLIVAN
Excuse me.
Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room.
Tyler. Kaufman and Miss Costello remain.

So does

He does neither.

Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr.
Saver's patients waiting out there
are rescheduled for tomorrow?
MISS COSTELLO

looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one,

Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his

I just wanted to say to you I
preferred your explanation.

It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to.

MISS COSTELLO
And that I'll look after things
for you until you've "settled in."
Good night, doctor.
She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his
dashboard. To it eventually, quietly —
SAYER

He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away
toward her car. To the reflection -SAYER

Sidney turns to a patient, an elderly woman in a wheelchair
beside him. Her state resembles that of Lucy's, that is, she
appears to have no awareness of Sidney, Sayer, or anything else

soup into her mouth, careful not to spill any, that Sayer

Maintenance, please.

Waiting to be connected, he notices another "statue" (BERT).
What's unsettling about this one, apart from the man's ghostlike appearance, is the angle of his wheelchair. It's like an
askew painting, as if whoever was wheeling it simply let go of
the chair and this is where it and its cargo happened to come
*to rest, facing the wall.
Not wanting to lose the call, Sayer moves toward the patient,
keeping the receiver to his ear. At full extension of the
cord, unfortunately, he's still two paces short. Reaching back
with the arm with the phone, he gains distance and turns the
wheelchair quickly just as his call connects.
SAYER
Yes. Hi. I need a lock installed
on the door to the East Wing roof.
A big lock. The sooner the
better.

I'm sorry, this is Dr. Sayer. .

He glances around. Sees an orderly reading a newspaper.
Borrows a section, returns with it, slides it under the pen and
waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move.
Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket,
hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go.
The man, lightning quick, catches it.

Another man rigid as stone (FRANK). This one peering up at a
television set with a horizontal hold problem.
Sayer drags a chair over, stands on it, adjusts the set,
corrects it, gets a picture . . . but the man's "attention"
slowly drifts away. Sayer "readjusts" it, gets the jumping
horizontal lines again, and the man's vacant eyes return.

INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY

Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands
before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs.
It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement
of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness.
Sayer considers her from all angles as one considers an
abstract art piece that baffles but intrigues. Unlike the
others, she's on her feet. And unlike the others, she seems,
to Sayer, to have been headed somewhere before turning to stone
again.

He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain
across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that
has arrested her progress. He moves the table.
In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And
another. And another before encountering and being "blocked"
by an empty wheelchair. She stops.
Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her
path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the
fountain before mysteriously stopping again.
Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers
in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the
fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her.
Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost"
(LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive.
"At" Sayer.

Sayer considers one's original admission forms. He scans

He sets it aside and picks up another.

Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually
finds in its text — ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of
the file. "No change since last examination" it reads. He
turns the page. "No change, no therapy recommended." He turns
the page, the last entry. "No change." The date, "11/9/44."

Boxes of ancient history have been dragged out of storage, the
emphysema-plagued doctor's post-encephalitic research, files
and photographs and cans of 16mm film.
OLD DOCTOR
Most died during the acute stage
of the illness, during a sleep so
deep they couldn't be roused. A
sleep that in most cases lasted
several months.
The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage
projected onto a screen by a pre-World War II Bell & Howell a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping
open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from
invisible strings.
OLD DOCTOR
Those who survived, who awoke,
seemed fine, as though nothing had
happened. Years went by - five,
ten, fifteen - before anyone
suspected they were not well. .
They were not.
A doctor, this doctor decades younger, appears beside the
subject on the screen and lowers the man's arms.
OLD DOCTOR
I began to see them in the early
1930's - old people brought in by
their children, young people
brought in by their parents - all
of them complaining they weren't
"themselves" anymore. They'd
grown distant, aloof, anti-social,
they daydreamed at the dinner
table. I referred them to
psychiatrists.
The man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a sealshaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside.
They conspire against her, torment and harass her, force her to
perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands, to
paw her chin, to flutter, to adjust glasses that aren't there.

children on swings and slides. Jumping rope. Batting tether
balls. Playing hopscotch.
Moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games. On a girl
tossing a bean bag into a square. Jumping over it and into the
next square. Turning and jumping back. Balancing on one foot.
Retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down again. Into the
next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt.

INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY

51.

From above, patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white
checkerboard linoleum-tile floor like chess pieces. The
pattern is regular to a point but then breaks up — is
interrupted by an area of solid white, where a wall once stood
— before being restored. It forms a kind of narrow "sea," the
white area, on either side of which lies "land."
At floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and
knees, are "blacking in" the missing tiles with shoe polish,
"bridging" the gap between the two checkerboards. The retarded
patients around them ignore them. The ward nurses pretend to. '
Completing the pattern Sayer glances across the room to
Leonard. He seems to be "watching." His mother, nearby, idly
thumbing through a magazine as she brings Leonard up to date on
neighborhood news, isn't.

reaches the "bridge" and hesitates. Then crosses it.

Sayer doesn't know whether to applaud or cry. He does neither,
burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead, and
watches as Lucy, "delivered" to the other side, free now, lets
the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain.
She nears it. She is almost there. Then she is. there. But
doesn't drink. Doesn't stop. She continues past it . . .
To a window, the window bevond the drinking fountain which
Sayer hadn't noticed before, had no reason to notice, had no
need to notice, with a broken pane allowing a view to the
outside.
She stares out at the traffic below, in hopes no doubt of
figuring out where she is.
And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up,
shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose
mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer.
These people are alive inside.

INT. LEONARD'S WARD - LATER - NIGHT

In a far corner of the darkened ward, in a pool of lamp light,
two silhouetted figures. Sayer and Leonard. Sleeping patients
all around them.
Sayer carefully, awkwardly, places his hand on Leonard's.
After a moment, the contact brings the useless appendage "to
life." As it slowly turns over and grasps the doctor's hand, a
glimmer of life seems to appear in Leonard's eyes as well.
Sayer, unfamiliar, it seems, with the feeling the contact
produces in him, nonetheless places his other hand on Leonard's
other. Soon it too turns and holds onto Sayer's.
The doctor draws both of Leonard's hands toward him and sets
them down on the pointer of an Ouija Board.
SAYER
I'll begin moving the pointer
toward the "L." For "Leonard."
Once I feel you beginning to move
it, I'll stop and you'll take .

Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not. The
look on his face is "thoughtful." The look on Sayer's, hopeful
and foolish.
SAYER

The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons.
Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's
movement of it and, presumably, stops his own.

without stopping. It stops on the "R."

Sayer's smile fades. The possibility that Leonard might not
have realized the extent of the passage of time had not, until
this moment, occurred to him. He stares blankly at Miss

that it is not the 1930's.

Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests
and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he
pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there.
Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel
his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying
to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended.
He's not younjg anymore.

Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard,
resembles something out of Jules Verne. He allows Sayer to
buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as
Sayer performs the "complex" preparatory sequence necessary,
apparently, to make the car go.
The car pulls away. Above, framed in a second story window of
one of the buildings, stands a lone figure looking out —
Leonard's mother.

Billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers.
Buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale.

astonished by the tactile sensation.
Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real

purity or intensity Leonard can.
Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of
countless thousands of roses.

Children playing flag-football on an expanse of grass. Dogs
running around, nannies with prams, lovers.
A disk, a frisbee, falls at Leonard's feet. He retrieves it
but has no idea what it is or what to do with it. Sayer
demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one. Leonard
doesn't get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it
pathetically not halfway back to its owners.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine. He

Tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter.
Sayer, exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing
boxes on the floor for crackers, cookies, something he can
offer his guest.
He keeps glancing in at Leonard, who's wandering around the
dining room, navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the
spines of books. Noticing Sayer watching LEONARD
You just moved here.
SAYER
Yeah. Well, five years ago.

Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before
peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small
framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn
expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a
photography studio prop.

over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are
neatly arranged.

I wear outside. Two pairs, in
case I los.e one. Those, those are
my daytime reading glasses. And
spare. Those are for close work.
For fine print. Those are my
nighttime reading glasses Leonard's examining the frames of this last pair closely.
SAYER
That's heavy-gauge metal so when I
fall asleep and roll over on them
I don't wreck them. They're
indestructible.
Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place
and considers them all together.
SAYER
As long as I pretty much know
ahead of time what I'll be looking '
at, it works out, I don't have to
carry all five pairs around.
LEONARD
What if you just want to go for a
walk?
SAYER
(pause)
Walks are a problem. Walks are
the hardest thing. You just never
know.
He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an
imponderable dilemma. He retreats back into his kitchen before
reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and
some saltine% on a tray.

I can date my interest in science
precisely, actually. I'd been
sent off to boarding school - a
place perhaps not quite as
Dickensian as I remember it - when
I happened to come across the
periodic table of elements.
(smiles at the
thought)
I memorized it. Which I admit was
a rather precocious thing for a
seven year old to do. And I
remember feeling . . . not so much a
sense of accomplishment . . . as
comfort. The halogens were what
they were. The alkali metals were
what they were. Each element had
its place, and nothing could
change that. They were secure, no
matter what.
Leonard nods, perhaps more out of politeness than
understanding. Sayer nods too, feeling, perhaps, a little
exposed.

This was his condition when first
seen by me in a remote bay of this

I never asked why. Why was I sp
lucky, what did I do to deserve
this perfect child, this

MRS. LOWE
But when he got sick, you can bet
I asked why. I demanded to know
why. Why was this happening?
Silence. Then with an almost philosophical shrug:
MRS. LOWE

He holds out one of his shaking hands to her. She reaches to
it, places her hand on it, holds it, and the shaking slowly,
slowly, slowly begins to subside.
She lifts him gently out of his wheelchair and leads him away

sort of holding her and begins to slowly dance with him.

Some patients glance up from their food. Servers glance up
from their work. All watch with a sort of reverie the couple
dancing without music. They watch as Leonard's tics gradually
disappear. They watch as he finds a sense of grace and ease,
as he borrows her grace and ease. They watch him become,
simply, a man dancing with a woman.
From somewhere, perhaps imagined, there is music, a quiet
melody played on a piano.

(NOTE: Hay want to shoot front end of this scene again without
Rolando to leave open the option of using the same score Randy
writes for Lucy's walk to the window - SC. 51.)
Leonard, returning from the cafeteria, walks slowly into the
room. He's bent, his arms at strange angles like the limbs of
a diseased tree, his legs managing each step only with great
concentration.
He nears the center of the room, the area of inconsistent tiles
which Sayer and Miss Costello long ago conformed with shoe
polish. Some of the black has worn off, and as Leonard reaches
it, he finds himself thrown by the irregularity. He tries to
step over to "the other side,11 but his feet or legs or mind
will not do it.

Everyone in the room except Rolando becomes acutely aware of
the problem, of the struggle, of Leonard fighting with all his
will, and nothing but it, to "cross over."
He-crosses the "barrier." And, with surer but still difficult
steps, passes -the drinking fountain.
Tight on the window. Leonard rests his gnarled hand on the
frame as he peers down at Paula walking away from the hospital.
She glances back briefly before disappearing around a corner.

When did you realize it wasn't?
Leonard thinks back, trying to recall the exact moment he
realized he was "alive.n Finally —

One tear snakes down Saver's cheek. The film cuts to silent
footage of Leonard, soon after his awakening, combing his hair
and delighting in the fact that he cjan comb it.
Quietly, without looking at Miss Costello —
SAYER
You told him I was a kind man ...

It's kind to give life only to
take it away?
There is self-loathing in his voice. On the screen, Leonard's
trying to operate an electric shaver that seems alive.
MISS COSTELLO
It's given and taken away from
all of us.
On screen, Leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up
smiling, proud. Tight on sayer in the dark room, the projector
light flickering behind him. More to himself —
SAYER
Why doesn't that comfort me?

MISS COSTELLO
(quietly)
Because you are kind.

And because he's your friend.
On screen, Leonard is beckoning to someone unseen. No one
appears but he keeps beckoning. Finally Sayer, embarrassed and
camera shy, appears. Though there is no sound, it is clear he
asks, "What?" Leonard turns the doctor so that he is facing
the camera, and points. Sayer again asks, "What?" "There,"
Leonard says. "Where?" Sayer demands. Finally, Sayer
looks directly, curiously, into the camera.

It's for your son. It's for him.
Hector doesn't take it but doesn't say anything more about it
when Leonard sets it down on the coffee table.
HECTOR
At least let me give you a lift
wherever you're going.
LEONARD
No, I think I' d like to walk.
(to Hector's wife)
Thank you.

.

She nods, Your welcome, from the doorway of the kitchen.
Leonard offers his hand to Hector to shake.
HECTOR
What's wrong with you, Len?

LEONARD
(pause)
This is good, what you've got
here.
HECTOR
I know that.

Leonard smiles; the man does know it, and appreciates it.
LEONARD
Bye.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

223.

Descending from a fire escape strung with a single strand
of Christmas lights . . . down to the street below, to Leonard,
moving along the sidewalk, noticing:
A young couple, bundled up, hurrying down the stairs of a
basement apartment, fumbling with keys;
A Christmas tree too large for the doorway of an another
apartment across the street, being tugged at by someone inside,
unseen. >
Leonard smiles. His gait and tics, and especially the smile,
make him look insane. He passes a shop window with very simple
ornamentation as the proprietor inside switches out the lights,
and continues on, and into the darkness of the street ahead.

EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

-

224.

Black water. The river. The drone of engines and syncopated
rhythms of wheels of unseen cars.
Leonard, at the river's edge, stares into the water. His hand
comes out of his pocket holding the bag of L-Dopa capsules, and
he lets it fall in. It floats for a moment before a force from
below, like a hand, pulls it under.
224A.

EXT. EAST RIVER - DAWN

224A.

Leonard on a bench. Behind him, across an empty field, bums
huddled over a barrel fire warming their hands.
SAYER O.S.
Leonard?
Sayer's face appears against a pastel dawn sky. Leonard
glances up at him. Behind them, in the distance, Hector stands
outside his parked cab. Sayer sits. Long silence . . .

SAYER

224A.

I'm sorry.
LEONARD
What for?
He smiles crookedly, then looks out across the water again.
LEONARD
Isn't that something . . .
Sayer looks out. The morning colors are mirroring off the
water like paint on glass. They both watch. The colors are
deepening right before their eyes. Long, long silence
before . . .
LEONARD
Can you take me home?
Sayer helps him up. And as they move slowly toward the waiting
taxi. Hector opens the rear door. The only sound is the hiss
of tires, the -rhythm of wheels, .until LEONARD V.O.
When I was a boy I felt myself
being carried away by illness like
a swimmer sucked out by the tide.
Drifting slowly out across the water and the Brooklyn Bridge
stretching out across it.
LEONARD V.O.
I feel it again, only this time
J I've been somewhere.
I vent to a
place and felt things I never
dreamed of. I went to a place and
felt hope and fear and hatred and
love, I glimpsed life . . .

INT. LEONARD'S LIBRARY - BAINBRIDGE - DAY

Drifting slowly across the faces of patients reading in
Leonard's library, and settling finally tight on him, "asleep."
LEONARD V.O.
It's good, life.
Spines of books on shelves lining the walls. And Paula's face,
considering the titles.

It doesn't matter which one.
They're all his favorites.

She pulls one of the books down at random and crosses the
,
library with Sayer, passing patients - including the woman with
multiple sclerosis - readiny at tables with flowers on them.
SAYER O.S.
Leonard?
He's in a wheelchair, behind an oak desk on which rests, among
other things, the Ouija board. His eyes open but do not appear
to comprehend the doctor's presence or his surroundings. His
expression is absolutely "expressionless."
SAYER
I ' m sorry to wake you, but there's
someone here to see you.
Leonard remains still. "Asleep." And there's a long silence
broken only by the sound of pages being turned. And then, from
Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" —

' "^

PAULA
(reading)
"Night is generally my time for
walking. In the summer, I often
leave home early in the morning
and roam about fields and lanes.:
all day. Or even escape for
days or weeks together . . .
Leonard is unable to acknowledge in any way that he recognizes
the words or her voice . . . but he does. And as she reads,
the words become alive and the walls recede ...
PAULA
"But saving in the country, I
seldom go out until after dark,
though Heaven be thanked, I love
its light and feel the
cheerfulness it sheds upon the
earth as much as any creature
living . . . "
And he is moving into the light.
