FOR EDUCATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY

FADE IN:
EXT. DUBOCE STREET HILL SKYLINE (SAN FRANCISCO) - NIGHT
INT. BAR (SAN FRANCISCO) - NIGHT
UNDER CONTINUOUS ROARING ROCK MUSIC -- we see, but do not
hear:
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN
talking in groups or couples, some dancing, as lights
flash. Punk hairdos, heavy makeup. Chatter.
DAVID MALLOY, aged 25, well-dressed, leans close to a
uniformed police officer, holding a mike to the officer's
lips, as the officer talks. The wire from the mike leads
to a small recorder on the bar. Malloy also wears one
earphone plug connected to this recorder, which he holds
to his left ear.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER PART OF BAR - BOOTH
Malloy interviews two beautifully-dressed women, who
obviously flirt with him, as they answer his questions,
lean forward, talk into the mike. Malloy finishes his
drink, puts the recorder in his pocket, takes out a
cigarette, looks for a door.
EXT. ALLEYWAY - MALLOY
Cigarette on lip, stumbles in darkness, amid garbage cans
and debris, fumbling for lighter, then finally lighter
flashes.
LOUIS is REVEALED for one instant only an inch from
Malloy, his hand on Malloy's shoulder. Faces almost
touching. Malloy stumbles away in shock.
Louis recedes more slowly into shadow.
MALLOY
I'm sorry! I didn't know... you
were there.
He struggles to make out the figure but can't.
nervously.
I know.

Smokes

LOUIS

MALLOY
Really, I didn't mean to run into
you.
Go on.

LOUIS
Pass by.

Malloy stamps out the cigarette, holds up the hand mike.
MALLOY
You don't want to tell me the
story of your life, do you?
He flicks on the recorder in his pocket.

Eagerly.

MALLOY
That's what I do. I interview
people. I collect life stories.
Sometimes I interview four or five
people a night...
He backs away further.

Louis is perfectly still.

LOUIS
The story of my life?
MALLOY
Yes, I've been collecting lives
for years. F.M. radio. K.F.R.C.
In there I just interviewed a
genuine hero, a cop who...
LOUIS
(quietly, politely)
You'd have to have a lot of tape
for my story. I've had a very
unusual life.
MALLOY
So much the better. I've got
pockets full of tapes.
INT. ROOM (SAN FRANCISCO)
City skyline from Duboce Street hill.
Louis in shadow moves to the window, as behind him Malloy
sets the tape recorder on the table and sits in one of
two straight chairs. Dim light burns on chest of drawers
beyond. As they talk, Louis keeps his back to the room
and Malloy.

MALLOY
This is where you live?
LOUIS
It's just a room...
MALLOY
So how shall we begin?
(playfully, almost
teasing)
What do you do?
LOUIS
I'm a vampire.
MALLOY
Ah, and you mean this literally, I
take it.
LOUIS
Yes. I was waiting for you in
that alleyway. You or whoever
came out of that doorway. And
then you began to speak.
Malloy laughs goodnaturedly.
MALLOY
Well, what a lucky break for me.
LOUIS
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches
the table.
LOUIS
I want to tell you my story. All
of it. I'd like to do that very
much. I'm glad we've met.
Malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure,
fascinated but afraid.
MALLOY
You were going to kill me?
my blood?

Drink

LOUIS
Yes, but you needn't worry about
that now. I told you in the alley
to go on. I was letting you pass
by. I let a lot of motals pass
by.

Louis stands opposite, hand on the chair.
Malloy is riveted.
MALLOY
Oh this is one I have to hear.
You believe this, don't you? That
you're a vampire? You really
think...
LOUIS
(patiently)
We can't begin this way. I'm
going to turn on the light.
MALLOY
But I thought vampires didn't like
light.
LOUIS
We love it. I only wanted to
prepare you.
Louis pulls the cord of the overhead naked light bulb.
LOUIS'S FACE
appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. Inhuman or not
alive. The effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.
Good God!

MALLOY
He struggles to suppress fear and understand.
LOUIS
Don't be frightened.
opportunity.

I want this

The light appears to go out by itself and suddenly Louis
is in the chair, dimly lighted by the nearby lamp and the
tape recorder has been turned on. The cassette is
turning.
MALLOY
How did you do that!
LOUIS
The same way you do it. A series
of simple gestures. Only I moved
too fast for you to see. I'm
flesh and blood. Only not human.
(MORE)

LOUIS (CONT'D)
I haven't been for two hundred
years.
Malloy is speechless, frightened, yet enthralled.
Spellbound.
LOUIS
What can I do to put you at ease?
Shall we begin like David
Copperfield? I am born, I grow
up. Or shall we begin when I was
born to darkness, as we call it.
That's really where we should
start, don't you think?
MALLOY
(baffled)
You're not lying to me, are you?
LOUIS
No. 1791 -- that's the year when
it happened. I was twenty-four -younger than you are now.
Yes.

MALLOY
LOUIS
But times were different then. I
was a man at that age. The master
of a large plantation just South
of New Orleans...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LOUISIANA - DAY (1791)
A disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket frock
coat, rides his horse through the fields of indigo,
waving here and there to the African slaves at work.
He passes slave quarters and the distant colonial raised
cottage mansion of Pointe du Lac.
CONTINUE V.O. as he speaks he approaches a small parish
church and graveyard. He dismounts, approaches a rectangular Greek style above ground tomb. The stone is
like a doorway.

LOUIS (V.O.)
I had only just lost my wife in
childbirth. She and the infant
had been buried less than half a
year.
Inscriptions on the high rectangular tomb show the names:
DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791
INFANT JEAN MARIE 1791
Louis in mix of anger and sadness pushes away the vines
already covering the head stone and stares bitterly at
the inscription which he touches with his fingers. Takes
a flask from his pocket, takes a heavy drink. He sits,
exhausted, against the grave, as if close to his wife and
child. Face tender and sad.
INT. DINING ROOM (POINTE DU LAC) - NIGHT
Table set with candelabra, gorgeous China.
Louis in soiled shirt and boots, sits at the head of the
table, staring at a plate full of steaming food.
YVETTE, pretty Mulatto slave, pours his glass full of
wine.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I had everything a man could ask
for. Yet a darkness had come that
would not lift.
YVETTE
Please, Michie, eat your supper.
Please. We pray for you every
day.
Louis doesn't move.
Yvette takes his linen napkin from the ring and tries to
put it in his lap. He takes her wrist firmly. Rises
from table.
LOUIS
(patiently)
I know, ma chere. I need time.
EXT. RIVERFRONT STREET (NEW ORLEANS)
of gunwale sidewalks and loud, crowded riverfront taverns
full of ruffians.

Louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade coat walks
drunkenly along the sidewalk. As he enters a crowded,
smoky little tavern and blunders into a card game, flatboat men and one FANCY-DRESSED GAMBLER eye him as a mark.
He lays his money down on the table. They deal him in.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Perhaps if I'd had time, I would
have come to my senses. Who can
say? I might have married again.
As it was, I courted death, taking
every risk that I could.
As the men play cards two tavern waitresses approach -TERESA and SUZANNE. Suzanne throws her arms around
Louis, and exchanging glances with the Fancy-Dressed
Gambler, puts a powder into a drink of whiskey which she
pushes toward Louis, eyeing him stealthily. Teresa
watches all and looks down at Louis' hand of cards.
PAN OVER tavern scene -- Indians, men of color, black
African freedmen, sailors and wenches.
LESTAT, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from
beneath the shadow of his hood. Gleaming blue eyes.
CLOSE ON - LESTAT
He approaches the table as:
Louis lifts the glass of drugged whiskey. The hooded and
cloaked figure of Lestat knocks it out of his hand,
bumping into Suzanne and knocking Teresa roughly to one
side.
Louis rises, drunk, outraged.
LOUIS
How dare you, monsieur.
Louis pulls out a pearl-handled pistol. Teresa clings
to him. Others gasp and give way, though eager to see
what will happen.
Lestat, face half-covered by the hood but eyes gleaming,
backs away through the crowd, eyes riveted on Louis,
smiling. The crowd closes indifferently.
Louis is slightly dazed by Lestat's eyes. Then shudders,
loses interest, sits down and picks up his cards.

EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET - COTTAGE - NIGHT
Louis and QUADROON PROSTITUTE emerge from the cottage,
kissing fervently.
QUADROON PROSTITUTE
Don't leave me, Michie Louis.
Fancy-Dressed Gambler appears from shadows.
FANCY-DRESSED GAMBLER
First you call me a cheat, then
you try to steal my woman.
The Gambler spins Louis around and goes to hit him.
Louis blocks punch, knocks Gambler into the dirt.
Quadroon Prostitute shouts warning to Louis as the
Gambler draws his pistol.
LOUIS
Go ahead. Do it. I'm already
dead. Finish the task, so they
can sing the Requiem.
Louis shrugs.
Gambler rises slowly and warily holding the gun on Louis.
GAMBLER
The Oaks; tomorrow morning at
six.
Louis laughs and shakes his head, no.

He turns his back.

CLOSE ON - LOUIS'S FACE
thoughtful distant, and behind him -Coward!

GAMBLER
Louis staggers down the wood sidewalk. Quadroon
Prostitute comes after him, embracing him, and he kisses
her firmly and gently pushes her away. She pleads with
him in French.
LOUIS (V.O.)
My invitation was open to anyone.
But it was a vampire that
accepted. I had never conceived
of such a thing.
Louis moves on into darkness among small colonial French
buildings.

Rain falls. He looks up in it and lets it drench him.
Over his shoulder, we see Lestat approach, hood still
shadowing his face.
ANGLE ON LESTAT'S BLUE EYES
Lestat's hands clamp on Louis's shoulder and then Louis
stiffens, cries out and freezes, as Lestat's teeth go
into his neck.
Louis slips from Lestat's grasp, unconscious in the mud
and rain.
INT. ROOM (SAN FRANCISCO)
Malloy and Louis facing each other.
MALLOY
That's how it happened?
LOUIS
No. That is how vampires drink
blood. The Dark Gift of
transformation requires a good
deal more as you'll see.
Besides, this vampire wanted
something from me. He came back
for it the following night.
INT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC
(NEW ORLEANS)
Louis is delirious in four-poster bed, shrouded with
mosquito netting. Female slave Yvette bathes his face
with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover in
shadows. Overseer, a Quadroon male, stands weeping in
door.
Yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed.
LOUIS
My poor Yvette. What will become
of you -- all of you -- if I die?
YVETTE
You won't die, Michie. We need
you. You won't leave us here.

SAME SCENE - LATER
Louis alone.
Candlelight flickers on face of bisque virgin.
Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently.
Then he opens his eyes.
Lestat, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands
beside the bed smiling. In the light of the candle, we
see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too
bright. It is more subtle than earlier electric light
shot of Louis. Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous,
but impossible -- an angel or a monster.
Louis rises, grabs for his pistol from the table and
cocks it.
LOUIS
Who the hell are you? What are
you doing in my house?
LESTAT
(looking around the
lavish bedroom)
And such a beautiful house.
is a beautiful life.

Yours

Louis takes aim and FIRES.
The BULLET passes through Lestat's slightly raised hand.
It leaves a bloody wound. Lestat winces, studies the
wound. It begins to heal as we watch.
Louis reaches for his sword, hanging over the end of the
bed. He struggles to get up.
LESTAT
You're not afraid of anything, are
you?
LOUIS
Why the hell should I be?
you again. Get out!

I warn

LESTAT
Are you going to put that sword
through me, too? Ruin my beautiful
clothes?
Louis rises up, jabs the rapier at Lestat who effortlessly knocks it from his hand. It "appears" across the
room on the floor.

Louis slumps against the headboard, staring keenly at
Lestat. He is in a rage.
LOUIS
(quietly and coldly)
If some voodoo priest sent you
here, say so. If you're the
devil, I'm all yours.
LESTAT
I don't believe in voodoo priests
or the devil. Neither do you.
Lestat sits on the side of the bed, facing Louis.
LESTAT
But I do believe in eternal life.
Lestat holds up his bullet-wounded palm, and we see the
very last healing as it smooths out and is whole again.
LOUIS
(coldly)
How was this done?
LESTAT
I love your courage. I even love
your grief. You're no simple
soul, are you, my friend?
Louis is bewildered.

Feels pain.

Is becoming spellbound.

Sound of SEA RISING.
LESTAT
What if I told you I could give
you back your old passion for
living, and that for those with
courage, living can be for all
time?
Sound of HEARTBEAT, DRUM IN TIME WITH IT...
DISSOLVE TO:
DARK SEA
An 18th century ship sailing with black ragged sails.
Only two figures on the top deck, Lestat at the wheel and
Louis, in his soiled night shirt watching him. In this
sea are the ruins of buildings, temples, churches, seen
dimly in the midst.

LESTAT (V.O.)
Vampires, that's what we are.
Creatures of darkness, only we see
more clearly in that darkness than
any mortal has ever seen!
Dead men and women float in the water. Louis is amazed.
Dead woman and dead infant float by. A giant dead oak
floats by. Lestat holds the wheel steady. Lestat points
to the horizon of white clouds stacked high under the
moon. The two speak together but we do not hear their
words.
EXT. PARISH GRAVEYARD (LOUISIANA) - NIGHT
Louis and Lestat stand before the tall crypt of Louis's
wife and baby. Sounds of WIND. Lestat leads Louis from
the graveyard into a dreamlike swampland.
DREAM SEQUENCE
thickens as we see HAZY fragments suggesting possibility:
A)

Louis, beautifully-dressed, dancing with a woman.

B)

Louis and Lestat together riding horses fast through
the night.

LAUGHTER, MUSIC, HEARTBEAT INTERMINGLE.
PAN OVER an audience of bejeweled and wigged spectators
all clapping and cheering. Return to:
INT. LOUIS'S BEDROOM
Louis sits against the bedstead staring intently at
Lestat.
Silence.
FOCUS ON LESTAT
seated on the bed.
Then:
LESTAT
You have to ask me for this. You
have to give your full consent,
do you hear?

LOUIS
Give it to me!
LESTAT
(seductive)
Vampires. We slay our brothers
and sisters.
I want it!

LOUIS
LESTAT
And thrive on their blood.
LOUIS
Give it to me.
Lestat bends close as if to drink Louis's blood. Louis
does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat
draws back, stands up, leaves through French doors, then
says:
LESTAT
Tomorrow night. I want you to
prove yourself. I shall give you
the choice I never had.
(looks outside)
The sun's coming. Watch it
carefully. If you join me
tomorrow, you'll never see the sun
again.
Louis sits dazed staring at the empty French windows.
The sun rises over the swamplands and the plantation. Sun
fills the room, striking water pitcher, glass, mirror.
INT. RIVERFRONT TAVERN (NEW ORLEANS)
Crowds of gamblers and revelers carry on at tables and
makeshift bar.
Suzanne is slipping a poison into a man's drink and then
helps him stagger into:
EXT. ALLEYWAY
There she robs the man and lets him fall down dead in the
mud.

INT. TAVERN - LOUIS AND LESTAT
at a corner table are watching Suzanne as she re-enters.
LOUIS
(fearfully,
confusedly)
You mean now, with this knife?
He reveals the dagger inside his coat.
LESTAT
She's an evildoer, my friend.
I've made it easy for you. Don't
you see what she's up to? If you
can kill her, the Dark Gift is
yours.
Louis rises, uncertain, crazed, pushes through the
crowded tavern, approaches Suzanne and seduces her out
into the same alley.
EXT. ALLEYWAY
Louis stares in horror at the bloody knife in his hand as
Suzanne falls back dead onto the ground.
Lestat appears over his shoulder, looking coldly at the
dead woman. He puts his hand on Louis's shoulder.
LOUIS
What have I done?
LESTAT
(reassuring)
It won't be this way when you're
one of us.
Louis drops the dagger on the ground and moves away fast.
EXT. POINTE DU LAC
Louis on a horse dismounts and walks towards the steps
leading up to the gallery. He is crazed with guilt.
Suddenly, as he comes into light from lantern at foot of
steps he sees -LESTAT
sitting collected at the head of the steps.

LOUIS
backs up as Lestat rises and descends the steps so fluidly
he hardly appears to move. Light from lantern illuminates
Louis as:
LOUIS
You are the devil, aren't you?
That's who you are.
LESTAT
(gently)
I wish I were. But if I were,
what would I want with you?
LOUIS
I can't go through with this.
LESTAT
You're perfect for it. You're
bitter, and you're strong.
LOUIS
But why do you want me?
LESTAT
Because you're as strong as I
was... when I was alive. And
besides, I like you. I like your
conscience. You remind me of...
myself.
Louis takes out his flask and drinks. Fearlessly, drunkenly, he turns and heads slowly for the nearby swamp.
EXT. PARISH CEMETERY - GRAVES OF LOUIS'S WIFE AND BABY
Louis stops in front of the crypt.
against the stone.

Leans his forehead

Lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.
LESTAT
You really want to be with them?
LOUIS
Yes. I killed that tavern girl.
I deserve to die.
Lestat in quiet rage, raises his right fist and shatters
into large fragments the rectangular marble face stone,
revealing two coffins on the upper and lower shelf.
Insects swarm from opening.

The upper coffin slides out, cracks open, revealing halfrotted body of a woman, holding an infant, no longer
recognizable as individuals, a tangle of gruesome, rotted
flesh, hair, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling
over it.
Louis gasps and bends closer taking in the full horror.
LESTAT
It's not your wife and child,
Louis. It's death. Just that
simple. Think and choose. It
happens to everyone. Except us.
Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy dreamlike
vision, and then hyperclear. He draws closer and closer.
We hear the FLASK fall and BREAK ON paving STONES.
Louis is again spellbound.

Sound of HEARTBEAT.

Lestate appears angelic in his radiance.
LESTAT (V.O.)
(patient and
persuasive)
We shall be this way, always.
Young as we are now. I'm so
lonely for a companion... But you
must ask. Do you want to or no?
Louis's senses are confused.

Yes.

He is entranced.

LOUIS
(tentative and then
sure)
Yes!

Lestat embraces Louis obscuring his face. HEARTBEAT grows
LOUDER. DRUMBEAT comes, OUT OF SYNC, but almost together.
LOUIS'S POV
The moon, the clouds, the sky, and fragments of earlier
visions, blurred figures are glimpsed, with earlier dream
images. LAUGHTER and MUSIC rise and fall under the
UNSYNCHRONIZED SLOWING BEAT of the HEART and the DRUM.
BACK TO SCENE
Lestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt.

Lestat stands over him, once again radiant.
gently.

Lestat speaks

LESTAT
You may go now.
Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a kiss.
No!

LOUIS
No, give it to me.

Lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs
slash his own flesh, blood falls. Louis rises to receive
the first drops into his open mouth. Lestat gathers him
up, as Louis clamps his hand on Lestat's arm and sucks
from the wrist.
HEARTBEAT AND DRUMBEAT are SYNCHRONIZED and grow STRONGER
and pick up speed.
Louis is released.

Staggers.

VAMPIRE VISION
The world around him (and the look of the film) is transformed; the swamp, the CRY of the night BIRDS, the moon,
the clouds, all reflect his heightened vision. He looks
down in pity on the rotted woman and infant who appear to
glitter and to be beautiful rather than repulsive. He
closes the lid of the coffin, astonished at the ease of
it. Then lifts the entire coffin and returns it to its
slot in the crypt.
He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with a
vampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter. His
buttons are glimmering in the light.
Everything is clearer, brighter, containing more facets
of light and color.
LESTAT
(lighthearted)
Stop staring at my buttons.
Didn't I tell you it was going to
be fun? But we've work to do.
Lestat leads him into the swamp. Tiny CREATURES move or
SING everywhere; leaves move as if growing before Louis's
eyes. The water makes myriad OVERLAPPING sounds, and he
can see deep into it, to the creatures swimming in the
depths.

Louis stops, hand going around his waist as he feels a
cramp of pain.
LESTAT
Your body's dying, pay no
attention. It will take twenty
minutes at most.
Louis is horrified, but the beauty of moon flowers and
banana trees continues to distract him. The sky is
violet, flooded with luminosity. Again he feels pain.
LESTAT
Come, you're going to feed now.
LOUIS
I want a woman.
Lestat laughs and the laughter echoes like bells in
Louis's ears.
LESTAT
That doesn't matter anymore,
Louis. You'll see. Come...
LOUIS'S DAZZLED POV - SWAMP
Small high ground. Camp of runaway slaves. Several share
a bottle of rum around the fire. Male slave rises, a
gorgeous hunk of flesh in the firelight, simply beautiful
(Razor Rudduck) and goes into swamp to relieve his
bladder.
LESTAT (O.S.)
They're all beautiful now. Men,
women, the old, the young... simply
because they are alive.
BACK TO SCENE
Louis sees.
The slave comes nearer.
Louis pushes past Lestat. Lestat is surprised but amused
and proud, and folds his arms to watch. Louis sees the
tiny crucifix on a chain around the slave's neck. Stops.
Lestat snatches the crucifix off the man and throws it
away, urging Louis towards him.

SLAVE'S POV
Two gleaming white beings stand before him with devil's
eyes.
BACK TO SCENE
As the slave tries to bolt, Louis embraces him easily
then his teeth into the powerful neck. They are new
fangs, he has to really bite into the victim, but he is
ravenous to do it. Holds tight to the man as he drinks.
LOUIS'S POV
Trance as he drinks the blood. ECHO of Lestat's LAUGHTER
as the swoon thickens. Distant firelight gets brighter
and brighter.
INT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT
Main floor parlor and dining room with floorlength windows
to porches on all sides. Building for all its high ceilings is crude. Furnishing is lavish Parisian Louis XVI.
Lestat plays the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly...
an improvisation on Bach as Louis -- skin whiter, eyes
brighter -- wanders from room to room, dazzled by the
candles, the light on the furniture, the petit point
tapestry of the chairs, the draperies. Before a mirror
he stops amazed to see his reflection. In the distance,
over the MUSIC, Lestat laughs.
LESTAT
Yes, that's you, my handsome
friend. And you'll look that way
until the stars fall from heaven!
Louis draws closer to the mirror, and sees his small, now
fully-developed fangs. He runs his tongue over them.
LESTAT
Those will make it easier next
time to neatly puncture the flesh.
We are well mannered immortals,
always remember.
WILD MUSIC.
YVETTE
the mulatto slave, stands still in alarm on the porch
gazing at Louis as he stares into the mirror.

Slowly Louis turns to her and is stupefied by her natural
beauty.
The MUSIC gets LOUDER and more FRENZIED.
Louis moves out past the dazzled Yvette, along the -EXT. GALLERY AND STAIRS TO GROUND
He moves out onto the grass and looks up at the stars.
He begins to turn around. And suddenly he raises his
hands to his lips and he roars. It's a long, horrified,
grief-stricken roar. It DROWNS OUT the MUSIC.
INT. BASEMENT OF POINTE DU LAC
A brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the
floor. Lestat, holding a lantern, closes and bolts the
door. Then turns to see -LOUIS
a full-fledged vampire of high gloss -- sitting on a bench
staring at the coffin. Louis is stunned.
Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He
approaches the nearest of the coffins and opens it. It is
fitted with satin inside. Louis stares at it in shock.
Then looks away sharply, staring at the lantern.
LESTAT
You must get into it.
burn you to ashes.

The sun can

LOUIS
But is it magical or merely a
shelter?
LESTAT
It's the best shelter that you can
have.
Louis rises, approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he
peers into it.
LESTAT
Don't be afraid. In moments you'll
sleep as soundly as ever you slept
when you were living. You'll dream.
And when you wake I'll be waiting
for you, and so will all the world.

Louis looks for assurance at Lestat's beaming face. We
can see the fear behind Lestat's smile. The uncertainty.
LOUIS
You told me something. Earlier.
You said that you didn't have a
choice. Was that true?
Lestat smiles bitterly and nods.
He points to the coffin.
CLOSE ON HIS HAND
pointing into the coffin.
LESTAT (O.S.)
Some night I'll tell you that
story, if you like. We have a lot
of time now to talk to each other.
Louis gracefully crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated, and is suddenly lying on his back as the lid
comes down with a bang. Total darkness. Sounds of his
breathing, of his gasp. Of a whispered prayer:
Dear God.

LOUIS (O.S.)

EXT. NEW ORLEANS
A big lavish drinking place with a raised stage.
Italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude commedia
dell'arte on the stage.
Plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs,
some pretentious, some drunk, some merely young and happy,
watch the show as tavern wenches move about.
CLOSE ON TERESA
entering.

Looking about.

TERESA'S POV
Louis and Lestat at a small table watch the comedy.
Lestat laughs uproariously at the antics of the actors,
who trip or hit each other Punch and Judy style. Louis
is quietly amused and amazed as much by the wine in his
untouched glass, or the light on his boot. But he too
watches the stage.

BACK TO SCENE
Teresa comes, offers the men two more drinks, even though
their wine is untouched. Sits in Lestat's lap.
Lestat winks at Louis who is enthralled.
Teresa lifts the fresh glass to Lestat's lips as he flirts
with her.
TERESA
Come on, mon cher. The best in
the colony. Once you taste this,
you never go to any other tavern
again.
LESTAT
You think so, cherie? But what if
that's not what I want to drink.
Lestat sinks his teeth into her neck as he looks playfully
beyond her at Louis who is amazed and amused in spite of
himself.
ANTICS ON STAGE
Laughter rocks the tavern.
Lestat slips the dying, dazed Teresa onto Louis's lap.
Louis studies her but does not drink. Gently he puts her
in the chair beside him, and folds her hands on the table.
She appears drunk. He wants to laugh but is ashamed. No
one notices. Lestat lays gold coins on the table, and
touches Louis's knee.
LESTAT
Let's get out of here!
Delighting in their own mischievousness, they rush out.
EXT. STREET
Louis is suddenly distracted by the moon moving beyond
the clouds. Distant MUSIC from a ball room. The breeze.
LESTAT
Come, let me show you a lovely game.
EXT. BALLROOM
Quadroon house of ill fame. Beautiful dark-skinned
quadroons, octaroons, mulattresses are dancing with white
men as a mulatto or quadroon orchestra plays.

Men and women dance minuet. But even more men and women
merely cluster everywhere, talking and laughing and
flirting. Drinking wine.
Lestat spies a pretty dark girl, neglected.
LOUIS
(in a whisper)
Have you ever been caught?
LESTAT
Of course not. It's so simple.
You almost feel sorry for them.
Now watch me. This is called the
Little Drink. You take it
whenever you wish.
Music rises and becomes faster as Lestat embraces dark
girl, startling her with sudden kiss on the neck, his
eyes closing for one minute, and then leaving her dazed
before she even knows she's been bitten.
Lestat embraces a red-haired yellow-skinned girl, turning
her in a wild embrace, and giving her the same "little
bite." Then goes to an elderly quadroon, a chaperone, and
flirting with her, takes "the little drink" from her.
Lestat backs up next to Louis. Lestat is dazed.
is a faint sheen of blood on his lips.

LESTAT
Oh, it takes skill, and restraint!
But it's worth it. It's fun.
Louis is suddenly drawn to a victim.

staring at him all this while. Very pale, very calculating, and very luscious.
Louis is dazed with hunger.

Moves towards her, embraces

lighted by candles.
Louis kisses her lips and then sinks his teeth in her
throat. The swoon takes him into the realm of light and
music only.
Suddenly Lestat pulls him away.

Toinette lies against a chair, dead.
LESTAT
You need a little practice.
Louis stares at the body.
LESTAT
But never mind. She was a
merciless little schemer. The
town is thick with them.
Lestat leads Louis out into the night.
LOUIS
But how do you know?
was... innocence.

All I tasted

LESTAT
From her thoughts. Couldn't you
read her thoughts?
Louis shakes his head.
LESTAT
You can't hear anything they're
thinking?
LOUIS
No. I hear no thoughts from
anyone.
Lestat considers, then shrugs. He throws his arm over
Louis's shoulder and they walk together.
LESTAT
The Dark Gift is different for
each of us. But one thing is
true of everyone. We become more
powerful as we go along. You'll
learn to pick the evil ones.
LOUIS
Yes, I see things in the faces of
men and women...
LESTAT
Oh, I'm not the right hand of God,
mind you. Nor the local constable
or judge. It's just that
evildoers are easier. And they
taste better.

EXT. GIANT OAK TREE BESIDE COLONIAL MANSION
Lestat leads Louis with preternatural ease up high into
the tree, then onto the gallery of the mansion. They
peer through glass doors into huge library.
LOUIS
You hoped I'd be better all this,
didn't you?
Lestat interested in the library inside.
LESTAT
I didn't know, to tell the truth.
And you're doing very well.
Lestat easily pries open the door and enters. A man dozes
by the fire in a chair. Lestat moves all around him
soundlessly, and smiles as he takes books: Tristram
Shady, Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders. He tosses a
volume of Byron to Louis, who catches it easily, wary of
the sleeping man, who never stirs. They leave, the man
still dozes.
INT. POINTE DU LAC - LOUIS'S PARLOR
Lestat sits paging through his new books.
LESTAT
Wonderful new novels from England.
Remember, you can move easily
around them without making a sound
that they can hear. Look, he
never even read any of these
books, he never cut the pages.
Louis follows Lestat out onto the gallery of Pointe Du
Lac. They look out over the river.
LOUIS
But what are the rules? What is
it we can not do? What are we,
really?
Lestat looks at the river:
LESTAT
What in the world makes you think
there are any rules for anyone,
Louis? We're vampires, I've told
you. You must find your own way
on the Devil's Road, as I did.

EXT. STREET
Louis and Lestat argue as they hurry past riverfront
taverns and lighted colonial houses.
LOUIS
But surely you must know something
about the meaning of it all, you
must know where we come from, why
we...
Lestat in rage comes to a halt.
LESTAT
Why? Why should I know these
things? Look.
He points into the tavern.
LESTAT
Does anybody in there know the
answers? Go to the priest. Ask
him!
LOUIS
But the vampire who made you.
What happened. What did he tell
you? There must be some purpose.
LESTAT
(laughs in spite
of himself)
Purpose? Louis, what purpose was
there to your life last week, or
last month, or last year?
Lestat rushes along, impatient, hating this discussion.
LOUIS
I cursed God that he took my wife
and my child from me. But I
never doubted...
Loses conviction.

Louis questions himself silently.

LESTAT
Shall I make up stories for you?
LOUIS
No. But you must have learnt
something from the one who made
you.
LESTAT
I learnt less than you've learnt
from me. I wasn't given a
choice, remember?

He comes to a halt before a little theatre. Sounds of
LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, CLAPPING from inside. Posters
announce a Shakespearean play by English actors.
Lestat caught by the SOUND moves inside.
INT. SMALL WOODEN BUILDING
Smoky footlamps reveal crude Macbeth and Lady Macbeth
arguing with each other. Crowd talks, eats, drinks,
yells for more action. Actors ignore them.
CLOSE ON LESTAT
With Louis beside him.
LOUIS
How did it happen? Where?
EXT. WOODEN BUILDING
Lestat angrily shoves Louis back out into the night.
Louis is vulnerable.
LESTAT
Listen, my beloved fledgling.
I'll say this once and once only.
I've no secrets to tell you. I've
never laid eyes on God or the
Devil. And pity the Devil if I
ever do. You have received from
me all I have to give!
Louis is wounded, but quiet.
patiently.

Lestat goes on more

LESTAT
The one who made me was mad.
That's what often happens to the
old ones. He'd lasted a few more
hundred years than most of them.
And he wanted an heir before he
burnt himself on his own pyre. He
left me there to witness it.
Newborn. There was no one there
to guide me as I've guided you.
Louis tries to accept this, bowing to Lestat's anger.
Lestat walks on and Louis follows.
Lestat talks as we see:

ENGLISH STAGE
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth engaged in conversation.
LESTAT (V.O.)
You want to know how it happened?
I was an actor. Oh, nothing so
very great. Just the boulevards
in Paris, but if you'd come from
the provinces as I had, they
seemed splendid enough.
INT. BOULEVARD THEATRE (PARIS)
Lestat as a human (far less lustrous) plays Lelio in the
Commedia. He bows and introduces himself to the audience.
We can not make out his words, only that he is making them
laugh. He pretends to be choking on the smoke from the
footlamps. Then goes back into character. More laughter.
LESTAT (V.O.)
You might say he picked me for my
yellow hair. Or perhaps because
in my country youth, I'd been a
good hunter. And we must be good
hunters, we vampires. We must like
the hunt, or we can't survive.
CLOSE ON LESTAT
Transfixed on the stage.
HIS POV - MAGNUS
An old male vampire heavily cloaked, with a face almost
like a skull, peering from the audience at Lestat.
LOUIS (V.O.)
So it's passed on, one to another,
century after century. And he
left you no secrets except that
fire can destroy you. And so can
the sun.
LESTAT (V.O.)
Jewels, that's what he gave me,
and a coffin such as you'll never
see in this damned wilderness.
And a tower, yes, and clothes.
He left me such fine clothes. We
are the secret, Louis. Maybe this
is all a secret. Maybe God
himself has forgotten we're all
here.

INT. POINT DU LAC - DINING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
Louis XVI chairs, table, sideboard.
gleam on sideboard.

Crystal glasses

Louis sits at the table watching Lestat as Lestat paces.
LOUIS
What if we are wounded, a stake
driven through the heart, a bullet...
Lestat is vaguely amused.
LESTAT
We heal. You saw this for yourself
the night you aimed your pistol at
me. It may take time but we heal.
Only the destruction of our bodies
brings us to the finish. Crosses,
garlic, all that rubbish has no
power over us, naturally. We can
not turn to mist and pass through
keyholes. We are not magical
creatures, really, merely lucky
little devils, so to speak.
LOUIS
Preternatural.
LESTAT
(kindly)
Good word. Come with me. It's
been weeks since we've hunted
together. Let's go...
LOUIS
How long can I go without feeding?
One night? Two?
LESTAT
(impatient but kind)
You'll have to find that out for
yourself. Never let yourself
become so weak that you can't
feed. That's an endless living
death in itself.
Louis ponders.
LESTAT
Are you trying to tell me you
don't like it? Are you trying to
say that every time the blood
touches your tongue you don't
feel that pleasure.

LOUIS
You know I do. But I didn't see
things clearly before. I didn't
see them for what they are.
LESTAT
And now you know what life is and
you have eternity to enjoy it.
LOUIS
I have eternity to destroy it.
LESTAT
Louis, there's nothing beyond your
reach now. Stop grieving for
yourself. And for your victims!
Louis does not respond.
LESTAT
Look, you need a little
refreshment. Here, let me show
you another little trick. Your
trouble is you don't experiment
enough on your own.
He picks up one of the crystal glasses, holds it to the
light of the candelabra and then sets it before Louis.
He turns, one eyebrow raised, listening, and then he
darts too fast for us to see through the French door,
curtains closing behind him.
Louis gasps as Lestat appears before the table, holding a
long-tailed gray rat. The rat appears paralyzed, as
Lestat tears open its throat with his own teeth, and lets
the rat's blood gush into the crystal glass. Lestat
begins a low, helpless laugh. Absently he lays the rat
to the side on the lace tablecloth.
Louis is impressed in spite of himself. Smiles, shakes
his head. Lestat hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks
the blood, and stares at it in surprise.
I know.

LESTAT
It gets cold so fast.

LOUIS
We can live from this, the blood
of animals?
Lestat shrugs.

LESTAT
I wouldn't call it living. I'd
call it surviving. And you may
have to do, now and then. You'd
better know the trick if ever you
find yourself for a month on a
ship at sea, unless you mean to
slay all the passengers and the
crew.
Louis downs all the blood in the glass. His eyes are
suddenly bloodshot. He wipes his mouth.
He stares at the body of the rat.
Rat is soft and beautiful to behold.
hands and feet; lovely eyes.

Very delicate little

LESTAT
It doesn't disgust you, does it?
Lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it,
smiling.
LESTAT
There's nothing in the world now
that doesn't hold some...
LOUIS
... fascination.
LESTAT
Yes. And I'm restless. I don't
want to spend another evening
here. There's an opera in New
Orleans tonight. A real true
French opera.
LOUIS
But we can live on animals. We
can live without taking human
life.
LESTAT
Yes, I suppose we can. But how
long do you think you can resist
mortals? Give it a try.
LOUIS
I can't take blood from mortals
without killing. You know that.

LESTAT
(imploring)
But don't you see, it's the death
you want, as surely as the blood.
It's the life that flows with it
when you drink.
LOUIS
My God. I know. I do see.
know. I know.

LESTAT
(patient but
frightened)
I won't stay here engaging in this
sophomoric prattle. You have all
of them out waiting for you. Take
the evildoers if you must. Mon
dieu, are there not hundreds in
this miserable little place? And
what a paradise they make for us,
Louis, with their dancing and
drinking till dawn?
LOUIS
Wasn't it that way in Paris?
did you come here?

Why

Lestat laughs beguilingly as he rises.
LESTAT
In Paris, a vampire has to be
clever for many reasons. Here,
all one needs is a pair of fangs.
He becomes frustrated at Louis, snatches his cloak and tricorne hat from the chair and turns to go. Louis says
nothing.
Lestat, stubborn and conflicted, leaves.
Sound of LESTAT'S SINGING an Aria in Italian as he leaves.
Then sound of the HORSE RIDING AWAY.
Yvette, the slave woman enters.
Michi Louis?
supper?

YVETTE
You don't want any

Louis stares at the glass with its thin residue of blood.
He laughs soundlessly.

LOUIS
No, ma cher. I need nothing now.
Is all well at Pointe du Lac
tonight?
Yvette draws closer.

Light reveals her beauty.

YVETTE
We worry about you, master. When
do you ride the fields? How long
is it since you've been to the
slave quarters? Have you seen the
new baby born to Charlotte? Why
do you let the overseer whip so
many so often? Always before you
looked after us.
Louis listens, but in spite of himself he is getting
hungry. Yvette looks more and more succulent. Throat
long and slender. Skin gorgeous.
LOUIS
(dazed monotone)
Leave me alone now, Yvette.
out.

Go

YVETTE
I will not go unless you listen to
me. Send away this new friend of
yours. This Monsieur de Lioncourt.
The slaves are frightened of him.
They are frightened of you.
LOUIS' POV
She approaches the table, skin gleaming, but her voice is
no longer audible, only her beating heart. As she places
her hands on the table to lean forward, she sees the dead
rat lying on the tablecloth.
BACK TO SCENE
Louis' hunger crests.
Yvette, staring at the rat and then at Louis, starts to
scream. He upsets the wine glass as he rises and clamps
his hand over her mouth.
The GLASS rolls to the floor and BREAKS.
In horror, he realizes he has accidentally broken her
neck. He stares at her dead eyes, and he is
griefstricken.

For one moment he is tempted to drink her blood, then
horrified by the incestuous and monstrous idea. He
cradles her as he would a precious friend, overcome with
grief.
LOUIS
Yvette, my poor faithful Yvette.
EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT
Louis watches the body of Yvette sink deep into the muck.
He is utterly dejected. He hears SOUNDS, turns, sees
slaves at a distance spying on him.
He walks back to:
EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS
A row of brightly lighted little pitched roof bungalows.
Not turning his head he walks past the slaves in the
darkness of the porches as all greet him softly with a
Bonsoir, Michie. He makes no answer. He stands looking
at:
MANSION OF POINTE DU LAC
The rich house with all candelabra and chandeliers
lighted, all windows open. He stands rapt by the vision.
Behind him slaves gather, uneasy, whispering.
Suddenly galvanized, Louis rushes up the stairs, snatches
up the candelabra and sets fire to the drapes. He goes
from window to window doing it.
SLAVES' POV - MASTER
setting fire to the house.
BACK TO SCENE
They rush up the stairs, with shouts of "Stop him, he's
mad."
INT. BEDROOM
Louis stands surrounded by flames, ready to be consumed.
The night is full of SHOUTS and SCREAMS and the plantation BELL CLANGING. GLASS BREAKS. Louis turns to see -(CONTINUED)

as he looks beyond at the paling sky.

Louis squints

LESTAT
You fool, what have you done?
LOUIS
It's almost sunrise. You promised
me that the sun or the fire could
kill me! Now leave me, save
yourself.
Lestat pulls Louis' left arm around his shoulder, as if
hefting a drunken companion. Carrying Louis, he rushes
out on the porch and leaps over the railing to the ground.
He climbs on his horse, lifting Louis before him. Louis
covers his eyes as the barest light of morning fills the
sky. He slumps forward over the horse's neck.
Slaves rush towards them, but Lestat drives them back
effortlessly with several swipes of his riding crop and
rides out the road and out the gates. The sky is violet
with the coming dawn.
EXT. LARGE GRAVEYARD
With many large crypts. Louis, now unable to uncover his
face, is being carried over Lestat's shoulder.
LOUIS'S POV
Passing crypts, light coming in orange flashes.
RUSTED HINGES. Then darkness.

Sound of

INT. CRYPT
Louis is flung down on the floor of a large crypt.
Lestat fits the iron door back into place and secures it.
The gleaming burning light is gone.
Where are we?

LOUIS
LESTAT
Where do you think, Louis? We're
in a nice filthy cemetery. Does
this make you happy? Is this
fitting and proper enough?
Louis laughs softly.

LOUIS
We belong in hell.
LESTAT
And what if there is no hell, or
they don't want us there? Ever
think about that?
Lestat lies down in the shadows beside him.
LESTAT
(defeated)
Never mind, don't answer.
Sometimes this is close enough
to hell as it is.
INT. INN (NEW ORLEANS)
Lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy
French furniture. Open window to rooftops of colonial
city.
Louis is in fresh clothes and sits calmly in a chair.
Lestat before the mirror fusses with his lace collar.
LOUIS
Why did you bother to save me?
You can make another. Someone
better than me.
LESTAT
You're too strong. That's your
trouble. You feel too deeply.
You see too much.
LOUIS
You spoke of old ones, you said
in time they went mad. Is that
what will happen to you and to
me?
LESTAT
Some do, some don't. There are
legends of those who've lived
for a millennia. Why can't we
live for eternity. We have the
chance!
Lestat pauses, perplexed, plunged into thought.

LOUIS
I'm leaving you. I've
disappointed you, Lestat. And
there's no reason for me to
remain. You have no need of me.
You never did.
Lestat looks sad.
LESTAT
(compassionately)
And where are you going? You
think you'll find others in the
New World? Or will you attempt
the voyage to Europe? Suppose
the ship sinks, Louis, and you
and your coffin are plunged to
the bottom of the sea. You won't
die, you know. You'll lie there,
struggling forever. And you'll
have forever to realize all your
questions were in vain.
Louis rises and moves to the door.
LOUIS
I'm sorry I've failed you. I
told you I wanted it, and I was
wrong. I'm going. Where, how -I don't know the answers. I'll
live from the blood of animals, I
swear it. I shall never take
another human life again. And
I'll search... for what I can't
say...
Lestat shakes his head, trying to suppress his dismissal
of this. He is losing Louis and afraid.
LOUIS
There's nothing more you can
teach me, you've said so yourself.
LESTAT
And you think there are others who
can teach you things? That you'll
find them? You don't understand
about the others. They're lone
predators, jealous of their
territory. They'll see you
coming. You'll be a mark.
LOUIS
All of us lost... lone wolves.

LESTAT
Now that is the truth. And all
we have is the companionship we
can give each other. That's all
anyone has, Louis. Go out, walk
the city streets, peer through
the windows at the couples in
their beds.
Lestat takes Louis by the shoulders and tries to get him
to listen. He hovers like an angel whispering in Louis'
ear.
LESTAT
It's part of our nature to
meditate, to seek, to see through
... to understand.
Louis tries to remain resolute.

Does not reply.

LESTAT
We are creatures of the earth, my
friend. And yes, like a thousand
other species we kill so we may
live. This world is a savage
garden. We're no different from
other beasts of prey.
Louis looks at Lestat.

Sincerely:

LOUIS
Adieu, Lestat. I'm sorry.
LESTAT
In the old world, they called it
the dark gift, Louis. And I
gave it to you.
LOUIS
I know. Forgive me. It was all
an error, a tragic error from the
start.
EXT. STREET (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT
Deserted narrow muddy streets of small, pitched roof
bungalow cottages. Louis walks alone, seeing things in a
daze.
He sees a white X marked on an empty house.
A MAN with a lantern lifts it as he passes.

MAN
Don't go that way, monsieur. It's
the plague, monsieur. Go back the
way you come.
Louis smiles at those words, repeating them softly.
LOUIS
... the way I came.
He walks on. More houses marked with X's. MOANS and
CRYING come from the houses. Sometimes only the sound
of someone GASPING for BREATH.
A black cat darts past Louis. Crazed with hunger, he
stares at it, watches it speed away. He trembles. He
walks on.
A CHILD'S CRYING becomes LOUDER and LOUDER. Gradually,
we realize it's a child of perhaps six, crying in
exhaustion and fear. It is coming from a dark house.
Louis pauses before the house.

The child is sobbing.

CLAUDIA (CHILD) (O.S)
'Mama, please, wake up. Mama,
I'm frightened, please...

CLAUDIA, in a ragged little gown tugs at the dead body of
her mother, crying softly and wearily.

Her eyes are being eaten away

BACK TO SCENE
Louis gasps in horror.
Claudia turns. She is a radiant doll or angel as she
stretches out her hands to Louis.
CLAUDIA
Monsieur, please, help us. We
have to get to the ship. My
papa's waiting for us. Please,
monsieur, help me. Wake Mamma,
please.
Louis stares past her at the dead mother.

Instinctively, he gathers the child to him, protectively,
looking back at the spectacle of the mother's face
swarming with ants.
Claudia chokes and sobs against his shoulder.
He turns her face upward looking at her, stricken with
pity, and then the hunger glazes his eyes. Her crying
becomes louder yet ever more distant, and we see only
her beauty, her cheek, her throat.
Louis closes his eyes, hand touching her throat, and
slowly he bends to kiss it, and then we see his fangs for
one instant as he eases them into the flesh.
The CRYING DIES away as Louis goes into the swoon.
Gradually another sound replaces it.
LESTAT'S LAUGHTER, GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER and more
distinct.
Suddenly, Louis breaks away, caught redhanded, the child
in his arms. He sees Lestat laughing in the doorway,
pointing at him, slapping his knee, and laughing again.
LESTAT
Ah, my philosopher, my martyr.
'Never take a human life again.'
Well, really, you must admit it's
terribly funny. Or is it merely
touching? I'm not sure.
Louis stares down at the unconscious Claudia in horror,
then lets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he
wipes at his mouth, sees the streak of blood on the back
of his hand, and the tiny wounds on her throat.
Lestat rushes past him. He snatches up the dead mother
from the bed, and begins to dance with her in great
circles, humming and talking. Her head falls back.
Black water flows from her mouth.
LESTAT
Well, let's make a party of it
shall we? The child's still alive,
Louis. Look at her, you've left
some life in her, and some blood
too.
Louis flees into the street.
Lestat runs behind him.

Men with cart of corpses pass by, peering into each
house.
LESTAT
Come back, Louis. Come back.

Louis runs.

Lestat follows taunting him.

LESTAT
Louis, do you want me to go back
for her?
Louis scales a wall and runs from rooftop to rooftop,
Lestat following him easily, dancing alongside of him.
LESTAT
Oh, come on, it's not so very
shameful! She'd have died of the
plague if you hadn't taken her.
Oh, Merciful Death, how you do
love your precious guilt.
Louis turns on Lestat and attacks him with all his
strength. They fight, Louis again and again assaulting
bravely, Lestat easily blocking the blows.
Finally Lestat's hand rises.

Snow storm.
LESTAT (V.O.)
We were country lords. Proud,
penniless, the old order who never
went to Paris to wait hand and foot
upon the king. If I didn't hunt, we
starved in our ancestral castle.
INT. GREAT HALL
Three tradesmen from the village stand with platters of
hot food before -Lestat, a crudely dressed Robin Hood style lord, dappled
with snow, walks in with two slain wild rabbits over his
shoulder. Stops, sees the laden table, and acknowledges
the tradesmen with a bow.

Lestat approaches her, lays down the game, and then
kisses her on the mouth.
Lestat and GABRIELLE gesture for the tradesmen to place
the food on the table, and we see -LESTAT'S FATHER
blind, dignified, seated at the table, making a grandoise
gesture of acceptance as the villagers back away. Two
brothers also watch stiffly and uncomfortably, giving the
villagers nods of thanks.
Lestat leaves with the villagers, talking together,
escorting them to the doors. They talk.
LESTAT (V.O.)
And when a pack of wolves began
terrifying the villagers, it was
I who had to hunt and kill them.
I was the only one left who could
sit a horse, the only Lord who
could hunt our ancestral lands.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED VALLEY
Lestat, in crude garments, with crude weapons -- flail,
old broad sword, musket in its belt, flintlock rifle -rides his mare through the deep snow. Behind him plod
two giant mastiffs with spiked collars.
LESTAT
(singing)
Come out, brother wolf. I'm
waiting. I'm waiting for you all.
Whistles as he rides on, enjoying wind and blue sky.
Two wolves appear, rushing from the dark woods towards
him.
Lestat is galvanized, takes aim with FLINTLOCK RIFLE and
brings one down as the other charges and kills one dog.
Lestat has no time to reload. He aims the MUSKET, wounds
the wolf, but the dog is dead. Then to his horror -Three more wolves suddenly come running from far ahead.
LESTAT (V.O.)
It was an ambush. They are such
clever animals. And I should have
known. I'd hunted them before.
Lestat fights at the wolves with his sword, killing a
third, as the other one attacks and kills his other dog.
The wounded wolf and the last of the five come back,
charging him, striking his horse, and wounding the
horse's hind quarters so that it falls.
Lestat slips out of the saddle. He grabs the flail from
his belt. He strikes the wounded wolf and kills it. The
last wolf, very canny, merely watches him.
Lestat looks at the nearby forest. It's too far. The
branches are too high. Nevertheless he backs towards
it, staring down the wolf who begins to pace.
Lestat turns and starts to run.

The wolf chases.

Lestat pivots and rams the sword right through the wolf's
throat. In exhaustion he collapses, arm over the warm
body of the wolf, staring back at...

His HORSE emitting terrible WHINNIES as it tries to stand
up but cannot.
LESTAT (V.O.)
How did I slain the entire pack?
Another man might have lost his
life then. It seemed the greatest
victory, but afterwards it came
to mean so much more.
Lestat reloads his MUSKET and executes his horse.
Bitter. Heartbroken.

Thank you, Antoine, thank you all.
Lestat turns, sees four villagers filling the table with
meat and drink.
As villagers leave, Lestat slumps into a huge medieval
style chair by the fire.
Gabrielle comes to him. He rises, but she bids him to
stay seated and she sits on the broad arm of the chair.
He is alarmed at her pale appearance. He goes to kiss
her. She pushes him away.
GABRIELLE
Listen to me, my youngest and my
dearest. Listen well. I know
why you don't leave here...
LESTAT
(resigned)
I'd never leave you, Mother.
Don't talk of such a thing.
She takes gold from her pockets. Lestat is shocked at
the sight of so many real gold coins.

GABRIELLE
This is all I have left of my
family's money. You're to take
it, do you hear me? You're to go
to Paris and make your fortune.
Lestat tries to protest.
GABRIELLE
(forcefully)
Lestat, I'm dying. I can't live
through another winter. Now you
must do this for me. Go to Paris
so that I know you are happy and
away from here as my eyes close.
Again, Lestat tries to protest.

LESTAT (V.O.)
I could hardly bear to leave her.
But I couldn't deny her either.
That she knew.
Gabrielle kisses him, slightly intimate for mother and
sone, but very full of love.
RETURN TO INN
Lestat talking to Louis who is rapt.
LESTAT
It was the boulevard theatres I
went to. I loved them. No decent
lord would have ever acted upon a
stage but what did that matter to
me? Thanks to my mother I was
free.
INT. RENAUD'S THEATRE
Lestat in the red cloak with its wolf lining, cavorts
before the audience as the younger lover in the play. He
winks as he chases the beautiful heroine. A buffoonish
old man with a fake nose suddenly blusters between them,
grabbing the heroine, who takes one look at him and flees
into Lestat's arms.
Roars of laughter from the audience.

CLOSE ON LESTAT'S FACE
as he sees in the audience, third row:
MAGNUS
A skull-like visage with dark, gleaming eyes, watching
him from beneath a dark hood of black velvet.
LESTAT
in a trance senses danger.
SOUNDS OF AUDIENCE GROW FAINT.
CLOSE ON MAGNUS
Wolf killer.

MAGNUS (V.O.)
SOUNDS OF THEATRE GROW FAINTER.

Magnus smiles.

LESTAT
breaks into a sweat.
LOUIS (V.O.)
He could read minds as you could.
Oh, yes!

LESTAT (V.O.)

INT. ATTIC ROOM (PARIS) - NIGHT
Lestat and two actresses and actors sleep on pallets on
the floor. Snow falls outside. Lestat wakes, shivering,
hearing.
Wolf killer.

MAGNUS (V.O.)
The WINDOW SHATTERS. Lestat is dragged by a hooded
figure out of the bed, out of the window and up into the
swirling snow. He fights like mad, even biting at the
white hand that holds him. We hear Magnus's LAUGHTER.
The HOWLING STORM.

INT. TOWER ROOM - FUNERAL PYRE
Lestat newly made a vampire with blood on his lips
watches in terror as Magnus, leaping about like a spider
monkey, sets fire to the pyre and then ascends.
LOUIS (V.O.)
He told you nothing.
LESTAT (V.O.)
Only where I might find my coffin,
and how I must find it. And that
he'd left me the tower and all his
wealth.
LOUIS (V.O.)
He thought you were strong.
Lestat wanders through the dungeon of the tower. Comes
to a cell where he sees something which horrifies him.
LESTAT (V.O.)
And I was strong. I'd fought him
through every step of it. That
must have been why he had let me
live. Because there had been
others, lots of others whom he had
chosen and then allowed to die.
Lestat grabs the bars of the cell, staring at what's
inside.
CLOSE ON GREAT HEAP OF BODIES OF YOUNG BLOND-HAIRED MEN
Some long dead, some recently dead. All resemble Lestat.
All have his height, coloring, even similar garments. And
the most recent corpse, swarming with flies, has blue eyes!
Lestat backs up, doubled over with nausea and vomits a
stream of blood onto the stones. Stunned, he stares at
the blood and instinctively, arches his back and reaches
down and laps it back up with his tongue.
Realizing what he is doing, he rises, slamming back into
the bars, against the corpses and then he lets out a roar.
It is like the roar we have already heard from Louis in
the swamp. It echoes throughout the dungeon and the tower.
EXT. BOULEVARDS (PARIS)
Lestat, a vampire, beautifully dressed in brocade and lace,
walks through the crowds of jugglers, vendors, ladies of
the street, city strollers and stops at Renaud's Theatre.
He watches from a distance, as the crowds go in.

LESTAT (V.O.)
Of course I learned how to hunt
instinctively. That was nothing.
But as for the rest, I was as
confused as you ever were. I
didn't dare return to my mortal
companions. To Gabrielle, my
mother. I sent vague letters
describing my turn of fortune,
and all the money she could
possibly desire. I thought I'd
never lay eyes upon her again.
Lestat turns away from the theatre and goes through the
crowd.
LESTAT (V.O.)
All around me, I could hear the
thoughts of mortals. I always
have been able to hear them. It's
like a chorus of whispers. And in
the midst of that chorus, I was
alone. Until one night, I heard
the voice of a different soul, a
monster like myself.
EXT. PLACE DE GREVE
Lestat stops, listening, wary. A shadowy shape rushes
away from the facade of Notre Dame.
LESTAT (V.O.)
Soon, I heard them often. They
were following me. I could feel
their hatred, and when I glimpsed
them, I saw ragged, filthy little
goblins. Why, they reeked of the
dirt of the grave!
EXT. DOORS OF NOTRE DAME (PARIS)
Lestat rushes toward them as a little band of ragged
vampires in rags hurries silently after him. He sees
them up on the roofs. He rushes into the:
CHURCH
He peers back out at them with curiosity and contempt.
Three little vampires hang out in the shadows trying to
keep an eye on him.

A man passes before the cathedral with a lantern and the
three vampires run cowering from the light.
LESTAT (V.O.)
It was very easy to elude them.
All I had to do was seek shelter
of a church. They were afraid to
go into them! They ran from
crosses. They ran from the light.
RETURN TO:
INN (NEW ORLEANS)
Louis listens rapt, as Lestat talks, walking back and
forth.
LESTAT
I soon realized they lived in the
cemetery of Les Innocents. It's
long gone, that place. But in
those days it was in the heart of
Paris.
EXT. LES INNOCENTS CEMETERY
Gigantic place full of many crypts. Three vampires dart
through the darkness and disappear through a crypt door.
LESTAT (V.O.)
They inhabited the catacombs
beneath the cemetery. And they
believed the cross could hurt
them, that holy water would burn
them, they believed it, do you
understand?
LOUIS (V.O.)
Yes, I can understand it.
RETURN TO:
INN (NEW ORLEANS)
Lestat talking to Louis.
LESTAT
All that superstition. And I, the
orphan was breaking all their
rules, because I didn't know there
were any rules at all.
RETURN TO:

INT. BALLROOM TUIELIERES (PARIS)
Lestat in dim light dances with a mortal woman.
LESTAT (V.O.)
What was it they later accused me
of? Ah, yes, walking in the
places of light. I didn't serve
the devil properly as they saw it.
I tempted the fiend to drag me
down into hell for my sins. And
of course, there was another
thing. I'd made a companion soon
after. And broken more of their
rules when I'd done that.
EXT. ILE ST. LOUIS
Lestat on horseback rides over bridge behind Notre Dame
and stops before a mansion, anxious, looking up at a
lighted window.

He rushes past attendants up stairs.

journey to Paris was the hardest
thing I'd ever done.

LESTAT (CONT'D)
Yet with the wealth I showered
upon her -- the wealth Magnus had
given me -- she accomplished the
one thing I never expected. She
made the journey to Paris to see
her son for the last time.
Lestat stops before a bedroom door.
A NURSE emerges gesturing for him to be quiet.
NURSE
Madame is very ill. Yet she is
dressed and waiting to see you.
All day we've waited for you! Do
you think death waits on every
spoilt young lord?
Lestat is anguished. Slowly he goes into the room. He
stands in the shadows. In the light of a candle, we see:
Gabrielle, his mother, pale and very sick obviously, yet
beautifully dressed and seated in a gilded armchair by
the big heavily-draped bed. She is almost too weak to
rise.
GABRIELLE
Lestat, oh, my darling... Come
into the light where I can see
you.
Lestat remains in the shadows.
LESTAT
Put out the candle, Mother. I was
a pauper when last you saw me. I
might dazzle you now.

So were we all, my darling, before
your good fortune. It is you I
came to see. Not your fine
clothes.

She pinches out the candle.

Only light comes through

GABRIELLE
Please, come to me. Let me take
you in my arms.

Lestat draws nearer, trancelike.
LESTAT (V.O.)
How could I tell her? How could
I explain I wasn't her son
anymore, that this is what I'd
become? You know what you see
with your vampire eyes. Imagine
the sight of her to me with my
new vision. She was dying. She
could not have lived another
week, perhaps not another night.
And her thoughts, I could hear
them. She was afraid of dying!
That's why she'd come to me.
She'd thought it would be easier
with me there!
Lestat in anguish draws nearer. Gabrielle struggles to
her feet, eyes full of tears and reaches out. As she
touches him, she realizes he's not human anymore. She
falls back, losing her balance, grabbing for the bedpost.
Lestat stares at her sadly.
LESTAT (V.O.)
Countless mortals I'd deceived in
the ballrooms and the theatres,
in the boulevards and the cafes.
But I could not deceive her. She
knew the moment that she touched
my skin. What could I do but
explain to her silently, making
her see it in images, that I
hadn't chosen it, that it had
been done to me, against my will.

GABRIELLE

Gabrielle opens her arms just as she is about to fall
from weakness. Lestat enfolds her in his arms, lovingly,
sinks his teeth into her throat and enters a swoon. They
embrace tightly. As she weakens he wakes her and slashing his own throat with his fingernail puts her lips to
it and she begins to suck his blood. Again, he closes
his lips on her wound. They make a cycle, each drawing
blood from the other. Sound of HEARTBEAT. Sound of
DRUM.
Gabrielle steps back, wiping the blood from her lips,
transformed.
EXT. ROOFTOPS
Gabrielle and Lestat hurry over the roofs together. They
drop down on the top of a passing coach, laughing, holding tight to each other.
EXT. HOTEL PARTICULEIR (PARIS) - NIGHT
Gabrielle is dressed as a man now, standing over a corpse
from which she took the clothes. She ties her hair in a
long pigtail with the dead man's ribbon and taking Lestat
by the arm they walk off together.
GABRIELLE
Now, don't look so heartbroken.
There's no reason for me to wear
skirts any longer.
Lestat reaches for her long hair.
LESTAT
Just... don't cut your hair,
Mother. Do that for me, don't
cut your hair.

that word, Mother. Let it go with
the mortal coil. And if the hair
means so much to you, very well.
Gabrielle kisses him.

BACK TO:

INN (NEW ORLEANS) - LESTAT
He smiles sadly at the amazed Louis.
LESTAT
Yes, my mother. I am such a
devil. If you were I, would you
have let her die?
LOUIS
I don't know. But she was the
strong companion you needed, that
much is plain.
LESTAT
You think so? But how this
angered the ragged coven beneath
Les Innocents! I had broken the
rule of all rules. Being a
bastard was one thing. Making
another of one's own mother, why,
you'd think I'd trampled on the
Sacred Host itself.
INT. LES INNOCENTS
The ragged coven of twelve vampires surround Lestat and
Gabrielle. Gabrielle is in her male garb with her hair
in a braid. The vampires hold torches with which they
taunt the pair. Gabrielle clings to Lestat but she is as
grimly angry as he is.
ARMAND, a boy with an angel's face and auburn curling
hair appears. He points a denouncing finger at Lestat.
LESTAT
What devil do you serve? Where is
he? Who says that you cannot go
into the cathedral of Notre Dame,
if you want to? That you must live
here in filth among the old bones!

ARMAND
(gently, sadly)
Blasphemer. We are the devil's
children.
LESTAT
You're a pack of fools.
Suddenly he remembers something. He drags a jeweled
rosary out of his pockets. The vampires gasp and back
away.
GABRIELLE
Look, he took it from one of his
victims. He's stolen a hundred.
The cross has no power.
She snatches the rosary from Lestat and dangles the cross
in the light of the torches.
GABRIELLE
These are but superstitions. You
are as deluded as mortals. More
deluded. Who in the Paris above
you believes in God as you
believe?

Armand is being mentally and

LESTAT (V.O.)
Don't you see? I was the first
one among them to discover that
these old curses didn't matter.
A bunch of monks and nuns, that's
what they were, Satan's
mendicants. And it was all
nonsense.
LOUIS (V.O.)
But had they all believed it?
Every one?
LESTAT (V.O.)
No. Their leader, Armand. The
Botticelli angel with the dark
red hair. Oh, how deceptive was
that innocent face! He had been
taught it.
(MORE)

LESTAT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And he had believed in it, which
was far worse than believing it.
That's why he had always ordered
the destruction of any heretic
or rogue outside the coven.
Armand steps forward, obviously issuing judgment.
Gabrielle draws close to Lestat as the torches ring them.
Lestat in desperation looks at ELENI, a ragged, halfnaked vampire woman who comes at him with a torch.
LESTAT
And you, ma cherie, what has the
devil done for you of late, that
you should serve him so
devotedly? Ah, but you'd look so
pretty if only you'd let me fit
you in a proper dress.
Eleni is startled, lowers the torch.

Others cry

"Burn them."
Lestat turns to a tall boy of twenty or so -- Laurent.
LESTAT
And you? How many years have you
endured the smell of death in
your nostrils? Wouldn't you like
to walk with me for an hour along
the boulevard? Perhaps sit for
a while among mortals in a warm
cafe?
Lestat turns this way and that. The vampires are losing
their nerve. They turn to Armand.
LESTAT
Why, some of you are cold! We
need never be cold. Why have you
no hearth here?
Armand does nothing. He appears brokenhearted, sad. As
we CLOSE ON him, he turns his back slowly on the proceedings. Eleni throws aside the torch.
ELENI
You can take me into the
cathedral?

LESTAT
Yes, once you're bathed and
propertly attired. I could take
you to Versailles.
Whispers, murmurs from the confused vampires.
GABRIELLE
Come with us, all of you. We'll
show you. The lights of the night
have no power. By day, we must
sleep in the dark of course, but
once the sun sets, we are free to
hunt and do as we please.
The vampires degenerate into loud quarreling.
Suddenly Lestat seizes the torch from Laurent and
Gabrielle snatches up the torch that Eleni has let drop
to the dirt floor.
Lestat and Gabrielle flee, brandishing the torches.

to the top of the wall, and dashing away.
RETURN TO:
INT. INN (NEW ORLEANS) - LESTAT
He looks dejected.
LESTAT
They soon scattered. The coven
was destroyed. Armand, the devil
with the angel's face, he
destroyed most of them because
they could not survive without
him, and he could no longer lead.

INT. LIBRARY (PARIS) - CLOSE ON ARMAND
dressed now as a French gentleman, standing in a lavish
library in Paris. He is addressing Lestat who stands by
the fireplace, equally well-dressed.
ARMAND
(gently)
You were our ruin. You drove us
out of Eden with your burning
sword.
LESTAT
You were in purgatory. What do
you want of me! All I did was
tell you the truth!
ARMAND
And what was that? That there is
no truth to be known? Our beliefs
were our strength, our survival.
They were our citadel against
time.
LESTAT
Lies? Lies can't be the strength
of anyone. We are monsters. So
are mortals. If we cannot face
the truth we are lost.
ARMAND
Stop speaking of the truth as
though it were something. It is
nothing.
LESTAT
Oh no, you're wrong. The truth is
in the flesh, in the beauty we see,
in the blood we drink. It's in
the mystery of the rainfall, and
the clouded sky, the flight of a
lone bird over the sea.
He pauses, entranced for a moment with the beauty of
Armand himself. He reaches out, touches Armand's cheek.
LESTAT
How many centuries lie behind this
radiant face?
He pulls Armand to the window and points down into the
crowded Paris street. A mob is surging by.

LESTAT
Do you hear them, they're
screaming for the death of King
Louis and his Queen, Marie
Antoinette.
ARMAND
What do I care what they want?
LESTAT
The old order has fallen for them.
It's fallen for you as well. Make
a new order as they must make it.
ARMAND
Ah, but you know so little,
fledgling. With your jewels, and
your velvet, and your shining
sword. You think it will be easy
to see everything you love
disintegrate and crumble away?
LESTAT
The blood, the warmth, the love...
that is what will keep me
immortal.
ARMAND
Gabrielle. Your companion. She
gives you what you require. That
is why you say all these things.
But will she remain with you
always? You cannot read her
thoughts, can you? Though you
can read mine?
Lestat looks afraid.
ARMAND
But you could before you took her
in that lovely bedroom on the Ile
St. Louis, is that not so? You
could know her soul as I know
yours now.
Lestat refuses to answer Armand, but we hear:
LESTAT (V.O.)
He was right. Gabrielle's mind
had been closed to me from the
moment my blood had filled her
veins. As closed as your mind is
to me now.

ARMAND
It's always so with master and
fledgling. You can hear other
children of darkness, you can
commune with mortals. But we
master and fledgling are divided.
We must speak to and reach out
for each other. And with no vows
to bind her, she will tire of you,
your mother. She tires of you
already. She has never needed
anyone, your mother. She is
harder than you!
LESTAT
Stop!
ARMAND
Oh, you'll make others. You'll
seek for better, more genial
companions. But it will always
be the same. They'll turn on you.
They'll leave you. They may even
hate you for making them. Our
service to Satan has held us
together. You have nothing, and
you will go into the fire some
night as the old ones have always
done.
Never.
ECHO.

Never.

LESTAT
Never...

Armand looks sadly after Lestat and then sadly at all the
books on the shelves. He stands back and with the power
of his mind makes the books suddenly fall in heaps all
over. They cascade to the floor from all the surrounding
walls.
Lestat is afraid of this show of telepathic power, but
angry that he is afraid.
Armand smiles sadly.
ARMAND
Patience. All these little skills
come... if you last long enough!
LESTAT
Get out of here. Get away from me.

maledictions.

anxiously.

Gabrielle becomes visible, in fancy male dress, hair
braided down her back. She is merely watching. She and
Lestat exchange glances.
LESTAT
He's right, isn't he? You dream
of being free of me already.
You've had no need of me since
our enemies were destroyed.
Grabrielle opens her arms to him.
GABRIELLE
(kissing his cheek)
To love and to need -- these are
different things. And what does
it matter if some night we decide
to part for a little while?
Backs up, smiling, with deliberate reassurance:
GABRIELLE
It's too soon now to speak of it,
anyway. Let's go out into the
crowd.
They walk down the corridor together:
GABRIELLE
Let me tell of my most recent
discovery. Last night I abandoned
the coffin. I slept in the earth
itself.
But how?

LESTAT
GABRIELLE
I dug deep beneath the ground,
and when the sun set I rose as a
swimmer rising to the surface of
the sea.
Lestat is fascinated.

LESTAT
So the coffin has no magic power.
It is pure darkness which we
require.
GABRIELLE
We should leave Paris. I'm tired
of it already. Tired of all these
mortals. I long for exotic places
which I have never seen.
They go out into Paris streets.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. INN (NEW ORLEANS)
Lestat sits at the table staring away from Louis.
Silence.

Then...
LESTAT
I could have told you Armand's
lies. That we were the children
of darkness, that we travel the
Devil's Road. That Satan is our
master. I could have used a
pinch of stolen incense when I
made you. And Latin mumbo jumbo.
Instead I made up a little test
for you, that you kill that tavern
maid. And then I told you... what
I've seen for myself.

Lestat looks searchingly at Louis.
LOUIS
(compassionately)
But Gabrielle. Where is she?
Surely she didn't leave you. Not
in hatred and coldness as Armand.
Louis shakes his head, disapproving.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAIN SIDE - FOREST
Lestat and Gabrielle dressed in fur garments walk, arm
in arm. Then they stop and part and Gabrielle moves on
alone...

LESTAT (V.O.)
Where is she, tonight? I can not
imagine. What continent, what
nation, what wilderness does she
roam? She was always the lone one.
That was the argument. We never
hated each other. We love each
other even now. It's only that
she sought the wilderness -- the
forests and the mountains. And I
could scarcely bear it. I need
the cities, the lights, the
mortals around me, the things
which men and women have built.
INT. INN (NEW ORLEANS)
LOUIS
And a companion... at least one of
our kind.
Lestat nods, admitting it defiantly.
LESTAT
Yes -- not to be the only one
among all the others, not to
know... love.
LOUIS
And when she left you, you came to
the New World.
Lestat reflects; decides not to answer directly.
LESTAT
(impishly)
Well, I couldn't stay in Paris.
Armand's power was incalculable.
And there were too many others
left in Paris. I loathe them,
really. And you would too.
LOUIS
What do they do now?
LESTAT
What we do. Wander the savage
garden in pairs or little
families. Same thing mortals do,
really. The world's enough to
drive mortals mad if they think
about it. You ought to know.

Louis smiles.
LOUIS
Yes, on that I agree with you.
LESTAT
And... besides...
(smiles)
They said it couldn't be done,
that no vampire had ever crossed
the great sea. And so I did! As
soon as I could book passage for
myself a great ebony coffin!
Lestat laughs.

Louis smiles sadly.

LOUIS
How could I pass up a challenge
such as that?
LESTAT
Exactly. That's when I learned
to live off rats. And drunken
sailors. Never forget the little
drink. It tortures me, but then
I like being teased... well, for a
little while.
LOUIS
And the ship did not sink, of
course.
Lestat shrugs.
LESTAT
What if it had? I can swim better
than a shark. Would you like to
swim the river some night, the
two of us together? I've done it.
I'll race you to the far bank.
Louis shakes his head, no.
LOUIS
You made one error in judgement,
however.
Oh?

LESTAT
What was that.

LOUIS
When you found yourself alone
again -- the only one -- you were
a little more desperate than
before.

LESTAT
I picked you carefully and
deliberately, Louis. And I've
always found it boring... to be
alone.
LOUIS
(nodding)
Yes, that I understand as well.
LESTAT
Have patience with your
weaknesses. All our powers
increase with age. When the old
ones give you their blood, which
they can when they choose, they
give you greater strength.
LOUIS
Have you drunk the blood of old
ones? Have you...? Did you?
Did Armand...
Lestat interrupts.
LESTAT
Don't let's talk of Armand. It
gives me a mortal headache to
think of Armand. Besides,
reading minds -- it's not such a
blessing as you might think. I
don't like knowing when other
vampires despise me, or when
mortals find me ugly or don't
even notice me at all!
LOUIS
As if that ever happens to you!
Lestat preens at the compliment, and shrugs.
stands up.

Suddenly he

LESTAT
Come, not only do I hear the
mortals about me, I breathe their
scent. I hunger for them. We'll
hunt together. I won't let you
hate me so soon. I won't let
Armand be proved right, do you
hear me?

LOUIS
I want him to be wrong. For your
sake. But I can't bear this,
Lestat. And you know it now.
Choose another, and let me go.
Lestat smiles seductively.
LESTAT
But Louis, you haven't tried!

A coach rushes by.

Partygoers pass them.

Pain is terrible for you. You

because you are a vampire. You
don't want it to go on.
No...

LOUIS
LESTAT
Do what it is your nature to do.
And you will feel as you felt with
her in your arms, your little
child.

Wed to her, and weightless as if
in a dance.

That and more.
Lestat looks about, gets his bearing, is seized by an
idea. He takes Louis's hand.
He leads Louis as if searching for some specific place.
LESTAT
Evil is a point of view. Armand

my beloved mother never forgot it.

never know without regret!
Louis almost winces in pain at the accuracy of it.

Lestat

LIGHTED BUILDINGS
Lestat speaks while searching each with his gaze.
LESTAT
God kills, and so shall we. For
no creatures under God are as we
are, none so like him as
ourselves...
LOUIS
Yes, merciless and greedy and cruel.
That I do believe.
Louis looks at the stars.

He is soothed by the breeze.

LESTAT
Ah, but we have even more in
common with our creator. Come, I
am like a mother tonight. I want
a child.
Louis is baffled.

He follows as Lestat enters --

LONG COLONIAL HOSPICE OR SHELTER
with rows of wooden beds. Children moan and cry beneath
the covers. One nurse and one doctor attend, each with
candle in hand.
Lestat peers into the shadows.
LESTAT
She's there, your wounded one!
LOUIS
What are you saying? What is this
place? These are foundlings,
starving children...
Intrigued and seduced, he watches as Lestat moves fast
down the ward, and points to Claudia, pale and unconscious on the bed.

Louis recognizes her.
The doctor approaches Lestat. The doctor wraps the
sleeping child up in her little white blanket, as Lestat
takes money from his pockets and flings it on the bed.
Many gold coins.
LOUIS
(whispers)
Lestat, what are you doing?
Lestat is murmuring politely to the doctor, who is bowing.
Lestat turns and hurries silently past Louis, with Claudia
asleep on his shoulder. Louis hurries after him into the
night.
LOUIS
Lestat!
EXT. DARK STREET
We see only dim figures and the white blanket as if it
were flying through the dark like magic.
INT. INN - SUPPER ROOM
Bedroom as before.

Candle on the table.

Lestat lays Claudia gently on the coverlet of the bed.
Louis draws near, looking down at her, stricken by her
beauty and her fragility.
LESTAT
(gently)
You haven't fed yet at all tonight.
And last night you took so little.
LOUIS
No. Don't demand this of me.
Don't make me do this. It's too
like your old Paris coven. No
rituals between us.
But he cannot take his eyes off Claudia who tosses in
half sleep.
LESTAT
See how plump and sweet she is,
still. Even death can't take her
freshness. The will to live in
her was so strong. Death might
make a sculpture of her tiny lips
and rounded hands, but he cannot
make her fade!

CLOSE ON LOUIS
becoming desperate with hunger and anguish.
Lestat whispers in his ear, compassionately.
LESTAT
You remember, how you wanted her,
the taste of her...
LOUIS
I didn't want to kill her.
But he is overcome with the memory of the ecstasy.
HIS POV - CLOSE ON CLAUDIA
Claudia is lifted towards him, slipped into his arms.
LOUIS (O.S.)
Poor cherie, no chance...
LESTAT (O.S.)
No chance at all.
BACK TO SCENE
Louis closes his eyes as he caresses her, holding her
cheek against his own and kissing her forehead, very
paternal. And then he opens his eyes and looks at her
neck, and sees the traces of the wound of last night and
he becomes a ravenous vampire, and slowly, gently sinks
his teeth once more, careful not to hurt her.
LESTAT
(whisper)
Just a little tear. It's just a
little throat.
Louis moans as he sinks into the swoon. HEARTBEAT.
DRUMS. The ECHO of Claudia's crying from the night
before. His hand cradles her head tenderly. He is like
a father kissing a child.
So strong.

LOUIS
LESTAT
(whispers)
Is she?
The HEARTBEAT and DRUM are getting SLOWER and SLOWER.

Suddenly Louis opens his eyes in shock as Lestat snatches
the child from him.
LOUIS
For the love of God, let me
finish!
Lestat shakes her, talks to her, staring at her enthralled.
LESTAT
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me.
That's your name, isn't it,
cherie. Claudia! You're ill, my
precious, and I'm going to give
you what you need to get well.
Lestat!

LOUIS
This is sorcery.

Louis lunges at him, but Lestat brushes him aside effortlessly, so that he falls to the floor, from which he rises
at once.
LOUIS
Stop this, now.
Lestat bites his own wrist and presses the bleeding wound
to the child's mouth. He winces in pain.
Louis is fascinated.

Dazzled.

LESTAT
That's it, dear. More.
drink it to get well.

You must

Claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little noises
like a person waking from sleep.
Louis rises to his feet as Claudia clutches Lestat's arm,
sucking the blood fiercely, and Lestat moans.
LESTAT
Stop, that's enough.

No more.

He pulls her loose, as she growls, and she stares at him
with big clear astonished eyes.
I want more.

CLAUDIA
LOUIS
What have you done!

Lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her,
holding his wrist, obviously in pain.
More.

CLAUDIA
LESTAT
Yes, cherie, of course you want
more. And I'll show you how to
get it. Louis, the bell rope.
Pull it.
(to Claudia)
You drink from mortals, my beauty,
but from me? Never again.
LOUIS
(whispers)
Burn in hell!
Impatient, and still suffering, Lestat reaches for the
bell rope himself.
LESTAT
Oh, come now, the child's hungry.
CLOSE ON CLAUDIA
being transformed. Becoming white yet robust, brighteyed yet crazed. She shakes her dusty curls and the dust
falls from them. They are shining in the candlelight.
BACK TO SCENE
Louis cannot stop looking at her.

He does not notice --

As the MAID enters.
MAID
Ah, quelle belle enfant!
The Maid comes near to the bed, kneels in front of Claudia.
Lestat lays his hand on the Maid's throat and Claudia
watches keenly.
LESTAT
Gently, cherie. They are so
innocent. They must not be made
to suffer.
Claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck, very
serious, gnawing, growling slightly, then locking on the
flowing blood.
The Maid is transfixed.

CLOSE ON LOUIS
As we see his anguish, we hear Lestat's voice.
LESTAT (O.S.)
That's enough, cherie. Stop before
the heart stops. It's best in
the beginning, lest the death take
you down with it. Ah, yes, that's
it. My child. My beloved child.
LESTAT AND CLAUDIA
sit on the Louis XVI settee. Claudia is a vision, a doll
made out of pearl. Animated, voice crisp.
CLAUDIA
Where is Mamma?
ANOTHER ANGLE
The words ECHO in Louis's head as he puts his hands to
his ears.
LESTAT
Mamma's gone to heaven, cherie,
same as that sweet lady there.
They all go to heaven. And you
did very well, cherie. Not a
drop spilt. Very good! You're
going to be our child now.
Lestat and Louis exchange glances.

Claudia looks at each

LESTAT
This is Louis, and I'm Lestat.
Lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair.
At once, it curls resiliently. He smiles with delight
and kisses her cheek.
LESTAT
Your mamma's left you with us.
She wants you to be happy. She
knows we can make you happy.
LOUIS
(whisper)
You are the Devil! You are the
instrument of Satan.

LESTAT
(shhh)
Do you want to frighten our little
daughter? What's the matter with
you?
CLAUDIA
I'm not your daughter.
LESTAT
Yes you are, dearest. You are my
daughter and Louis's daughter.
Louis kneels before her as the Maid did. He is struck
with compassion and fascination. It is done and she is
irresistible. He cannot help but reach for her, and hold
her gently as if she were a doll that might break.
Claudia smiles at him.
Lou... eee...

CLAUDIA
Louis is conflicted. He cannot leave her. He touches
her cheek, her hair. Same as his. Vampire skin and hair.
He draws in his breath, shocked at her beauty, and then
he clasps her head again, tenderly kisses her forehead.
His body relaxes as he embraces her, takes her to himself
as a father might a daughter, his eyes closed.
LOUIS
(whispers to Lestat)
You devil, you monster.
Lestat is sort of amazed. He stares at Claudia as though
fascinated by what's happened, and then:
LESTAT
Yes, Claudia dearest, you are
our little daughter. Now whom
should you sleep with? Darkness
and safety are so important.
Perhaps you should sleep with
Louis. After all, when I'm tired
I'm not always... so kind.

MALLOY
He did it to make you stay with
him! He made a vampire of a child!
LOUIS
Perhaps. The answer to why isn't
so simple. Lestat was always the
man of action. And that night
he'd bared his soul to me. He'd
showed me his own weakness, his
own failure.
MALLOY
That Gabrielle had left him.
Armand had been right.

he loved her as much as I loved
her and that was more than words

Lestat stands in the French window, open to the porch,
watching as Louis sits at the desk, his hand idly on an
open book.

Louis reads to Claudia from Moll Flanders. He stops,
tired and sits back.

Here, Louis, let me read to you

LOUIS
But I've never taught you...
CLAUDIA
Well, I don't think it's so very

Louis looks up from the evening paper.

What do you mean you won't be in
the play? Why? Why did you back
out? Tell me.
Lestat sits at the harpsichord and starts fussing through
the music.

LESTAT
I told you, I decided not to do
it.
CLAUDIA
But it wouldn't have been such
fun! They'd have never guessed.
LESTAT
That's just it. It didn't seem
fair, really. It's their realm,
their time... the mortal actors.
Lestat and Louis exchange glances.
CLAUDIA
Fair! To mortals! I've never
heard such nonsense. Lestat,
what is the matter with you?
Lestat deeply distressed begins to play a slow melancholy
tune.
Louis rises and sweeps Claudia up in his arms.
CLAUDIA
What's wrong with both of you?
LOUIS
Great actors have their moods.
Maybe he'll try again sometime.
He carries Claudia down the hall. Glancing back he sees
Lestat sitting with his hands over his face.
Louis carries Claudia down the stairs, and through the
courtyard and out the gate.

Come, let's walk together, we
haven't done it in a long time.

You've never let me see you kill.
Lestat lets me see it all the
time.
Louis is unperturbed.
LOUIS
That's because he's so much better
at it than I am.
They turn on a side street. Flowers pour over garden
wall. Louis grabs a handful of loose blossoms and
sprinkles them over Claudia's hair.
LOUIS
Let me sing a song to you, or tell
you a story. I'm better at that
sort of thing.
She smiles.
Not Macbeth!

Lestat in a fury turns. He drops on his knees, angry
gritting his teeth, but his anger leaves him as he looks
at her. He is suddenly overcome with conflicting
emotions.
In a broken voice he quotes Webster.

She slaps him with the full force of her right hand,
stepping back to see tiny pink imprint of her hand on his
white face. Then it vanishes. He is completely unaffected by the blow otherwise. He merely looks at her. And
then slowly:
He stands up, on the edge of tears, looking down at her,
towering over her.

(comically enraged)
Oh, you little monster! I could
break your pretty neck!
Louis opens his eyes slowly, like a corpse coming back
to life.
Where are we?

LOUIS
What's happening?

LESTAT
The six o'clock novena and
benediction. The church is filled
with people. The Priest is
standing right over our heads.
Louis laughs in spite of himself. Lestat, trying not to
laugh, and still angry, clamps a hand over his mouth.

She hears the LITANY

Veneremur cerniu...
She's frightened. She looks around at Louis and Lestat.
And she tries to stand up but the roof of the crypt won't
allow it. Louis and Lestat sit there, Louis still laughing and Lestat trying to control his temper.
LESTAT
You see what you've done? This
service will go on for two hours!
It's the first time I've been made
to go to church since I was twelve.
Shhh.

LOUIS
You want them to hear us?

LESTAT
And what would they do if they
did?
Claudia is panicking.
SOUND suggestion of dim memory of early church services.
She stares at the skull, at the bones, the splintered
coffin. Claustrophobia. She tries to stand up. Louis
pulls her down.
CLAUDIA
I can't stay in here.

I have to

LESTAT
It was good enough for you last

LOUIS
Claudia, we have no choice but to
wait!
CLAUDIA
I know it. The blessed sacrament
is on the altar!
So what!

LESTAT
Louis can see this is irrational, phobic. He tries to
embrace her. She tries to push up the stone and again
he stops her.

The HYMN CONTINUES ABOVE.
CLAUDIA
I can't stay in here, I tell you!
Louis is confused.
LESTAT
All right, then we shall go out
of here. But we are going to do
it as proper vampires, do you
hear? We will do it in style!
He picks up handfuls of grave dirt and smears it all
over the bewildered Louis and the petrified Claudia.
LESTAT
You have money? Get it out of
your pockets.
Louis and Claudia both find several gold coins.

Claudia rises heaving the stone back.
CLAUDIA, LOUIS AND LESTAT

PRIEST
drops the Monstrance with the blessed sacrament and falls
down. The altar boy screams.
Lestat bares his fangs and gives a great roar, and so does
Claudia who runs for the front door which is open to the
night. She drops the coins. Louis flings them into the
panicstricken congregation as he follows. Lestat howling
and growling, pitches the coins everywhere.
People scream, fall back, scurry to pick up the gold.
PRIEST
The devil and his cohorts throw
money! Catch them!

EXT. CEMETERY - SWAMP BEYOND - NIGHT
Claudia, Louis and Lestat rush into the darkness, up on
top of the cemetery walls, easily outdistancing the few
faithful Catholics following, and soon they are deep into
the swamp.
Lestat slumps down beside a huge cypress, laughing helplessly. Louis is beside him, also laughing, hand on his
shoulder. Claudia stands there. She can't repress a
smile, and then she too laughs, quietly.
CLAUDIA
Well, they'll be talking about
that till the twentieth century!
Lestat and Louis respond with more laughter.
CLAUDIA
The devil throws money!

Indeed.

Lestat climbs to his feet, brushing the dirt off his
clothes.
LESTAT
Look what you've done to me!
hate dirt!

LOUIS
Well, there was no one there who
would ever recognize us, you can
be sure of that!
LESTAT
Not like this! I never looked
like this in my entire endless
life!
(eloquent)
Yuk!
Claudia laughs more freely. Lestat tries to be angry but
he is only pretending. He lets her laugh. They all
laugh.
INT. FLAT - LESTAT
in style of 1840s, comes into Claudia's room. She is
dressed neatly in boy's clothes, and is throwing her
bobbed hair onto the coal fire in the grate.
LESTAT
I loathe that smell.

CLAUDIA
So do I. That's why I do it
before I leave, so that I can
walk away from it.
LESTAT
Well, don't walk out so fast
tonight. I have a surprise for
you.
CLAUDIA
What in God's name could that be?
LESTAT
Come. The workmen have been very
busy in the last few days. You
might have noticed if you were
home anymore with us.
Lestat leads her into the parlor. Louis is waiting. As
Lestat nods, he turns up the wall switch of the new
crystal gaslight chandelier, filling the room with light.
Lestat hurries to turn up the sconces and soon the whole
flat is full of light.
Claudia smiles. She loves it, the vision of light everywhere. So does Louis. Claudia is softened utterly.
LESTAT
No expense spared, my child. The
Quadroon ball room is no better
lighted, or the suites in the
Saint Louis hotel.
CLAUDIA
I do believe you.
Louis watches as Lestat turns away. Claudia watches
Lestat lovingly, forgivingly, as if she can't resist him.
CLAUDIA

It's beautiful, Father. You're a
Prometheus. You've brought the
fire from heaven.
LESTAT
Yes, that's true, my dear.

Lestat breaks off, realizing this might be taken the
wrong way. But Claudia is smiling.

LOUIS
And we've a pair of new servants.
Lestat's found a mother and
daughter, excellent maids.
LESTAT
Yes, I'm tired of all this dust,
and strange charwomen coming and
going.
LOUIS
They think us most peculiar, of
course, but they will clean by
day, and take their wages from the
hall table, and be out of the way
before we rise.
Claudia laughs at the irony of it.
She sits at the piano, looking around at all the gas
light, even the gas sconce that lights her music, and she
begins to play a somber piece by Beethoven, become ever
more morose and involved.
Lestat and Louis exchange glances, amazed at her absorbtion and her skill. She doesn't notice. She continues
to look dreamily at the light.
CUT TO:

Paintings have changed, and some furniture.
Louis watches Lestat go through a pile of books on the

Aurelius. What's the matter with
Dickens or Thackery or Wilkie

LOUIS
Yes, and she reads her books

Louis and Lestat realize that Claudia has appeared in the

Then turns back to Lestat approaching him.
CLAUDIA
One of you had to do it. You

She hurls the chrysanthemums at Lestat's feet.
CLAUDIA
Monstrous parents! To give me
immortality in this helpless
guise, this hopeless shape.
Lestat is angry.

EXT. OLD PART OF CITY - OLD PITCHED ROOF OF FRENCH
HOUSES - MUD STREET
Louis talks with Claudia as they walk slowly, finally
coming to a halt beneath a dim gaslamp.
ECHO of Claudia's CRYING of years before.
LOUIS
It was the old days, there, there
is the house, or perhaps it's that
one. I can't tell. The plague
was raging in the city. I heard
you crying. You were there in a
room with your mother, and she'd
been dead for days. You didn't
know it. You clung to her. You
begged me to help you. I came
into the room. I felt pity for
you. Pity... but something else.
CLAUDIA
You fed on me! I was your victim!
LOUIS
Yes! I did it! But you had a
heart like no other heart I'd
ever felt. It wouldn't stop.
Then Lestat came. He found me
out. He laughed at me, Louis the
sentimental one, with a holy
innocent in his arms. I ran from
him, from you.
CLAUDIA
You meant to kill me!

You left

LOUIS
Yes. The next night, he found
you in the hospital where they'd
taken you.

LOUIS (CONT'D)
I never knew what he meant to do
but teach me my nature. 'Finish
it,' he said.
Claudia backs away.

He grabs her wrist.

LOUIS
Oh, I know I've lost you. You
look at me now as you look at
mortals, from some cold selfsufficiency I can't understand.
But the hunger, that we all
understand! I felt it for you
then, a vile unsupportable hunger,
a hunger for your hammering heart.
For this cheek, this hair.
Claudia lets him touch her.
LOUIS
You were pink and soft as mortal
children are, sweet with the bite
of salt and dust.
Claudia's face softens only a little.
LOUIS
I held you again. I took you.
And when I thought your heart
would drag me down with it and
I didn't care, he parted us. He
cut his wrist. He gave you the
blood to drink. And drink you
did. And you became one of us
that night. And drank blood
from your first victim. And you
have drunk the blood of mortals
every night ever since.
He waits.

Claudia looks at him, unreadable.

It was I who took your life.

INT. PARLOR OF FLAT - SUNRISE
Stillness reigns over all.
Quadroon maid and teenaged daughter arrive. Both wear red
tignons or scarves, and gold earrings. The maid picks up
all the withered chrysanthemums, clucking over the mess.
The teenaged daughter begins to sweep. Return to:
MALLOY AND LOUIS (SAN FRANCISCO) - PRESENT
Order of opened tapes on the table indicates the tape has
been changed, if anyone cares.
MALLOY
Did you lose her? Did she leave
you?
LOUIS
How could she? Little boy.
Little girl. She was a child
no bigger than that. What
would her life have been? And
something in her was kin to me,
kin to Lestat. We had each
other. We had endured for half
a century in harmony. We could
not bear to be alone.
INT. FLAT (1860)
Claudia at her dresser, dressed as a little girl,
brushes her long hair. Louis stands behind her. Then
drops down beside her, takes the brush and brushes
her hair for her.
She watches him through the mirror.
CLAUDIA
Locked together in hatred, that's
what we are.
LOUIS
No. You feel that now. But it's
love that binds us. Love is the
only thing that allows us to go

You think so?
I know so.

Lestat's voice SINGING a Verdi aria as he comes in.
Lestat enters.

Looks about.

LESTAT
Well, I see the maids are doing
their usual fine job.
LOUIS
I raised their wages as you
suggested. They're happy. This
evening, I saw them as they were
leaving. I told them how very
much we appreciated their work.
LESTAT
Yes, Jeannette the daughter has
grown so pretty.
CLOSE ON CLAUDIA'S STILL FACE
LESTAT
And do pay them more. That's one
thing I've noticed about even the
most superstitious mortals. Pay
them enough and they question not
a single thing.
Louis smiles.
LOUIS
I think you're right. They're
happy. And so are we.
Lestat snaps his fingers and points to Claudia.
LESTAT
Uptown, in the Rue Camp, a haunted
house! Ghost appeared three times
this very week. Want to go see
it.
Inspite of herself, Claudia smiles, sadly, wisely. She
rises and goes to his waiting arms. She is womanly,
cool, but pleasant.

CLAUDIA
But we aren't going to merely
watch, are we? Maybe we should
... you know... make a little
supernatural mischief ourselves,
don't you think? Louis, want to
come?
LOUIS
I wouldn't dream of spoiling your
evening.
INT. FLAT - PARLOR - EARLY EVENING
Lestat is reading a newspaper -- Mercurie De France -which he then throws into the fire.
Claudia enters, dressed in velvet, with muff and bonnet,
to go out. Bad mood.
CLAUDIA
Another newspaper from Paris?
Lestat turns round, stares at her.

Tension.

CLAUDIA
Why don't you ever save them?
LESTAT
Have you been searching my room?
CLAUDIA
Wouldn't do any good, would it?
She approaches the grate, confirms the paper is now
ashes.
CLAUDIA
You have no keepsakes, do you?
Only a wardrobe worthy of Czar of
Russia or the King of France.
LESTAT
Stay out of my room!
She looks up at him coldly.
Lestat is confused.
LESTAT
You look very beautiful tonight.
I love you in red.

CLAUDIA
I know. There are many vampires
in Paris, aren't there. Many of
us in the old world.
LESTAT
You'd despise them. We're the
only vampires on this earth who
matter! And New Orleans is ours.
We've never had to share it with
anyone.
He tries to laugh.
CLAUDIA
Perhaps it's time I saw Paris.
LESTAT
Perhaps so. Though frankly, I'd
prefer New York or maybe London...
CLAUDIA
You'd let us go to Paris, me and
Louis?
LESTAT
Oh, I see, so that's how it is.
I won't stop you, but you'd be a
fool if you didn't take me with
you.
Why?

CLAUDIA
LESTAT
Louis can't protect you as well
as I can. And our kind can be
your worst enemy.
CLAUDIA
Are there others like me there?
Little ones.
Lestat is overcome with emotion.
He whispers.

He shakes his head.

LESTAT
Claudia, you would have died if I
hadn't done it. I didn't
understand what I was doing. It
was an impulse.

CLAUDIA
I know. Poor darling. Poor
darling, Lestat, the thoughtless
one. And you'd protect me from
all the big bad vampires in Paris,
wouldn't you?
LESTAT
Yes, I would. You think they
don't war with one another, that
they don't try to destroy one
another? Remember the fire, my
child, and the light of the sun.
And there are other ways as well.
They won't share the City of Light
with a vagabond.
CLAUDIA
You're serious, aren't you?
You're telling me the truth.
LESTAT
Darling, I've never lied to you.
I've teased you, taunted you,
shouted at you, kissed you, even
struck you. But I've never lied.

Still sluggish and weak, she sits up slowly with no help

Standing against the new iron fence before the Cathedral,

hat and gloves and opera cape looks down at her.
CLAUDIA
If he made the journey we can make

from the elder passengers. We
can do it if he did it.

But why must we go without him?
It's time we all went traveling

He can't come with us.

Why not? I think he's ready for

He'll be in hell when we leave

Claudia turns and walks away impatiently.

Louis follows.

are lots of ways. He's told me.

He do can things neither of us

Yes, and do you think that

Because I do not hate him.

Why don't you hate him?
Louis shakes his head.
LOUIS
It's not as easy as that, my dear.
and I will not let you harm him.
Maybe we should go away for a
while, travel on our own, see if
we can manage.
CLAUDIA
Oh, we'll manage. Don't seek to
know the week or the night, or
the hour. And don't seek to come

LOUIS
You'll destroy me too?

Claudia is shaken.
CLAUDIA
No. I would never harm you. But
if you do seek to interfere...
Yes?

CLAUDIA
You'll never see me again.
She leaves so fast she seems to vanish.
INT. FLAT - ANOTHER NIGHT
Lestat marches through the place, seeing mess everywhere,
a theatre program on the carpet, a newspaper lying on the
settee. The window is open and the rain is coming in.

LESTAT
Mon Dieu, where is Jeanette?
Where's Marie? They haven't been
here for days!
LOUIS
Maybe we've frightened them some
way. I'd better call at their
house when I go out.
LESTAT
Jeanette would have come to me
herself if she were troubled.
She's never suspected a thing.
Lestat stops.

He lifts his chin.

What is it?

He catches a scent.

LOUIS
LESTAT
Damn her into hell. She's done
this!
LOUIS
What? What are you talking about?
Lestat, wait.
Lestat goes DOWN the hall, OUT on the porch, DOWN the
back stairs, ACROSS the courtyard, and INTO old deserted...
BRICK KITCHEN
As he rips open the wooden doors, a huge swarm of
gnats rises and nearly suffocates him. He waves them
away in disgust.
Louis looks over his shoulder.
They both see Jeanette and her daughter, Marie, freshly
dead in each other's arms, yet already devoured by heat
and insects.
Lestat bangs the shutters closed.
LESTAT
How dare she! Our own servants!
Mortals under my protection, and
to kill here, in our lair, and
leave the remains!

LOUIS
I'll talk to her. I'll reason
with her. She's full of
resentments. Now, come, help me
get rid of these two. I can't
bear to be near them.
Lestat shudders.

Opens kitchen doors again.

LESTAT
Damn her. Only the mad ones are
too lazy to clear away the
remains! She knows this is
forbidden.
He opens the old, unused iron-doored brick oven, and
turns and stares at the two bodies, disgusted that he
must touch them. He reaches down and touches Jeanette's
dark hair.

Louis is playing solitaire at a small game table.

LESTAT
She's back. What a surprise. I

gypsies. And she's got two
mortals with her.
Seems so.

LOUIS
I don't like it either.

LESTAT
How dare she bring them here!
LOUIS
Patience, mon ami. She wants an
independence that she can never
have. Let it go... for my sake
and your sake.
Lestat is too disgruntled.
Sounds of Claudia CLOSING DOOR at the end of the passage
and coming down the hall. She is a vision in lovely
white lace, pink ribbons, long hair.
CLAUDIA
Bonsoir, mon pere!
She beams at Lestat who sits down at the piano with his
back to the keys.
LESTAT
Ah, the prodigal daughter! I'd
given you up nights ago, after
you left those two murdered in
the kitchen. Where have you been.
CLAUDIA
Oh, little people can hide in
little places. And how considerate
of you to burn those bodies. Ashes
to ashes. My thanks.
He gets angry, but she gestures for patience. She
approaches him, smiling, radiant, seductive. She puts
her little hands on his shoulders.

brunette -- lie tumbled on the couch, heavily painted,
full breasts, gorgeous, very flashy and tacky and fast
asleep.

LOUIS
Don't take this victim here,
Lestat. Claudia, I want none
of this!
LESTAT
Don't fuss, Louis. I'll burn
the remains myself.
She draws near to Lestat who is bending over the brunette.

CLAUDIA
Go to it, let me watch you.
Lestat lifts the brunette, who groans and he sinks his
teeth into the flesh above her breast and drinks, giving
off long savoring moans as he does so. They look like
lovers.
Claudia watches.
Louis turns angrily to return to the parlor, then hears:
LESTAT
Hmmm, absinthe...
CLAUDIA
You've always liked the taste of
it, Father.
Louis comes back. Lestat continues to drink. Then
glaze-eyed, he pulls himself up and reaches for the
Blonde. He takes her ravenously, like someone kissing
farewell before a war.
He moans again, and she slips out of his arms and back
on the couch onto the body of the other one. He stares
forward...
Absinthe!

LESTAT
Almost paralyzed, he stares wildly as he slips to a
sitting position on the floor. With effort he focuses
on Claudia who comes toward him on tiptoe, and then bends
over him.

That's right, Father, and laudanum,

Claudia slips a huge knife out from under the pillows
beneath the whores. She drives it right through his
heart.
CLAUDIA
I'll put you in your coffin,
Father. I'll put you there
forever!

Louis rushes to stop her, as Claudia stabs Lestat over
and over in an orgy of wounds, blood pouring out of him.
Louis reaches her just as she has slashed Lestat's
throat, and he grabs for the knife, lifting it, and her
with it because she will not let go of it.
LESTAT
My God, Louis... it's too many
wounds! Too fast!
Claudia kicks at Louis heaving him backwards over the
table, BOTTLES CRASHING as he falls. As he climbs to
his feet, she pounces upon Lestat and sinks her fangs
into his neck and sucks his blood ravenously.
Louis rushes to Lestat just as Claudia draws away,
repelled and stunned by what is happening to Lestat:
Lestat is shriveling, as if he'd been a bag of blood.
His skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment,
his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face. A
noise escapes his lips. His lush, beautiful hair remains
unchanged. But his clothes are virtually being emptied
of the body.
It is now no more than the bones, wrapped in paper and
the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered
skull.
Claudia stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping, which looks totally dead. She is fascinated.
Louis kneels beside the ghastly spectacle.
He reaches for Lestat's shoulders. But it's just bones,
held together with cloth, or so it seems, and Louis drops
the skeleton in fear and horror. It lies in the puddle of
blood. The eyeballs, blank, now look yellow. All the
skin looks yellow.
Claudia pulls herself out of her thrall.
Tenderly, she approaches Louis, patting his shoulder in
a reassuring way.
CLAUDIA
Go now, go on. It's my doing and
I shall finish it.
No!

LOUIS

CLAUDIA
He's dead, Louis! Spare yourself
the sight of the flames.
Louis begins to gather up the dried limbs though they
flop free like sticks.
LOUIS
Not in that filthy oven, not with
those charred bones. Not like
that, no.

EXT. OLD CEMETERY NEAR POINTE DUE LAC - NIGHT
A carriage stands on the distant road with its lamps
burning.
Louis, carrying the white wrapped body of Lestat wanders
among the old tombs.
LESTAT (V.O.)
I loathe places like this, damn
it!
CLAUDIA (V.O.)
Then leave, Father. Nobody said
you had to be properly buried.
Louis, in grief and confusion, leaves the cemetery.
Goes into:

INT. FLAT
Claudia comes behind him, distressed and perplexed.
CLAUDIA
Don't you see, we're free now? We
can go. What's wrong with you?
Louis, look at me. Louis, he
deserved to die.
Louis turns around in the doorway of his room:

LOUIS
Then so do we! Every night of our
lives. We should die, both of us,
now. He was my brother! My
maker! He gave me eternal life.
CLAUDIA
I told you I meant to do it.
LOUIS
Yes, you did! And I didn't dare
warn him because I didn't believe
you could do it! And I was
afraid that if I did warn him,
that if he believed me, he'd
destroy you!
CLAUDIA
(hurt)
Please, Louis... He wronged us
both when he made us. He kept
us under his dominance always...
LOUIS
Leave me alone. I can't look at
you. I'll care for you because
you can't care for yourself. But
I don't want you near me. Get
away.
Claudia's eyes are glazing over with faint bloody tears.
She turns away.
Louis walks into his room, stares blindly around him.
Then he's distracted by:
Claudia's CRYING. A terrible heartbroken crying, like
the crying he heard the first night he ever saw her,
utterly defenseless, but it's ECHOING like a vampire's
crying.
He can't quite believe his ears. He moves into the hallway and then into her room. She lies against a heap of
pillows on the bed, truly sobbing. He draws near,
touches her shoulder and when she looks up at him, her
eyes and face are stained with blood tears. The blood
runs down her cheeks. Her lips tremble. She sobs
uncontrollably, lips trembling.

CLAUDIA
Louis, I did it for us. So we
could be free. I did it because
of what he did to us. I tried
to forgive him. I couldn't do
it. Louis, if I lose you... I
have nothing. I would undo it
to please you. I would, I swear
it...
He shushes her gently, gathering her into his arms and
sits on the bed covering her hair and her blood-stained
face with kisses. She cries softly, allowing herself to
be comforted.
LOUIS
Very well, my darling.
my love...

Very well,

Claudia crying softly against his blood-stained shirt.
CLAUDIA
We'll leave here, Louis. We'll go
to Paris. We'll forget he ever
existed. We'll find others.
We'll see the world. Who knows
what the old ones know? What they
can do.
LOUIS
All right, my darling.

hears...

CANARIES SINGING in Claudia's room.

LOUIS
Ah, the birds. I forgot the

but let them go.

Claudia, weary, melancholy sits down on the sofa as he

CLAUDIA
She turns in panic to the front of the flat. STEPS
CONTINUE UP the STAIRS. ON the PORCH. The DOOR CRASHES
open.
Lestat in filthy swamp-soaked rags nearly falls into the
hall. He is robust again, but his entire body is covered
with creases where the flesh had wrinkled and shriveled.
He is scored all over with these scars. His eyes are
bloodshot. He can hardly steady himself.
Louis tries to stop him, but Lestat contemptuously and
clumsily throws Louis to one side.
CLOSEUP OF LESTAT'S
scarred face, seemingly without reason.
Claudia!

LESTAT

BACK TO SCENE
Claudia rushes into the parlor, but he's after her. She
snatches up the poker from the fireplace and batters him
with it fiercely, knocking him backward. He staggers.
Louis comes in and throws his arms around Lestat's
shoudlers. Lestat hurls him back and off balance again
and then kicks him a powerful kick in the gut. Claudia
screams.
Lestat snatches the poker from Claudia and reaches for
her. She shoves him with all her might and he falls
back against the gas sconce, SHATTERING the GLASS. The
fire burns his face. He cries out.

Claudia regains the poker and whips the burning coals out
of the grate at Lestat's feet. They land on the carpet
and near the draped furniture and begin to smolder.
Sheet over chair begins to burn. Lestat stares down at
the smoking coals trying to get his bearings. Claudia
slams him with the poker again in the GAS flame, and this
time the SCONCE SHATTERS and the flame EXPLODES up the
wall.
Louis struggles to his feet. The wallpaper is burning.
Lestat's hair catches. She turns, sees the burning sheet
on the chair and hurls it at Lestat. Her dress catches.
She screams.
The room is exploding into flame.
Lestat is on his knees, choking, hands up over his face,
in the smoke. Louis grabs up Claudia smothering the
flames of her skirt with his hands. The whole parlor is
afire.
Louis carries her out, down the back stairs, through
carriage way and through the gathering crowd of mortals
and away down the...
STREET
Finally, he stops and sees that she is not badly burnt,
only terrified. She clings to him. He looks back at the
glare of the distant burning house.
He puts Claudia down in a doorway.

Stay here, until I come back.

Louis runs back toward the townhouse. It is surrounded
by mortals. Fire roars out of the parlor window. Louis
walks closer, cleaving to the wall, trying not to rouse
notice. He looks up. The parlor is an inferno.
Claudia catches up with him.

Desperate.

CLAUDIA
The tide's going out!

Picking her up, Louis hurries away.
EXT. DECK OF SHIP
Louis stands at the railing in the morning mist as the
ship moves down river. He sees...
CITY OF NEW ORLEANS
with its flickering lights.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Until the very dawn I stood on
that deck, watching, fearful he
would come again, out of the very
river like some monster to destroy
us both. And all the while I
thought Lestat, we deserve your
vengeance. I deserve it. You
gave me the Dark Gift. And I have
delivered you into the hands of
death for a second time.

LOUIS
Oh, yes, he could have. He
couldn't come after us, no, he
was too weak for that. But he

MALLOY
Was she right? Did he die in the
fire?
LOUIS
(smiling sadly)
How could we know? You can
imagine how powerful he was to
rise from the swamp as he had...
MALLOY
He was conscious all the while,
waiting to get his hands on
something living, something with
blood in it...
LOUIS
Exactly. It isn't very hard to
envision. There must have been
blood filled creatures all around
him in those waters. And he was
Lestat after all. Maybe he fed on
the smallest at first, and then the
great alligators of the wilderness
until he was healed enough to take
some hapless human on the road.

LOUIS (V.O.)
I think I did pray that he escaped

Meanwhile, each night brought us
closer to Europe, closer to Paris,
closer to a world of which we had
only dreamed.

Crowds and gaslight everywhere. Carriages, horses.
OPERA coming from the opera house.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Ah, Paris. How many mortals have
uttered that name with reverence.
Is there any other place that
evokes such love? But understand
what Paris meant to us... we two
had lived a century in New
Orleans. Paris was a universe,
whole and entire unto herself!
EXT. 18TH CENTURY PALACES ALONG THE SEINE - NIGHT
The high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in
pairs through the shadowy tulieries.
EXT. STREET - SHOP WINDOW
Claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through the
glass at the dolls. They resemble her markedly, these,
with blonde hair and blue eyes. She peers deep into the
shop to see:
MADELINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting a
doll's face, oblivious to being watched. Claudia smiles
at her lovingly. Then looks with a troubled expression
at the dolls.
INT. OPERA STAIRCASE
Louis and Claudia hurrying hand and hand with crowd of
mortals as we hear the sound of the ORCHESTRA TUNING
beyond. Both are excited and happy.

INT. NOTRE DAME
Claudia and Louis standing in the deep shadows of Notre
Dame, looking up at the branching arches. Louis is overcome with the beauty. He is excited. Claudia is
fascinated.
INT. GALLERY
Louis and Claudia walk among paintings of 1870 with other
spectators. Louis studies them intently. He studies
the mortal ladies passing, studies their big fashionable
hats.

teases him about not liking his wine. She smiles to
herself thoughtfully.

at the open French windows listens to sounds of the CROWD
outside. Busy night.
Louis approaches, drops on one knee and presents her with
a little string of pearls. He puts them on her, gazing
at her slightly uneasily and then he kisses her on both
cheeks.
She forces a smile.

CLAUDIA
Where are the others, Louis? I
can hear them. I can sense their
presence. But they hide.
LOUIS
Let's not be so eager to find
them, my fairy princess. Lestat
warned me often enough about them.
They may not be willing to share
their territory, even with two
such human creatures as you and I.
CLAUDIA
But they're like us! They are
what we are!
LOUIS
Are we so alike, Claudia?
Claudia smiles at him, kisses him.
CLAUDIA
Alike enough, don't you think?

Yes.

LOUIS

She looks out at the crowds below.

Maybe they know things.
She looks at her hands, her own reflection in the open
French door beside her.

Charms for what, my dear?

they had some precious secret.
You know what they'll be like.

ridiculous rustics.

Louis admires her. She watches carriages stop below.
Porters rush to gather luggage. Ring of LADY'S LAUGHTER.

Sometimes it's almost worse here.

Louis controls his inner thoughts.

He says only.

LOUIS

And

He takes her hand. She gives in. As they open the door
to the hall to leave, sound of ORCHESTRA SWELLS from
lobby below.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - ANOTHER NIGHT
Louis wakes up from a nap, rumpled on the lavish bed,
picks up his book -- David Copperfield -- and tries to
find his place. He is wearing distinct clothing -- a
green frock coat and striped waistcoat, cream-colored
pants. Claudia enters, shuts the door.
She has a large parcel. She strips off bonnet and gloves
and then tears loose the ribbon from the box.
She lifts a huge doll from the box, a duplicate of
herself.
LOUIS
Wherever did you find that?
CLAUDIA
You thought I hated dolls now,
didn't you?
LOUIS
Yes, I did. But that one looks
exactly like you.
Claudia flings the doll gently in the chair. She strips
off her own cape. Her hair is loose. Her manner and
expression are entirely womanly.
CLAUDIA
It should. It was made for me, by
the doll maker, Madeleine. I asked
her to make it. All her dolls
resemble me.
Claudia tosses her hair, scowls at the doll and picks it
up and begins fussing with it. Suddenly something snaps
in her expression.

CLOSE ON HER FACE
as she looks down at the doll. She blinks as we hear the
GLASS BREAK. She flings the doll onto the empty hearth
where its broken head is utterly shattered.
Louis studies her sadly, but not with complete sympathy.
He looks at the broken doll. He holds his tongue.
Claudia runs her fingers back through her own hair in a
woman-like gesture, her face ironic and grim. Louis
deliberately looks away.
CLAUDIA
Why do you look away, why don't
you look at me?
Louis puts down the book on the table, rises, brushes off
his coat and straightens his coat. He lifts a dark green
wool cape from over the arm of a chair and puts it over
his shoulders.
LOUIS
Your tone is unkind with me
again, tonight. It seems your
habit of late. Maybe I should go
walking and leave you to your
meditations for a while.
Claudia approaches, face molded in a sophisticated expression of ironic dissatisfaction.
CLAUDIA'S POV - LOOKING UP AT LOUIS
CLAUDIA (O.S.)
Ah, but tell me something from
that lofty height, before you go.
BACK TO SCENE
Louis nods, he sits down on the bed beside her and he
bends to take her hand and kiss it.
CLAUDIA
What was it like... making love?
Louis is stunned. He blushes. He rises and goes to the
door. He reaches for the knob.
CLAUDIA
You don't remember? Or you never
knew.
She stares at him coldly, mocking him. He turns around,
leans against the door. He answers candidly.

LOUIS
It was something hurried. Seldom
savored. Quickly lost. I think
that it was... the pale shadow of
killing.
They look at each other.
CLAUDIA
(in pain)
Ahhh. Like hurting you as I do
now... that is also the pale
shadow of killing.
LOUIS
Yes, madame. I am inclined to
believe that is correct. Bonsoir.
He goes out and closes the door.
EXT. WINDING STREET (LATIN QUARTER)
LOUIS (V.O.)
I knew her dissatisfaction was
growing. Her resentments were
increasing night after night.
Though she'd claimed to hate
Lestat, now she missed him, and
her anger was turning slowly on
me.
Louis walks briskly, inspecting the old buildings about
him, enchanted with them, yet worried about Claudia.
Suddenly he stops. Listens. He takes a step. He hears
a STEP behind him. He takes two steps. He hears TWO
STEPS. He takes three, four, five and the STEPS MIMIC
his. He senses danger.
He stares ahead at the light of a lone gaslamp at the top
of the hill and then a figure materializes there under
the gaslight, or appears to do so.
SANTIAGO, a tall vampire stares down at him. And gradually we realize as does Louis that this vampire has
assumed the same attitude and posture as Louis and that
his clothes are identical to Louis's and his black hair is
combed in the same way.
Louis gives a little involuntary shake of the head.
Santiago mimics. Louis takes a step forward. Santiago
mimics. Louis utters a syllable and so does Santiago.
Louis falls silent and folds his arms. So does Santiago.
The timing is preternatural.

LOUIS AND SANTIAGO
(simultaneously)
Clever.
LOUIS
You mean me harm?
SANTIAGO
(a beat behind)
You mean me harm?
Louis calculates.
Trickster.

LOUIS
Buffoon!

Santiago echoes the first word but not the second. Louis
has broken his composure. He turns his back on Santiago
only to come face to face with Santiago right in front of
him.
Again Louis turns his back to find Santiago facing him.
Louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.
LOUIS
I've been searching for you. I've
come to find you and this is what
I find?
Slowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the
mirror tricks and suddenly pushes Louis who is slammed
back against the wall. Santiago smiles.
Louis is furious. He quickly regains his balance and he
deals Santiago a great blow, catching him just as he
tries to dodge. Santiago staggers, is amazed and as
Santiago rushes at him, Louis deals him a strong blow
again.

Then Louis sees
Armand, standing alone with his back to the light.
Armand's hair is trimmed short nineteenth-century style,
like Louis's and he is dressed for the period in a black
frock coat, and high-collared white silk shirt. He looks
like an angel.

BACK TO SCENE
Armand!

LOUIS
Armand looks momentarily confused, then regains his calm,
tranquil expression.
ARMAND
Louis, is it not? Louis de Pointe
du Lac.
He cocks his head, scanning Louis's mind.
Louis becomes faintly suspicious.
Armand takes an engraved invitation out of his pocket and
thrusts it at Louis.
Louis reads aloud as we see:

ARMAND
Bring the petit beauty with you.
No one will harm you. I won't
allow it. But you must explain

Armand vanishes.
Louis listens to the silence.

Louis formally dressed, with Claudia in rich attire, in
his arms, approaches the theatre as others buy tickets
and go in.

Stage; curtain rises.
A vampire disguised as an old woman comes out on the
stage, limping to COMIC MUSIC, basket on her arm, as the
grim reaper, a vampire, holding a skull mask on a stick
before his face, follows her.
Suddenly she sees him. MUSIC is poignant. She kneels,
prays to him silently to take her. She lays her head
against her folded hands in weariness.
The grim reaper comes for a closer look, then backs off.
Laughter. The old woman rises and chases the grim reaper.
Laughter as they run round and round on the stage.
The grim reaper hides behind a painted tree. The old
woman gives up, goes away. Grim reaper now lowers the
mask and yawns. Revealing that he is Santiago. Bored,
he lifts the mask again, appears to fall asleep with it
over his face, against the painted tree.

Vampire men and women, clothed in black emerge from the

Suddenly, the Mortal Woman sees them and is more

aged 20 or 30 in mortal appearance.

Houselights go up as Louis sees Santiago standing in the
door of the box gesturing for them to come.
INT. FOOT OF STAIRWAY
opening into a
HUGE UNDERGROUND BALLROOM
Walls are painted with copies of famous Brueghels, Goyas,
depictions of death. Fine wooden coffins lie in niches
set into the walls up and down both sides of the long
room. Some are very old, some lustrous, some rusted.
Candles burn in sconces.
Armand stands in the center of the ballroom, hands
clasped behind his back, as Claudia and Louis come down
the stairs and into the room.
Vampire men and women seem to appear all around Louis and
Claudia deliberately startling them. Hands dart out to
touch Claudia as if she were a doll. Shrieks of preternatural laughter. She cleaves to Louis. He is silently
enraged. He looks to Armand.
Armand gestures for the vampires to back off.
All obey but ESTELLE.
ESTELLE
Such a darling. Whoever made you,
my dear?
She menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs
bared.

Armand glares at her. Suddenly she is forced off her
feet and back against the wall by something invisible.
She slams into the plaster and glowers at Armand.
ESTELLE
That was crude of you!
She vanishes.
Blur. Armand reappears with a lighted candle in his hand.
He gestures for Louis to follow him. Claudia remains
behind, watching warily.
Armand and Louis walk along the walls, the candle flaring
on the ghastly murals: The Triumph Of Death; The Fall Of
The Angels; Bosch's Hell.
Armand's face gleams like that of an angel above the
candle. Louis is horrified by the paintings as he was by
the performance.
Monstrous.

LOUIS
ARMAND
(lips not moving yet
echoing Claudia's
earlier words)
Yes, and very beautiful.
LOUIS
Your lips, they didn't move.
ARMAND
I'll speak in audible words if it
makes you happy. I can do it
either way.
Louis looks at him, drawn to him, yet wary.
Armand snaps his fingers.
A mortal boy of fifteen comes forward. Armand gestures
to Louis. And the boy offers himself. Louis is utterly
confused. Can't resist. Sees marks on the boy's throat.
Drinks his blood.
Other vampires appear all around Louis who suddenly
senses it and draws back, releasing the boy, ashamed.

smiles as he withdraws, spellbound and weak.
LOUIS
glares at the others.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Armand beckons for Claudia and Louis to follow as he
reveals a door in the wall by opening it and leading them
down stairs into a passage and into a stone room with
medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a blazing fire.
Books on one wall.
MEDIEVAL PAINTING OF SATAN
hangs over the fire.
ON SCENE
A door is open to the rainy night outside and another
stairway to the street above. Armand closes it. Louis
falls into the chair, hands to his temples.
Armand turns to Claudia. Claudia's eyes mist. Without a
change of expression, she sits limp in a chair, her eyes
moving listelessly over the books.
CLOSE ON BOOKS
Withcraft, demonology, lives of the Saints, Grand
Grimoire.
BACK TO SCENE
She refuses to lose consciousness.
Armand sits in the chair opposite Louis as Louis looks up.
ARMAND
Disappointing, isn't it? To come
so far, and find so little! Jaded
lords and ladies of darkness
amusing themselves like the Old
Royal Court.

LOUIS
Yet, you are their leader! You
let them do all this. This play,
this horror...
ARMAND
You sound like your maker. It
was Lestat de Lioncourt, wasn't
it, who made you both? He
comdemned me once in the same
way. All I do is give the others
what they need of me.
LOUIS
And this theatre sustains them,
and gives them contentment.
ARMAND
So they let me believe. Or
perhaps I must believe it.
LOUIS
You can read my thoughts, can't
you?
ARMAND
Now and then. You don't know your
own strength. The child knows
hers. Her purpose she can't
conceal, but her deeper thoughts
are closed to all who would
pillage them.
LOUIS
She's no child. You know that
whether you can read her mind or
not. And what purpose do you
speak of?
ARMAND
She has the charm of a child. And
the wisest of us can be lulled by
appearances. And we need
interesting and new companions.
Do we?

LOUIS
ARMAND
You know we do. Time is our
enemy! What would we do without
the fledglings to guide us into
the new era as all we love slowly
rots and fades away?

Louis tears his eyes off Armand and looks up at the
picture of Satan.
ARMAND
Why do you stare at that?

But the old ones, the very old
ones...
Armand takes his hand.
ARMAND
I know nothing of God or the Devil.
I have never seen a vision, nor
heard a divine voice, nor learnt
a secret that would damn or save my
soul. And I am the eldest. For
all I know I am the oldest living
vampire in the world.
Louis is thunderstruck.
which is very sad.

He stares at the angelic face

CLOSE ON ARMAND.
Louis falls back into the chair.
Armand waits patiently.

Then:

ARMAND
This doesn't surprise you. You
knew you would find no answers
here.
LOUIS
Oh, but I hoped and I dreamed.
That Lestat was wrong, that there
was some framework, some place for
us. Children of Satan... that
someone somewhere knew why we were
allowed to exist.

ARMAND
Children of Satan? Didn't Lestat
tell you of those old customs.
Yes.

LOUIS
ARMAND
And if there is a Satan, who made
him, pray, whom do think?
LOUIS
Why, God made Satan.

Who else?

ARMAND
Then we're all Children of God,
aren't we? And that is what
mortals believe. How can we
improve upon that?
Louis is struck by the simplicity of it.
LOUIS
Then we are damned in hell, all
of us. We are evil...
ARMAND
But what is evil?
LOUIS
Now it's you who are deceiving
yourself. You know what it is.
You saw it on that stage tonight.
Evil is cruelty. Evil is murder.
Evil is the taking of a single
human life!
Armand is deeply moved by Louis' sincerity.
ARMAND
I fear for you!
LOUIS
And not for yourself?
(OPTIONAL.

SCENES OF VENICE WITH VOICE OVER)

ARMAND
No. I was born to Darkness
centuries ago, in Venice by a
Master who brought me to him in
love. He told me no tales of gods
or demons. It was the others who
told those lies.

ARMAND (CONT'D)
Those who came to destroy him
because he was an outlaw and a
blasphemer. Those who took me
away and taught me the Ways Of
Satan, and the Rules Of The
Children Of Darkness, the old
catechism of the damned.
CLOSE ON Louis's face.
ARMAND
And I took their vows, and said
their litanies, and sang their
hymns and danced at their sabbats.
Until Lestat came. Your maker.
The innocent one, the perfect
spirit of the last century,
believing in nothing but the
goodness of his own nature. And
he was right.
Louis doesn't answer.

Then:

LOUIS
Lestat knew we were evil.

ARMAND

Claudia appears suddenly at Louis's shoulder, interrupting. She is fighting a spell, as if it is a drug.
Trying to see and move with clarity.
CLAUDIA
Come, beloved. It's time we were
on our way. I'm hungry and the
streets wait.
She stares hard at Armand and he stares back at her.
She looks away warily, as if his eyes have a power.
ARMAND
You can leave by this door. The
others won't hurt you. I won't
let them. This I swear.

Armand looks meaningfully at Claudia who eyes him
suspiciously.
ARMAND
I have no magic potions for you,
little one. No charms.
Claudia is shocked by his words.
ARMAND
You will be as you are and as you
were made... a child forever.
Claudia is enraged and humiliated, glaring at him and
then at Louis.
CLAUDIA
I made no requests of you!
LOUIS
What are you saying to each other?
ARMAND
Go. Your finely appointed rooms
await you. You can always come to
this door if you wish to find me.
I'll be here.
INT. HOTEL SUITE (PARIS) - BEFORE DAWN
Claudia paces in a rage. Hair wild, dress undone,
looking entirely like a little woman, voice resonant
like a woman.
All childish innocence long lost.
CLAUDIA
I detest them, I can't stand the
sight of them! They disgust me!
Stupid, bourgeois Parisians.
Fools! They all dress in black,
did you see it? It's a damned
organization, a private club!
Louis stares into the fire, dejected.
CLAUDIA
God in heaven, what I wouldn't
give to speak with Lestat for
five minutes! And there are no
little ones among them. I am the
only one! The only one! And
their leader mocks me!

Louis takes her in his arms, tries to still her with
kisses.
CLAUDIA
What a fool I was to kill Lestat.
And I'm in danger.
What danger?

LOUIS
CLAUDIA
I can feel it emanating from all
of them! They want to know what
became of our maker. They're
suspicious. They have their rules.
Their idiotic rules!
LOUIS
They don't know what happened to
Lestat. They search our souls but
they don't have the answers. Not
yet. And we are in danger, my
cherie. We. Not you.
CLAUDIA
No, it is I who am in danger. And
as much from that ghastly Armand
as from the rest.
LOUIS
That's not true.
CLAUDIA
He wants you, Louis. He wants
you for a companion. He bides
his time in this place. 'How we
need new companions.' Do you
remember what he said? And he
taunts me with my foolish dreams!
LOUIS
What dreams, Claudia?
CLAUDIA
Did you think you were the only
fool, beloved? I dreamed of some
wizardry that would make me...
He kisses her, smooths back her hair.
LOUIS
You are perfect to me as you are.
You always were. You are my
beloved.

She leans on him, closes her eyes, confides:
CLAUDIA
Do you know what Armand's soul
said to me -- 'Why not end the
pain now, child? The sun can be
your deliverance.'
LOUIS
No.
CLAUDIA
Oh, yes. He can't make me grow
into a womanly shape but he can
show me how to die.
EXT. FOOT OF STEPS (PARIS) - NEXT NIGHT (RAIN)
by Armand's door.
Louis knocks.

Armand opens.

ARMAND
You've come early. I'm grateful
to you. I was waiting for you,
of course.
Listen to me.

LOUIS
He follows Armand into the room.
LOUIS
Claudia, she is dear to me, my...
daughter.
Your lover.

ARMAND
LOUIS
No, my beloved, my child.
ARMAND
If you say so. You are so
innocent.
LOUIS
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid.
She feels she's in danger from the
others.
She is.

ARMAND

LOUIS
But why? Why would they hurt
her. What right have they to do
anything to either of us!
ARMAND
They are the coven. They have
their laws. It's forbidden to
make one as young as she is, one
so helpless, one that cannot
survive on its own.
LOUIS
It wasn't her blunder!
ARMAND
She's too small to make a vampire
of a male or female old enough to
protect her. She can't... make
another at all. Do you know what
she hoped to find here?
LOUIS
Yes. She should have known such
a thing wasn't possible. But you
have to protect her.
Armand nods.
I know.

ARMAND
Louis sinks into the chair, looking up at Armand.
LOUIS
There was so much I wanted to
say to you, so much I wanted to
ask, to learn from you.
ARMAND
And I'm here to teach. I need
you, young one, just as you need
me. I'm the teacher Lestat
wouldn't be. And you're the
pupil he didn't want.
He draws close to Louis, a picture of boyish innocence.
ARMAND
How many vampires have the stamina
for immortality? Do you know
how quickly they perish of their
own will.

LOUIS
Yes, because I almost did it once
to myself.
ARMAND
No, you'd never give up on life.
I know you wouldn't. If the world
were reduced to one empty cell
and one fragile candle, you'd stay
in that cell studying that candle.
You see too clearly. You see too
much.
LOUIS
That's what Lestat said to me.
And I failed him! I wronged him.
Oh God.
ARMAND
(smiling)
How he must have loved you.
love you.
But why?

LOUIS
ARMAND
I need you more than he ever did.
To make my link with this century,
to carry me into its art and its
philosophy, and all the things I
despair of understanding on my own.
LOUIS
Oh, but you'd be making a terrible
mistake. I'm at odds with
everything and always have been.
I wasted life when I had it. I
waste my gifts now. I have never
belonged anywhere with anyone at
anytime.
Armand laughs softly.
ARMAND
You are so nearly perfect. Louis,
don't you realize everyone in this
Nineteenth Century feels as you
do? You are the very spirit of
these times! Your melancholy is
the melancholy of the century.
Louis is speechless, and in love.

ARMAND
There's so much I can show you. I
want to go back to Italy, back to
Venice, to the palace where I was
made. I can teach you things
about your powers you haven't
begun to learn. But listen. You
must... you must get the child
away from here. They won't
tolerate her. They'll destroy
her.
LOUIS
I can't leave her. Oh, I want to
come with you. Talking to you,
it's...
ARMAND
Like feasting? Like the deep rich
taste of blood?
Yes.

LOUIS
ARMAND
Come, I'll hold them off. They're
all cynical little cowards when
we get right down to it. The
trash of the era, just as you are
its essence. I'll keep them at
bay, but you must think of some
way to get her safely out of here
and on her own.
EXT. STREETS (MONTMARTRE)
Louis walks up the hill past lighted cottages.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Of course I couldn't leave her,
get her safely away! What did
such words mean to me. But I
wanted to leave her! For the
first time, I admitted it. I had
wanted to leave us since the
night she's tried to kill Lestat.
I loved her, yes, beyond reason,
but since that night, we had been
a torment to each other now and I
could deny it no longer.
Louis stops.

Peers into --

PAINTER'S STUDIO
The mortal painter is fast at work on a huge canvas,
vaguely impressionistic, very early Monet. He stops
in his work as he sees Louis in the doorway.
The painter wipes his hands on his smock, beckons for
Louis to enter. The room is brightly lighted, full of
glorious pictures. A fire blazes in the little stove.
Louis is hungry.

the painter who works furiously sketching Louis's face.
The painter stops, disturbed.
LOUIS

Save yourself. Beware.
The painter drops the brush, backs away in fear.
Louis takes him. The painter fights, but Louis sinks
his teeth and drinks.
Die.

LOUIS
Die... Give it up...

He releases the painter, still alive but comatose, onto
the floor.
Louis stares at the canvas, the sketch is a portrait of
innocence, a young man, wholly compassionate and gentle.
LOUIS
I'm mortal now, like you, my
brother, with your blood.
He touches his face.
Louis touches his own face.
LOUIS
Warm and wanting to be warmer, to
go on existing, and thriving on
your blood!
The painter's eyes close.

Louis lifts the painting and starts to leave with it,
when the painter opens his eyes, and rises up, grabbing
the painting from Louis.
They wrestle with it, Louis winning, but casting aside
the painting and drawing the painter up to him and
gashing his throat in rage for the final drink.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
Louis enters. He is carrying the painting sketch,
which he props on the mantel. Suddenly he catches a
scent. Small lift of his chin. He looks into the
mirror. He sees in the glass.
MADELINE, the Doll Maker, resplendent in green taffeta,
sitting like a Madonna with Claudia on her lap.
Claudia's arms are around her neck. The contrast between
mortal woman and immortal child is plain.
Louis turns around.

of wandering the world with your
new teacher. Well, you will make
her one of us before you leave me!
You will do that for all you've
done to me!
Louis recoils.
CLAUDIA
Do you know how I despise you?
Your evil is that you cannot be

didn't stop me when I destroyed
him. Well, you will do evil now
and for me!

Six more mortal years, seven,

EXT. HOTEL SUITE - BALCONY
Louis emerges from the room and puts his hands on the
railing. The wind blows the curtains. Behind him we
see...
Madeline dancing in mad circles with Claudia. Their
mingled laughter becomes louder and louder. Louis stares
down into the Boulevard. At the corner of...
CAFE DE LA PAIX
he sees...
Armand.

Watching him from the street.

HOTEL SUITE - NEXT NIGHT
Luggage being carted out by bellhops. Madeline is tracing
the flowers in the carpet with her foot like a person
on LSD, giggling, and dancing around the flowers.

Louis pays the last bellhop. He leaves. Claudia, dressed
and ready for the journey, shuts the door. She comes
back and she looks at Louis.
Forgive me.

CLAUDIA
LOUIS
There's nothing to forgive.

Madeline sobs in fear.

the fire more than from the early stabbing, is shoved
forward, teetering and reaching for Santiago's shoulder
to steady himself. He is clearly confused.

He stares, disoriented, at the others. Claudia looks at
him, but he does not seem to recognize her or anyone, but
Louis. Claudia is fearless and resigned.

You have no right to condemn us.
Lestat, look at me. Tell them to
let the other two go. I am the
one who hurt you. Tell them.
Lestat tries to follow, but can only express a faint
happiness at the sight of Louis. He tries to gather his
thoughts.
A BANGING, DRAGGING NOISE distracts Louis.
ESTELLE
Enough. The outcast has confessed.
The child is an abomination. The
woman is a weak and stupid
fledgling. The sentence on all
is death.
Louis goes wild, fighting, but they overpower him,
dragging him to a big iron coffin which they have
dragged to the spot. They force him down into it.
They lock a chain over his chest, and hold him.
Santiago bends over the coffin.

Louis turns round and round in rage. Passive still faces.
The open DOOR BANGS suddenly in gust of breeze and opens

Louis glares at it, at Lestat. Lestat's hands release

dress. Claudia's dress.

Louis sees it. He snatches it up and stares at it. The
DOOR BANGS AGAIN. Estelle laughs. RAIN GUSTS into the

Louis goes to the door. Armand approaches, tries to pull
him away, but Louis shrugs him off, advancing on the
doorway. He draws nearer and nearer and stares out -INT. BRICK AIRWELL
On the stones lie Claudia and Madeline, burnt to greasy
ashes, in each other's arms, exactly like the maid and
her daughter in the brick kitchen in New Orleans. Same
attitude, as if they died embracing each other.
Only Claudia's blonde hair and Madeline's red hair remain
unburnt.
Louis look at the walls of this airwell, he looks up many
stories to the sky.
Santiago shoves Louis suddenly into the ashes. Louis
roars in horror, then attacks Santiago, overpowering him,
ashes scattered into the RAINY WIND. Claudia's golden

Louis silently closes the door to the passage, and bars
it with the immense bar. He looks about. Looks at the
bar. It's enough to block this exit. He rushes back
out.

INT. THEATRE
Louis hurls kerosene all over the stage curtain, the
padded seats, the carpet. He leaves a long trail of
kerosene behind him like a wick. He rushes to the wings
and down the stairs, dribbling the kerosene behind him.
He sees the candlelight of the ballroom below. Then the
candle goes out. He listens, creeping quietly into the
ballroom, leaking the kerosene from the cask. He splashes
over the coffins that gleam in the dimness.
Then he strikes a match and heaves it at the kerosene.
Everything bursts into flames. The trail of kerosene
ROARS INTO FIRE through the ballroom over the coffins
and up the stairs. We hear EXPLOSION of FIRE above.
LOUIS
shudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. He
takes a small scythe from his belt and stands like the
Grim Reaper.
Estelle rises from her burning coffin, screams and tries
to run through the fire, but Louis slashes at her with the
scythe, and she goes down screaming, her dress in flames.

Louis backs to the stairs to the dungeon. He can see
down there a thin pale light under Armand's bolted door.

EXT. SIDEWALKS
there are hastily constructed wooden barriers, a fragment
of a wall, heaps of rubble, but the theatre is gone.
He climbs up over the heaps of rubble. A high wall
remains, a piece of burnt roof and rafters.
Carriages and pedestrians go by, ignoring him.
INT. CROWDED CAFE
across from the theatre. Louis sits at a table, paper
folded in front of him. We see headline:

LOUIS (V.O.)
The mortal world did not guess
what had taken place. Few bodies
had been found in the ruins.

LOUIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
In other words, the younger ones
had left their bones; the older
ones had been obliterated. No
mention of an eyewitness or a
survivor. How could there have
been?
INT. LOUVRE - NIGHTS LATER
It is already a museum by this time, and Louis fancily
dressed and composed, walks alone through the rooms,
looking at the painting by moonlight that comes through
the windows and the skylights. He pauses before a
Gericault. The Wreck of the Medusa.
Armand appears standing beside the painting.
Louis sighs.
LOUIS
You didn't even warn them, did
you?
No.
Why not?

I didn't want to.

You were their leader.

They

ARMAND
No. That was never true. The
theatre was mine. But I was
never the leader, not since the
time when Lestat destroyed the
old ways.
Louis stops.
LOUIS
And Lestat? Was he there when
the theatre burned?
ARMAND
Did you want him to be there?

Louis walks on.
LOUIS
I don't know. That's the truth
of it. I don't know.
ARMAND
You are much changed, and yet you
are the same.
Armand looks at him affectionately.
LOUIS
What a pair we are. We deserve
each other, don't we?
ARMAND
What does it matter, innocent one.
We are a pair! That is what counts.
Armand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre together.
LOUIS (V.O.)
That is the end of my story
really. I never changed after
that. I left Paris shortly after
and Armand followed me. For years
we wandered the world. Greece,
Egypt, all the ancient lands.
But Claudia's death is truly the
end of my tale.
RETURN TO:
EXT. DIVISADERO STREET - PRESENT
TRAFFIC ROARING along Divisadero Street below the window.
LOUIS (V.O.)
We were in Venice when Armand
went his own way. I feared for
him going off on his own, but not
enough to utter a single word to
stop him. From time to time, I
glimpsed others... old ones.
Sometimes they fled. Sometimes
they were indifferent.
EXT. OLD DELHI (INDIA) - PRESENT TIME
Crowds swarming in the early evening. Autos push against
the endless stream of motley pedestrians.

LOUIS (V.O.)
Then only a few years ago, I
caught a glimpse of another
vampire, and I knew at once it
had to be Gabrielle!
CLOSE ON Louis in gentleman's white tropical suit staring
through the crowd.
Distant figure of Gabrielle, her hair tied back, dressed
in khaki men's clothes, white-faced, oblivious, like a
walking statue. Unnoticed yet horrifying in her trancelike movement.

I didn't dare call out to her.
What could I have said to her?

He watches as she suddenly vanishes. He hurries through
the crowd trying to catch another sight of her, but he
can't. She seems to have disappeared. He's alone in the
mortal crowd.

Every memory of Lestat I'd ever
buried in my soul came back to me.
Oh, I'd never really forgotten
him, but now he crowded everything
from my mind. He became my
obsession.

He did

LOUIS
That's what I had to find out.
I'd been back to Paris innumerable
times. I would have known had he
been there. Now I wanted to
return to New Orleans. Finally
I could think of nothing else.
The idle dream that if he existed
still, he might be there. And I
wanted to see my home again. My
city. Where we had been so happy
all those years. It was a
reason... for existing.

EXT. GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT
Louis in Twentieth Century suit walks past the many Greek
Revival Mansions.
LOUIS
Maybe I sensed something in those
dark streets. I saw and heard
sounds. And then on Prytania
Street, only blocks from the
Lafayette Cemetery, I caught the
scent of death and it wasn't
coming from the graves.
PAN OVER white-walled Lafayette Cemetery, surrounding
mansions.
LOUIS (V.O.)
The scent grew stronger as I
walked on uptown. Old death. A
scent too faint for mortals to
detect.
Louis sees rats darting along the street. One, then two,
then two more together. They rush into a great overgrown
garden surrounding a ruined mansion. No lights.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Someone was luring them.
A cat darts along the top of the wall and into the
garden.
LOUIS (V.O.)
The smell of death grew stronger.
Louis stops at rusted gate.

of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. He sees a
faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glassless
window of a huge two-story Greek Revival house.
He approaches, and then he sees -HIS POV
Old shriveled corpse of a man, long dead and dried up,
snagged in the thorny rose vines.

BACK TO SCENE
He looks around. Walks on. Sees another corpse, almost
nothing but bones sinking into the wet earth, the roots
of the oak overgrowing it.
He looks up at the distant light.
He passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose
vine, only bones and clothes.
LOUIS (V.O.)
They were like the doomed princes
caught in the thorny vines of
Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew
what it meant. A vampire had
lured them here, but had been too
weak to get rid of them.
Louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.
LOUIS (V.O.)
No vampire can linger near the
remains of his victims. It spelt
despair -- the behavior of a dying
animal that pollutes its own nest.
Perhaps it meant madness.
Louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. He moves
along the porch. More dead rats. He sees through the
floor-length windows into rooms lined with stacked books.
Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down over the
books. It gleams as it drips from the ceiling. The
floors of the splendid rooms are bare, except for a
rotted French chair by a dead fireplace. A single mirror
reflecting the moon.
Dead rats.

HIS POV
Lestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near starvation. All his scars are gone, but he is almost a skeleton
and his eyes are enormous in their sockets. His clothes
are rags. Blond hair beautiful as always.
One tiny candle stands beside him.
The Black Mask Magazine.

He reads:

He reads aloud the second installment of Dashiel
Hammett's, The Maltese Falcon, laughing now and then, with
delight. He affects a tough American voice, lapsing into
French accent for narrative.
Without turning his head he speaks.
LESTAT
Come into my parlor, Louis, said
the spider to the fly.
He goes on reading, as Sam Spade bullies Joe Cairo.
INSIDE
Louis studies him.

Lestat ignores Louis.

LOUIS
I prayed you were alive!
Did you?

LESTAT
To whom did you pray?

Lestat continues reading.

He is Sam Spade.

Louis approaches and takes the magazine tentatively from
Lestat's hand. Lestat allows this.

But he

LESTAT
You are beautiful, Louis. You
always were. The strong one.
Armand's no longer with you, is
he? That's better for you, though
you may not know it now.
LOUIS
Where is the coffin?

LESTAT
What does it matter? There are
many dark places in my house and
beneath it.
LOUIS
Lestat, this place is a ruin.
This is no longer safe. Mortals
will come here.
Lestat laughs softly.
LESTAT
That would be lovely. I haven't
tasted mortal blood in so long.
Could you get me a mortal, Louis?
Lestat struggles to sit up. He is straightbacked, smiling, a horror of starved limbs.
LESTAT
You know, some nasty little thief
or killer, like in the old days.
Some bittersweet trash from the
riverfront. I can still hear the
river. I can smell it. Can you?
Don't bother. I don't really
want a human. If I did, I'd get
one for myself.
LOUIS
How long have you been here?
Lestat falls into thought, then suddenly excited:
LESTAT
Louis, last time I went out I saw
the most marvelous thing.
LOUIS
(compassionately)
What was it?
LESTAT
A motion picture, Louis. People
moving on a giant screen. Oh, it
was magic. And there was
dialogue, written on cards in
between the moving pictures. It
was a whole story. Orphans In
The Storm. Lillian Gish. It was
beautiful. Surely you've seen
it. You look so fit, so well.

Lestat's face darkens.
What is it?

LOUIS
LESTAT
They showed the daytime sky! I
was frightened. I left the
theatre. I ran all the way back
here. Do they still make these
motion pictures? I know all about
radios, I can hear them, I love
them, and some sort of... I don't
know what it is...
LOUIS
Lestat, they make motion pictures
in color. The actors speak. The
daytime sky in a film can't hurt
us. The rising sun in a film is
just an illusion.
Loud noise from the street of TRUCK RATTLING BY.

crosses his legs Indian-style and bends over.

He

LOUIS
Lestat, it's only a truck passing.
Lestat takes his hands away from his ears.
OTHER SOUNDS of the night. DISTANT TRAFFIC. A SIREN.
Lestat winces at the siren, but it DIES AWAY.
LESTAT
I know what these sounds are,
Louis. I saw the automobiles when
I went out last. I saw them
chugging and racing through the
street. Here... look!
He holds up the Black Mask magazine. Points to an advertisement of a young man riding a motorcycle. Year 1929.
LESTAT
Motorcycles, they pass sometimes.
Lestat shivers.
LESTAT
And there are aeroplanes... in the
sky.

A silence falls. Lestat's mind appears to wonder. He
looks about and then looks up at Louis in happy surprise.
LESTAT
You are here, I thought I was
dreaming! See the rats? In the
old days in France, they called
us country lords harecatchers -we starved if we didn't kill the
small game. And now I'm the rat
catcher!
(laughs)
The Pied Piper. And the rats,
they are marvelously reliable.
They never learn not to come when
I call.
Lestat laughs softly.
Louis smiles bitterly.
They look at each other.
LESTAT
I didn't go to Paris for vengeance,
Louis.
Louis says nothing.
LESTAT
I came for the blood of the old
ones. For Armand's help. I was
healing, but it was so painful and
so gradual, and I was still, well,
you know... young.
Louis says nothing.
LESTAT
I did tell them she'd tried to
kill me. You can't blame me for
that, can you?
No.

LOUIS
I can't blame you for it.

LESTAT
But it was Armand who directed the
whole trial and execution as if
it were the final play for his
little stage.

LOUIS
I suppose I've always known that
was so. And yet I stayed with
him.
LESTAT
Loneliness. You needn't tell me.
You should develop a taste for
rats again. You tried once,
didn't you? Sometimes I talk to
them before I kill them. I never
did that with innocent mortals.
Did I? I was never cruel to
mortals, was I?
Louis shakes his head.
LOUIS
You must come out of here.
Please. Come with me.
Lestat shakes his head.
Sudden sound of DIESEL TRAIN from the riverfront. PIERCING WHISTLES. Again, Lestat cowers, covering his ears.
He trembles violently. He shrinks up, knees under his
chin. The SOUND DIES AWAY.
A pause.
LESTAT
There are machines out there, that
cool the houses. In summer they
roar like wild beasts. But the
warmth is lovely then. I don't
mind it. Only I wish the trees
hadn't grown so thick. I can no
longer see the stars.
Louis drops down beside him.

Urgent.

LOUIS
Lestat, let me get you out of
here. Let me show you the world
the way it is now. It's full of
marvels. Of all of us, you should
see it, you above all should -Lestat smiles.
LESTAT
Should what? Respect it? Have
the stamina for eternity? A
passion for beauty that helps me
endure the passage of time?

Lestat laughs bitterly.
He gathers up the Black Mask magazine. He begins to read
again out loud -- Sam Spade and Joe Cairo. Tough guy
accent.
Louis stares at him.

He speaks his name, but can't get

He grabs Lestat and shakes him.
LESTAT
Back off, my friend! I may not be
as weak as you think.
He sits up again very straight, in full command.
LOUIS
That's the point! You've healed.
You're whole again. But you must
feed.
LESTAT
Go away, Louis.
LOUIS
You'll be destroyed if you stay
here. You'll be discovered. This
place... it could...
LESTAT
Burn? Like Pointe du Lac. Like
our townhouse? Like the Theatre
des Vampyres? Oh, and thank you
for that last conflagration. I
thought they deserved it.
Despicable liars. They never
helped me. They never gave me
their healing blood. And to think
Armand's blood was so powerful
with age. Do you know what he
really did?
EXT. TOP OF TOWER (PARIS) (1870)
Armand forcing the wounded, scarred Lestat to the
battlements.
LESTAT (V.O.)
He took me back to the Magnus's
tower, the very place where it
had all started. He lured me
there with his promises.

Armand strikes Lestat and sends him over the battlement.
He falls and falls until he is smashed on the stones.
Blood flows from his fallen body but his blue eyes are
wide open. He is alive.

You remind me of too many things.
He lies back down and opens the magazine.
LESTAT
You knew she meant to destroy me.
Yes, I did.

LOUIS
LESTAT
You left me in the burning
townhouse.
Yes, I did.

LOUIS
LESTAT
And when you burnt the Theatre,
for all you knew I was there.
LOUIS
Hate me for it. Come back to do
battle, to quarrel. Take your
vengeance!
Lestat laughs softly, shaking his head.
LOUIS
My blood isn't as powerful as
Armand's, but it can revive you.

LESTAT
No, thank you, my dark brother.
I remember that taste only too
well.
LOUIS
Lestat, don't you want to make
me suffer for what I've done to
you?
Lestat merely smiles at him, seeing through the taunt.
LESTAT
Louis, I think you are suffering
beautiflly, just as you have
always suffered. Why should I
lift a finger? It isn't
necessary.
Louis smiles ironically and nods in agreement.
LESTAT
Go away now, mon ami. Go back
to your modern world of marvels.
Let me have my peace and quiet.
And if you do come back, bring
something new to read. And
candles. Bring me candles. You
know how I love the light.
EXT./INT. RUINED MANSION - NEXT NIGHT
Louis comes up the steps and into the parlor. He has a
small parcel. Lestat reads as before. He does not look
up. Louis tears open the parcel, and removes a small
Watchman portable TV with earphones. He kneels by Lestat
and he turns it ON.
We see the tiny screen glimmer with a ROCK VIDEO, Madonna
dancing wildly.
Lestat sits up, clasps it, amazed.
LOUIS
This is to blot out all the sounds
that hurt you. Here.
He drops extra batteries on the floor and they gleam in
the light. He puts the earphones over Lestat's head.
Turns up the volume.
Lestat smiles in delight. He begins to laugh, and then
sway with the music which he can hear and which we can
not.

He holds the little Watchman like a treasure, singing in
perfect pitch the words of MADONNA'S song.
LESTAT
'Like a Virgin, kissed for the
very first time.'
INT. MANSION - HALLWAY - ANOTHER NIGHT
Louis stands in the doorway, arms folded.

He watches --

Lestat, a skeleton in rags, dancing as he wears the
earphones and holds the Watchman.
We hear a very THIN SOUND from the earphones: ROLLING
STONES. "I Can't Get No Satisfaction." Lestat dances
with eerie grace in perfect time.
MUSIC GROWS LOUDER.
As Louis watches, Lestat becomes the performer, singing,
dancing to the music, a spectacle among the ruins, as he
does the modern Michael Jackson-style move to perfection.
Louis tries to clear his vision, to shake the illusion
or suggestions of Lestat as rock star.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I don't remember how many times I
came back. Three? Four. It
doesn't matter. He would not look
at me or speak to me. And finally
one night he wasn't there.
EXT. MANSION
From a distance behind its jungle of vine and trees.
LOUIS (V.O.)
But I could hear the music, coming
from somewhere, perhaps beneath
the foundations. I went away. I
never saw him again.

We DRAW AWAY FROM the mansion, THROUGH the Garden District
streets, PAST huge Magnolia trees, PAST iron fences.
Oaks hung with moss.

LOUIS (V.O.)
That's my story. You have it all.
I go on, night after night. I
feed on those who cross my path.
But there is no passion in me any

Malloy staggers out of the room. He makes for the

throws him down. Malloy is weak, his throat torn.
