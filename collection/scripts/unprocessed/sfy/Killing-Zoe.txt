INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY

Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi
zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.

Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the
cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic
loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not
permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that
they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other
automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get
their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is
Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".

Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE
UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes
shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red
hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.

He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy
going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.

			ZED
	Hotel Mondial.

			CAB DRIVER
	Le Mondial.  Tres bien.

He starts driving.

			CAB DRIVER
	Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un
	moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause
	du 14 Juillet.

He drives for a while.

			CAB DRIVER
	[Do you mind the radio?]

Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also
looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du
Bois.

			CAB DRIVER
	[Do you want me to turn the radio off?]

			ZED
		(realizing he's being asked a
		 question)
	I don't speak French.

The driver turns around.

			CAB DRIVER
		(in broken English)
	Ah.  American?

			ZED
	That's right.

			CAB DRIVER
	That's good because I speak a little
	English.

Zed nods.

			CAB DRIVER
	I asked if you mind the radio.  Music.
	You know.

Zed shakes his head "no".

			CAB DRIVER
		(with a smile)
	Super cool.

Zed adjusts his watch.

			ZED
	What time is it?

			CAB DRIVER
	Time, time, time.  I don't know.
	Daytime.

Zed forgets the adjustment for now.

			CAB DRIVER
	Are you in town for business?

			ZED
	Yes.

			CAB DRIVER
	It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big
	rooms.

He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.

			CAB DRIVER
	Do you know Paris?

			ZED
	I've been here once before.  When I was
	younger.

The cab driver smiles.

			CAB DRIVER
	Those were the days.

They drive for a while.

			CAB DRIVER
	Married?

			ZED
	I beg your pardon?

			CAB DRIVER
	Do you have a wife?

			ZED
	No.
		(then after thinking about it
		 for a while)
	Why?

			CAB DRIVER
	Well, if you need a wife for the night...
		(searching for the right words
		 in French)
	Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter.
		(then back to his broken
		 English)
	For business.  I give you my number.
	Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you
	were young.

He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger
tightly extended together, then he crosses them.

			CAB DRIVER
	Know what I mean?

Zed smiles at this and nods.

			CAB DRIVER
	Speaks the language of love.  Take you to
	heaven and back.  You just tell me and I
	set it up.

Zed shakes his head and laughs.

			CAB DRIVER
	What you laughing at?  You let Moises set
	it up.  She treat you right.  She treat
	you fine.

Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.

								DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY

A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel.  From
around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.

Zed is right behind him.

They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed,
walks into the room.

He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and
proceeds to show him the room.

Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.

			BELLBOY
		(in broken English)
	Your package...It arrived in the last
	night of before last night.

He points to the telephone.

			BELLBOY
	Ah...telephone, for the room service.

He motions toward the bathroom.

			BELLBOY
	The toilet.

He opens the closet door.

			BELLBOY
	To hang the clothes.

He points to a control console next to the bed.

			BELLBOY
	From here you can operate the television.

Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.

Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money,
he starts fingering through it.

Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which
bills to give him.

			BELLBOY
		(after getting what he wanted)
	Merci.

He starts to leave.

			ZED
	Oh, wait.

The bellboy turns around.

			ZED
	What time is it?

			BELLBOY
		(confused)
	What time is it?

			ZED
		(pointing at his watch)
	Time.

			BELLBOY
	Ah.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures
	moins dix.

The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.

Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is,
and takes a seat on the bed.

Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit
and lays back on the bed next to the package.  Before he
dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on
the bedside table.

He is asleep.

							  FADE TO BLACK:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY

Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in.
Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.  Inside
of it is a black steel briefcase.

The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.

On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M.
Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of
folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:
45.63.53.37.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his
face and cascade down his body.

He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits
some out with a spurt.

Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.

He turns the shower off.

Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his
way toward the knocking.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped
around his waist.  He opens it.

In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than
twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but
she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.

			ZOEY
	Bonjour.

			ZED
		(a little awkwardly)
	Bonjour.

Zed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the
room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way
to the window for a view of the city.

			ZOEY
	Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne
	suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.

She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to
examine every detail of the room.

			ZOEY
	Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la
	nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra
	porter un--

			ZED
	I...don't speak French.

She blows a bubble.

			ZOEY
	It's okay.

She takes a seat on the bed.

			ZOEY
	It will be one thousand francs for all
	night.  In advance.

Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.

			ZOEY
	We can do it now if you want.

			ZED
	Well, let me just dry up.

			ZOEY
	Okay, but it's not necessary.

He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.

She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the
television from the remote console.  A French talk show comes
on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station
playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu".  She
smiles and sits back to watch.

			ZED(O.S.)
		(from the bathroom)
	What's your name?

			ZOEY
	Zoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like.

			ZED(O.S.)
	My name's Zed.

			ZOEY
		(smiling at this)
	That's funny.  We both have Z names.

Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His
pants are on.

			ZED
	What was that?

She notices his pants.

			ZOEY
	You can take those off.  The pants.

			ZED
	I'd rather watch you get undressed first.

			ZOEY
		(matter-of-factly)
	Alright.

She stands up and starts to lift her top off.  He stops her.

			ZED
	Slower.

He lays down on the bed.

She stands there looking at him and then smiles.

			ZOEY
	Alright Mister America.  Zed.

Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she
slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her
eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.

			ZOEY
	Slow enough for you?

Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the
bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.

She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin
to make love.

On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays.

Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't
resist during a moment of passion.

She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.  An IMAGE
overcomes her mind.

They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both
satisfied.

She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.

			ZOEY
	C'etait formidable.

She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.

They rest there for a while...holding each other.

			ZOEY
	I'm cold.

She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.

			ZOEY
	Zed?

			ZED
	Yes?

			ZOEY
	Moises told me you were in town for
	business.

			ZED
	Yes.

			ZOEY
	What kind of business?

			ZED
	Why?

			ZOEY
	I don't know.  I'm just curious.

			ZED
	Do you ask all your clients questions?

			ZOEY
	No.  Just the ones I like.

			ZED
	So you like me?

			ZOEY
	Yes.

			ZED
	Why?

			ZOEY
	Because you're...a good person.  I run
	into some real creeps.  You know.

			ZED
	How do you know I'm a good person?

			ZOEY
	Body language.  We fit together.

			ZED
	All men and women fit together.  Hell,
	even some men fit together.

			ZOEY
	No, but you know, we clicked.  You made
	me orgasm.  Do you know how often I
	orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?

			ZED
	No I don't.

			ZOEY
	Usually never.  They're almost always fat
	like pigs.

Zed laughs at this.

			ZOEY
	And you make me feel safe.  That's
	something more important than the orgasm.
	An integral part maybe of the orgasm.

			ZED
	I never really thought of it like that.

			ZOEY
	Well, it's true.

Zed nods at this.

			ZOEY
	Turn off the television.

Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.

			ZOEY
	So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like
	you very much.

			ZED
	Well, I like you too Zoe.

			ZOEY
	Honest?

He nods.

			ZOEY
	Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can
	orgasm.  Even with his own hand.

Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.

			ZED
	Well, I like your honesty.  You're open.
	Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.

She doesn't like the sound of this.  She slaps him.

			ZOEY
	I am not a prostitute!

Zed is a little surprised at this.

			ZED
	Really?  Can I have my francs back then?

			ZOEY
	I'm a student.  And to pay for the
	classes I became an escort.  It's my
	choice to sleep with you.

			ZED
	I see.

			ZOEY
	What?  You don't understand.

			ZED
	No, I do.

			ZOEY
	Hey, it's not easy.

			ZED
	I didn't say it was.

			ZOEY
	I'm here because I want to.

			ZED
	Okay, okay relax.  What school do you go
	to?

			ZOEY
	The Centre du Art, Paris.

			ZED
	That's really interesting.  What kind of
	art do you study?

			ZOEY
	Not any of the old shit.

			ZED
	Oh.

			ZOEY
	I have a day job too.  Three times a
	week.

She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as
she talks to Zed.

			ZOEY
	But someday there will be only my art.

			ZED
	What kind of things do you paint?

			ZOEY
	I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects.
	Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with
	no narrative.  I want when someone looks
	at one of my objects for there to be no
	reference to the world.  Void of feeling,
	emotion...void of destiny.  Those are
	left for me.  They belong only to me.  If
	someone else can see into it...then it is
	no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I
	would destroy it.  I don't care how much
	cash they would offer me.  It would be
	shit.  I can't tell you how many objects
	of mine have been destroyed.  They told
	too much about me.  And if someone wants
	to know something about me...I'll tell
	them myself.  The way I'm telling you.

She looks back at him.

			ZOEY
	What I do I do only for the objects.

			ZED
	I'd like to see one of these.

			ZOEY
	What?  So you could see the work of a
	whore?

He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.

			ZED
	Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a
	prostitute.  I didn't understand the
	difference.

			ZOEY
	The difference is a prostitute would have
	lied to you about her orgasm.

He gives her a kiss.

			ZED
	If these things you make are as true as
	you are...I'm sure they're as
	indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll
	make one...about me.

			ZOEY
	If I do...you'll never know which one it
	is.  Because I'll be the only one who
	understands.  I'll be the only one who
	can look into it and see where in my life
	it came from.

Zed is unable to speak.  They look into each others eyes for
a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in
through the window.  Then she leans forward and gives him a
soft understanding kiss.

								DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHT

Zed is asleep.  Zoey is asleep in his arms.

There is a knocking at the door.

Zed opens his eyes.

The knock becomes a pound.

Zed gets up and puts on his pants.  Zoey gets up and looks
around.

			ZOEY
		(groggily)
	What time is it?

			ZED
	I have no idea.  Night time.

There is more pounding on the door.

			ZOEY
	I'm going to take a shower.

She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower.

Zed walks over to the door and opens it up.

Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age
wearing baggy French-style clothes.

			ERIC
		(with a thick accent)
	Hey you madman!

Zed's happy to see him.

			ZED
	Eric.  Come in.

They hug.

			ERIC
	What happened to you?  I thought you were
	going to call.

Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love
making around the room.

			ERIC
		(smiling)
	Oh I see.  You have been busy.

			ZED
	Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a
	wake up call.

			ERIC
	That's good, but now I am here.  So let's
	go.  We have a lot to talk about.

			ZED
	What about the girl?

			ERIC
	Is she your girlfriend?

			ZED
	No.

			ERIC
	Fuck her.

He peeks into the bathroom.

			ERIC
	She's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out.

			ZED
	I'll let her stay here tonight.

			ERIC
	Don't be silly.  It's dangerous.

Eric walks into the bathroom.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door.  Zoey is
obviously surprised to see him.

			ERIC
		(in French with English
		 subtitles)
	[Okay.  Get out of the shower.  It's time
	for you to leave.]

			ZOEY
	[Fuck you.]

Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower.

			ERIC
	[No.  Come on you fucking slut!]

She shrieks.

			ZOEY
	[Let go of me you shit!!]

He drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Zed can't believe this.

			ZED
	Eric.

			ERIC
		(to Zed)
	Don't worry about her.
		(to Zoey in French)
	[Why don't you just go back to your pimp
	and suck his black dick!]

She bites his hand.  He yells in pain.

			ERIC
	God damn it!

He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door.

			ERIC
	[Get the fuck out of here you fucking
	whore!]

He opens the door and throws her into the hall.

INT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHT

Naked, Zoey falls into the hall.

Eric slams the door shut.

She is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds
on the door.

			ZOEY
	[Give me my clothes you asshole!]

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

She is pounding on the door.

			ERIC
		(looking at his hand wound)
	God damn it.  Look at my hand.

			ZED
		(shocked at the whole incident)
	Jesus Eric.

			ZOEY(O.S.)
	Ouvres!  Je veux mes habits!

Eric listens.

			ERIC
	Oh shit.  Her clothes.

He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and
throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at
him.

			ZOEY
		(almost too quick to
		 understand)
	Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?

			ERIC
	La ferme!

He slams the door shut.

Then he turns to Zed.

			ERIC
	So tell me, what have you been up to?

Zed sits down on the bed.

			ZOEY(O.S.)
	Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!

			ZED
	Eric, I liked that girl.

			ERIC
	Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me.

			ZED
	Because you were on a rampage.

			ERIC
	Look, your whole life you've done nothing
	but fuck whores.  A girl like that will
	give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice
	girl in the suburbs?

			ZED
	Because when you need to get off you
	don't want to have to date for months to
	do it.

			ERIC
	Just use your hand like me.

			ZED
	Sometimes you just need honesty...and
	security.

			ERIC
	I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too
	late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet
	the boys.

			ZED
	Okay, let me take a shower.

			ERIC
	No, in Paris it's good to smell like
	you've been fucking.  It will make them
	respect you.

			ZED
	Oh.

			ERIC
	Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.

Zed starts to get dressed
