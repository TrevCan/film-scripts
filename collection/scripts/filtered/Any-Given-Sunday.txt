REVISED SHOOTING SCRIPT
May 1, 1999

"... Any man's finest hour -- his greatest
fulfillment to all he holds dear -- is
that moment when he has worked his heart
out in a good cause and lies exhausted on
the field of battle -- victorious."
Vince Lombardi

FADE IN:

EXT. "SHARK" STADIUM (MIAMI, USA) - LATE DAY
(ANY SUNDAY)

MUSIC sets a mood of mystery, verdure, sky... Grass sways
gently in the wind, silence to the world... Then a
football is placed in the grass. The large, taped
knuckles of a center grasp the football for the snap.
The world is still, coiled like a spring...
CREDITS RUN...

GAME 1 MINNESOTA AMERICANS AT MIAMI SHARKS - FIELD #1 CONTINUOUS ACTION

An EXPLOSION on the field -- as bodies crash against each
other like armies. The game as played and felt in "the pit".
A swift, short pass over the middle... A tight end
(Miami) takes the hit... Then the quarterback (Miami)
goes down hard. A blur of motion. A WHISTLE BLOWS and
referee #1 signals first down; chains are moved.

HELICOPTER #1

A steep view of the proceedings -- godlike, evoking
ghosts, wind; as if the football gods look down on their
human combatants and vote for first downs, touchdowns,
careers, lives... These overheads punctuate the film...
The silence lingers briefly -- before the Announcers'
voices bring us back to the media reality of the late
20th Century...
TUG KOLOWSKI (V.O.)
(on TV)
... And what a beautiful day for
football it is here in South
Florida!! It's Sunday, and the
sun is shining and playoff berths
are on the line. It doesn't get
much better than this! Don't you
think so, Kevin?!
KEVIN BRANSON (V.O.)
(on TV)
That's the one thing you and I can
agree on, Tug. You can almost
feel religion in the air here at
Miami's 'Shark' Stadium.
The MUSIC THEME -- a blend of martial, choral, and rock
and roll -- is now swallowed in the ROAR of the CROWD...
SMASH CUT TO:

FIELD #2

... the technicolor eyes of quarterback JACK "CAP"
ROONEY, hostage to anger and pain, as his aging frame
crashes on the dirty grass.

SIDELINE #1

Head coach TONY D'AMATO, a striking, intense man in his
50s, moves in a five-yard swath of the sideline, his eyes
flicking worriedly to his fallen alter-ago.
TONY
I've been doin' this for too many
years...
(at McKenna)
You mother...!!! Goddamn ass...!!!
He's giving it to Leslie McKenna, the right guard, and
the other linemen, as he senses the game is now shifting
momentum -- against him.
TONY
... 'mother!... you candy ass...
no blockin' bitches!... 68?!
McKenna, get your brain-dead head
out of your ass!! You're not
blocking, you're tip-toeing through
the tulips!...

SIDELINE #2
DR. ALLIE POWERS, 30s, the new internist with the team,
grabs his doctor box and starts onto the field.
TONY
Powers! Get the hell back here!
Where you going?! He's fine!
Powers sheepishly u-turns back to the sideline where DR.
HARVEY MANDRAKE, the grey-haired team orthopedist, gives
him a second scolding.
MANDRAKE
What are you thinking, Allie?!
There's 1:43 on the clock! You
walk on that field after the 2minute warning and we
automatically lose a time-out.
Wake-up! You been here almost a
goddamn season!
POWERS
Sorry -- I thought he was hurt.

FIELD #3

As LESLIE McKENNA (#63), the big right guard, helps Cap
up, knowing he's blown the block.
TUG (V.O.)
Yes, sir! That's the real deal
right there. Cap Rooney... Two
Pantheon Cups. Almost 50,000
passing yards. More touchdowns
than I care to remember...
CAP
(rising, to McKenna)
McKenna, you fat bubble of lard!
One more block like that, you'll
end my career!
TUG (V.O.)
... our computers rank Jack Rooney
one of the top five quarterbacks
of all time when it comes to
pressure situations... At 39 he
may be a step or two behind -- 12
off-season operations have a way
of doing that to you -- but he
still stands head and shoulders
above these new kids...

WIVES' SECTION #1 (VIDEO)

CINDY ROONEY, a sweet-looking blonde, waves back as she
notices the electronic eye gazing down on her; other
wives join in.
BRANSON (V.O.)
.. Without a doubt, Tug! 'Rock'
Rooney also happens to be married
to a heckuva nice gal sittin' down
there in the stands just like the
star struck fan she's been since
their college days together at
Michigan -- that's Cindy Rooney,
folks, and I can tell you...
TUG (V.O.)
Stop boasting, Kev! But beautiful
she certainly is, un-hunh!... And a
mother of three beautiful children...

SIDELINE #3
Coach D'Amato fumbles with his newly-mangled headset,
consults his plastic-coated single-page game plan, into
his mouthpiece:

TONY
Nick, where the hell are we here?!
Whatta ya think -- Ace Right 90
Cadillac? 60-40 against?

INTERCUT WITH:

COACH'S BOOTH #1

NICK CROZIER -- 40s, star offensive coordinator, in his
first year here, handsome, a comer -- studies the game
below through instant computer printouts. In the booth
are several offensive and defensive assistants.
TONY (V.O.)
... they been giving Sanderson the
inside. If we roll Cap left, Les
and Madman can handle the backside.
CROZIER
(into headset)
I'd say 75-25. But let's try -slot right switch and if they
bring the bandit, we check to 99
max...
(relays call)
Okay! Slot Right Switch 90 or 99
Cadillac.

SIDELINE #4

TYLER CHERUBINI, the stoic, 32-year-old perpetual back-up
quarterback relays the telex signal from upstairs, on his
headset to the field via walkie-talkie -- in addition to
various body signals, both legitimate and deceptive.

HUDDLE #1

QB Cap Rooney bangs on his helmet; something in the
electronics is off. He glares at his teammates, and
though at times he chews them out like a Marine sergeant,
there is an unmistakable affection for his line. He
tries his hardest, like an aging Boy Scout, not to curse,
not always successfully.
CAP
Damn headset! Never goddamn works
when you get hit!! Every damn
time! Damnit, Madman! That
sonofabitch is headhunting!
(MORE)

CAP (CONT'D)
Hold him, rip out his goddamn
eyes, but don't let him mess with
me! I'm too goddamn old!

PATRICK KELLY, his massive right tackle, known around the
league as "MADMAN," bleeds from his nose, but adores his
QB.
MADMAN
Cap, I'll keep him off ya even if
I gotta bite off his thumb!
CAP
You do that!
(to SANDERSON, the
star wide receiver)
... Get yourself open, goddamnit,
'Sandman.' If you gotta coldcock
him, I'll find you.
SANDERSON
Hey I'm there, Cap! In the wind.
Just fling it, baby!
CAP
(to the second wide
receiver)
'Zonker'! You're number two, get
open, run your dig route at 15...
(to the huddle)
Okay, listen up, Slot Right Switch
90 or 99 Cadillac, check with me,
and kill any sonofabitch tries to
cross that line before his time!
On three. Ready!
They clap and break. With 15 seconds to play time, the
constant barrage of "voices" inside Cap's helmet ceases.

MEDIA BOOTH #1
TUG KOLOWSKI -- in the flesh -- is a boisterous, boozy,
veteran sportscaster, alongside KEVIN BRANSON, a young and
upcoming TV-type who seems Tug's opposite, bland and safe.
TUG
... But not all is paradise here in
Miami. Cap Rooney may be on his way
into the record books, but for Coach
Tony D'Amato it's been a dismal
season with attendance sliding, as
the crosstown Dolphins prosper...
INTERCUT WITH:

STANDS #1 (VIDEO)

Reveals the stadium at two-thirds capacity.

SIDELINE #5 (VIDEO AND FILM)
Tony, on TV display, talking intensely into his headset,
takes us past defensive coordinator MONTEZUMA MONROE -60s, a monument of a man, former star linebacker, now
limping noticeably. He glares strongly, rarely moves.
With him is 34-year-old vet LUTHER LAVAY, linebacker and
the captain of the defense, black, built, and a total
predator. His nickname: "SHARK."
TUG (V.O.)
... With three straight losses and
a slide from four years ago when
they won two Pantheon Cups in a row,
D'Amato's going to have to
struggle to get his aging team
into the playoffs! But today is
looking good for the Sharks,
leading the Americans in the second
quarter, 21-17.
BRANSON (V.O.)
... They still got those holes in
that offensive line, Tug, but the
biggest problem has got to be the
defense, and Montezuma Monroe
knows it...
An ASSISTANT offers Monroe a set of digitally-produced
enhancements of the Minnesota offensive formations.
MONROE
Get that shit outta my face!
Shark -- what the fuck's goin' on
out there?! We gotta get more
pressure on the goddamn
quarterback! That motherfucker's
splitting our seam 15 yards every
goddamn time. Now fix it!
SHARK
I'm on it, Coach.
He stomps toward the defensive unit.
BRANSON (V.O.)
... there's also of course the
impact of management decisions on
the Sharks' turn in fortunes...

OWNER'S BOX #1 (VIDEO)

As seen on TV, several family friends and VPs mill
around, but we only see the back of elegantly-attired
blonde President and co-owner, CHRISTINA PAGNIACCI.
TUG (V.O.)
No question, Kev! Since the death
of 'Big Daddy,' Art Pagniacci -his daughter and new President of
the team, Christina Pagniacci has
made some -- many people think -questionable financial decisions in
letting three All-Pro Bowl selections
leave town for free agency.
BRANSON (V.O.)
... although she did bring Julian
Washington in from K.C. A big
1500-yard back...

FIELD #4 (VIDEO AND FILM)
JULIAN WASHINGTON, 27, an extremely strong, sexy,
solidly-built, 230-pound running back, sets, his teeth
blazing with jewelry and facial paint on the far edges of
the Association's rule book (The Associated Football
Franchise of America). He presently goes into playmotion.
TUG (V.O.)
... who can be great when he's not
hurt. And his heart's in it. And
here we go!
Rooney barks out the numbers, "hot reading" the coming
blitz. The clock slows, as his eyes flick from the key
safety to his own team. Can they handle the confusion
of the audible?
ROONEY
(audibling)
Set! Blue 83... check, check...
Arizona 99 Cadillac, Arizona 99
Cadillac! Hut! Hut! Hut!
The Shark linemen read the shift... but Madman is clearly
confused... blocking assignments are missed.
Cap takes the snap and fades back to pass, but he's an
inch too slow and a year too old -- his arm in the air,
about to release, he is brutally blind-sided by a fast
reptilian defensive end. Simultaneously, a blitzing
safety hits him in the lower back with his helmet. Cap
goes down hard again, landing on his own blocker's helmet
at an awkward angle -- he screams loudly -- and this
time, nothing moves.

SIDELINE #6

Tony is looking at his worst fear come true. An eerie
quiet momentarily pervades the stadium. D'Amato breaks
it, yelling at Dr. Powers.
TONY
Get the hell out there! Move!
Can't you see he's hurt?

WIVES' SECTION #2

Cindy Rooney shares the uncertainty.

OWNER'S BOX #2

Still standing with her back to the window, Christina
talks to a friend.
CHRISTINA
... well, until I'm on the
finance committee, I have zero
say on network negot...
As she becomes aware of the hush in the stadium, she
turns to look -- then up at the TV for the slo-mo replay.
BRANSON (V.O.)
... Every Shark fan has a
sickening feeling in the pit of
their stomach at this moment. I
know I do. Cap Rooney is down and
in obvious pain.
CHRISTINA
Dammit! Who was on the weakside
safety?! Was that McKenna, you
f -- ?
She reaches for a red phone.
TUG (V.O.)
Man oh man! Did you see that
collision?! His body went in five
different directions!
INTERCUT WITH:

TV MONITOR

shows the injury in slo-mo. Xs are drawn over Cap's
knees by Tug's finger on the telestrator. A big O goes
over Cap's back.

TUG (V.O.)
Ouch! I've been there and that is
a world of pain!

MEDIA BOOTH #2

Branson covers his microphone and hisses at both a
technician and Tug:
BRANSON
Stop showing that for Christ's
sake!...
(on camera)
We'll be right back with Cap's
condition after this word from our
sponsors.

FIELD #5

Drs. Mandrake and Powers, and Trainer #1 attend to Cap as
he rolls back and forth, in intense pain.
SANDERSON
Suck it up, Cap...
My back!

CAP
MANDRAKE
(feeling for the
injury)
Straighten your legs. Wiggle your
toes. Alright, Cap, they cut to
the commercial. You can get up now.
CAP
(through clenched
teeth)
I must've broke my back!!
MANDRAKE
Come on, babe, you're still moving
your feet. There's no way you
broke your back!
POWERS
Where does it hurt?
CAP
(screaming)
Right where you're touching,
you...!! I swear... I can't
breathe...

MANDRAKE
Neither can I -- it's the
humidity. Do I gotta get you a
stretcher now? You that old?
CAP
(shakes it off,
pulls up)
Dammit! I'm walkin' outta
here!...
(rising)
Oww -- my butt! It's like a knife
in it!

The stadium applauds as Cap hobbles up to his feet.

SIDELINE #7

Back-up QB Tyler Cherubini nervously jams index cards with
play calls under the clear plastic holders inside his
special wristband, intersecting Coach D'Amato.
TONY
Nice and easy, Ty, okay. We're up
21-17. Hold on. Steady 'em.
Cherubini AD LIBS and jogs onto the field. Fans stomp
their feet in sync with the driving beat of the
inspirational "Shark Theme."
BRANSON (V.O.)
We're back! And Cap Rooney looks
to be all right. Listen to that
crowd!
Cap crosses towards the bench on the shoulders of Powers
and Trainer #1. Tony intersects briefly, but he doesn't
seem to want to confront this, makes light of it.
TONY
You all right, 'Rock'?
His sometime nickname for Cap.

Yeah!

CAP
(winces)
Hurts like a...

TONY
Way to hold on to that football,
kid! Take it easy, we'll finish
this up without you -(CONTINUED)

BRANSON (V.O.)
Back-up quarterback Tyler
Cherubini hasn't seen a lot of
action recently!

FIELD #6

From the BOOTH POV -- the team claps and breaks from the
huddle.
TUG (V.O.)
Hate to tell you, Kev, it's a
little scarier than that. Tyler
Cherubini hasn't thrown for a
first down all season!... but it's
going to take a nail and a coffin
to keep Cap down on the farm
warming the pine. This may only
be a game but to Cap Rooney it's
the only game in town.

FIELD #7

Tyler Cherubini scans the defense, sees all the signs for
another impending blitz.
CHERUBINI
(long count)
Set! Red 14 Ace, Red 14 Ace!
Check, check! Black 90 Razor,
Black 90 Razor! -- Hut! Hut!
Minnesota attacks with everything they've got...
Cherubini never even sees the light of day as he is
buried, coughing up the ball -- which bounces into the
hands of a surprised Minnesota safety -- who sprints
20-some yards into the Miami end zone for a touchdown!
The fans go wild with rage, booing the fallen Cherubini.
BRANSON (V.O.)
Oh my gosh! Touchdown! And the
Americans go up 23-21. Man-o-man!
Did they nail him! He's...
Cherubini's not getting up!

TUG (V.O.)
Two quarterbacks down, one after
the other. This is crazy! I
think they just lost Cherubini,
too! My God! I haven't seen this
since... the Aztecs and Pharaohs
in '88 -- or was it '78?

OWNER'S BOX #3

Christina watches the fiasco with her husband, ANDY
MATTER, a young handsome lawyer, and two VPs of the
team -- JOHNNY POLITO, in his 50s, and ED PHILLIPS, in
his 60s -- a distinguished man with a comforting aura,
the family advisor from her father's era.
CHRISTINA
(into the red phone)
Oh, Jesus! Vincent, get me the
names of who's available out there
in the quarterback market right
away, would you?... and how 'bout
every available line coach -maybe somebody who can actually
teach this line how to block!!
A young woman raised to appreciate football, her outburst
quiets the dozen people partying in the box. Her mother,
MARGARET PAGNIACCI, an elegant older woman, who looks out
of it, mostly quasi-drunk or drugged, though she does a
superb job of concealing this with her fixed and
dignified expression, inquires:
MARGARET
What is it, honey...?
CHRISTINA
(ignores her)
... find out about Malloy. Why'd
Denver cut him? Where is he?

SIDELINE #9
WILLIE BEAMEN, third-string QB, 26, black, sits on the
bench, as accustomed, not expecting to be called on.
QB COACH
Beamen! What the hell are you
doing? I told you to warm up five
minutes ago! Look at your
wristband -- it's upside down.
Take your head out of your ass.
Let's go, you're up!

TUNNEL #1

Drs. Mandrake and Powers enter the locker room tunnel
with Cap Rooney when TRAINER #2 yells after them:
TRAINER #2
Doc! They need you back!
Cherubini's down!
MANDRAKE
Cherubini! What -- he fall off a
bench? What the hell's next?!
Stigmata!
(to Powers,
re: Rooney)
... Just sit him out and don't
touch him till I...
TIME CUT TO:

FIELD #8

The Americans kick off.

SIDELINE #10

As the kick returner downs it in the end zone, D'Amato
huddles with Willie Beamen, who is adjusting the speaker
sound in his helmet.
TONY
Beamen, it's you now. Left Deuce
Zig 22 Tomcat. Easy hand-off
to Julian, okay?
Right.

WILLIE
CROZIER (V.O.)
(on helmet)
Willie, can you hear me? You're
gonna be all right. The Americans
got no profile on you. Use it...
surprise 'em.
Willie looks for Crozier upstairs in one of those
anonymous boxes, lost in the roar of sound and the sea of
faces.

WILLIE
(difficulty hearing)
... do what?
TONY
You're gonna do fine. Look at me,
son. You're gonna do fine...
(tapping over
Willie's heart)
You hold it all inside. Stay
there. Stay focused.
Right...

WILLIE
Tony slaps Willie on the shoulder and sends him out.

MEDIA BOOTH #3

TECHNICIANS and assistants frantically adjust as Tug and
Kevin rifle through papers during the commercial break.
BRANSON
Get me more stats on Willie Beamen
now!
TUG
Cap's out... Man, I can't believe
this...
BRANSON
You know anything about Willie
Beamen?
TUG
Who the hell's Willie Beamen?
TECHNICIAN
We're back in five, guys!

HUDDLE #2

Willie is ignored in the huddle, hesitant -- he tries to
shut out the stadium noise.
BRANSON (V.O.)
As we wait for word on Cap
Rooney's condition, Miami's
sending in third-string
quarterback Willie Beamen. Willie
is 26 years old.
(MORE)

BRANSON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
A 'mystery man,'seventh-round draft
pick out of Dallas, he went to the
University of Houston. In his fifth
year, his first year with the Sharks,
he's seen four teams in his
professional career...

Willie tries to hear the QB Coach's voice in his helmet.
VOICE (V.O.)
(helmet)
Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat. Watch
the mike backer, he'll probably
be coming. Relax and show me
you got it!
Willie turns and waves to the sideline.
VOICE (V.O.)
(helmet)
No... tell them!
WILLIE
Awright, guys! Come on listen
up!... the call is Left Deuce Zig
22 Tomcat.

HEY!

McKENNA
(to the rest)
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

On?

TUG (V.O.)
(during this)
... D'Amato's gotta be losing his
mind -- a 14-point turnaround,
lost his starter, his back-up, and
maybe the game in two plays! What
a disaster! It's an absolute...
On?

WILLIE
WASHINGTON
(intense)
SNAP COUNT!
Willie is trying to suppress dry heaves.
You all right?

WASHINGTON
Holy...!

WILLIE
Augghh... Ugghh...

Willie suddenly rips off his helmet and vomits.
SANDERSON
(leaping back)
Oh, shit -- !

SIDELINE #11

Shark Lavay, the middle linebacker, is standing next to
Monroe.
SHARK
Did he puke?! Did he just puke on
the sacred turf?!

MEDIA BOOTH #4

Tug is laughing heartily.
TUG
(to Branson)
Oh, man! Hey, Kev' -- shades of
you the night we went out after
the Cleveland game.
Kevin shoots him a look, and rifles through some papers.
BRANSON
... Beamen even played cornerback
for a while when he was at San
Diego, where he was injured in his
third year...

OWNER'S BOX #4

Christina is now on a black field phone:
CHRISTINA
Soon as you know, you call! If
this is serious, Harvey, I need to
know yesterday, you understand
what I'm saying?!

HUDDLE #3

WASHINGTON

Fuck, man! I've got to get into a

Get it together, nigra...

Come on, son, let's play ball!
VOICE (V.O.)
(helmet)
Would you run the play already!

FIELD #9

As they move towards the ball, Willie glances in several
directions -- it's terrifying -- the Minnesota defense is
shifting position, confusing him; the crowd is deafening,
the cameras zooming in, the sun blazing.
MINNESOTA TACKLE
(greeting Willie)
Better get ready, motherfucker!
I'm coming and I'm gonna be
picking peanuts out of your ass!
MADMAN
Come to Mama first, loudmouth!
MINNESOTA TACKLE
Oh yeah! Through you, 'round you,
upside down you, you useless
mother...!
Willie intensely scans the defensive alignment.
ceases when he yells:
Set Red 378!

WILLIE
Red 378!

Hut!

All talk

Hut!

Willie steps back a little too fast and too far. He
spins towards Washington, awkwardly handing the ball off
on a delayed slant... Washington shoots into a different
hole than assigned -- a dangerous runner, gaining ten
yards from nothing.
In the backfield, the taunting defensive end slaps
Willie's helmet hard as the whistle blows. Willie barely
has time to breathe before he hears "the voice of God" in
his helmet speaker:
VOICE (V.O.)

Thunder Left Smoke 90 Sally.

giant defensive linemen close on him. He sees a brief
opening onto Sanderson 15 yards downfield -- throws far
too high -- almost intercepted by the safety.

FIELD #11

At the line, Miami players immediately sense the defense
is stacked up to the right for Washington's run.
WASHINGTON
(urgently, under)
Audible, man -- change the play -Willie realizes it too -- audibles too quickly and too
softly to communicate accurately.
WILLIE
Set! Green 41 -- um -- switch, switch...
Red 70 Blackstar, Red 70 Blackstar
... Hut!
The snap -- Miami is hopelessly confused. There is no
such play as "Red 70 Blackstar" and players run this way
and that. After several athletic moves, Willie is
bounced out of bounds, eight yards behind the line of
scrimmage.

SIDELINE #13

Tony is having a really bad day, about to throw his
mangled headset away again.
TONY
(to Crozier and
QB coach)
What the hell was that?! What's
he doing out there? Does he know
any of these plays?
CROZIER (V.O.)
Tony, he knows the basic package
but he's only taken a few snaps.

FIELD #12

Washington yells at Willie on the way back to the huddle:
WASHINGTON
What the fuck is Red 70 Blackstar,

Willie fades back to

FIELD #15

The rush is on again. Willie, scrambling out of the
pocket, avoids several tacklers, but his eyes give away
the 25-yard pass... The defensive back steals it from
Sanderson and runs it back 10 yards. The crowd roars
with disappointment. Referee #1 whistles -- ending the
half.

SIDELINE #17
Coach D'Amato shakes his head, picked up by the TV
cameras.
TUG (V.O.)
That was bound to happen, the way
this kid's movin'. Too fast, just
too fast. He's gotta be nervous
out there! He's ahead of his
receivers... Thank God that ends the
first half with the sun going down
on this delayed and chock-full-ofsurprises game...

INT. SHARK LOCKER ROOM - LOCKER ROOM #1 - HALFTIME NIGHT

With 10 minutes to go, the offense is concentrated in one
part of the room on chairs, the defense in the other -listening to analyses and looking at video pictures from
their respective coaches.

TRAINER'S AREA #1

Madman's got the flu, and is dehydrated enough to require
two I.V.s in either arm. Dr. Powers reads his
thermometer.
POWERS

MADMAN
I was light-headed at kick-off,
Doc. Now I'm at the 'one foot in
the coffin' stage.
POWERS
You're a couple of quarts low,
Madman, you just need an oil
change...
MADMAN
Yeah, then why are my legs one big
knot, Doc!? I need some
cyclobenzaprine...
Powers sees Dr. Mandrake hurry past, follows him.
POWERS
Harvey, just a sec...!
Mandrake barely breaks, waits.
POWERS
I'm worried about Cap -- he's
losing ankle strength. I think
he's got...
MANDRAKE
(surprised)
What'd you do? Examine him?
Look, Allie, you're actually one
of the few relatives I can stomach,
but you're the internist. I'm the
orthopedist, remember? You leave
my people alone...
POWERS
I just think that...

MANDRAKE
Need a job description review?
Bone, muscle, joint -- me. Runny
nose, diarrhea, pink eye, gonorrhea
-- you. Sports injuries me;
anything that drips, sticks, or
stinks, or stinks, you. Okay?

MANDRAKE

heads toward a small exam room where Cap waits alone -bypassing Cherubini, the forgotten QB, waiting to have
his knee examined, attended to by TRAINER #2, a
stutterer.
TRAINER #2
Doc, what about Rhodes? He's
really in p-p-pain...
MANDRAKE
He's a hypochondriac. Give him
some ibuprofen.
TRAINER #2
He doesn't wanna put that sh-shit
in his body. He wants Demerol.
MANDRAKE
You think I want to be banished to
Siberia as an ice hockey doctor?
Tell him to clench his teeth.
CHERUBINI
Doc, what about my knee?
What about it?

MANDRAKE
TRAINER #2
Well, I think m-m-maybe I can get
him to t-t-take some Alka-Seltzer.

EXAM AREA #1

Mandrake closes the door on Trainer #2. Cap is with
Trainer #1. He puts Cap's x-ray up on the screen.
MANDRAKE
Bad news, Cap, you're okay, it's
just a bruise. No ribs broken.
Back's normal.

CAP
... something's definitely wrong,
Doc! My butt's killing me... I
think it's a...
MANDRAKE

Lou, prep me 20 C.C. two percent

TRAINER'S AREA #2

Powers attends to Madman, who suddenly has an urgent look
on his face.
VOICE (O.S.)
(yelling out)
Three minutes!
Doc!

MADMAN
Pull the pipes!

Can you...

I gotta go!

POWERS
MADMAN
I mean... I gotta go!
the wild, man!

Call of

He goes, IVs trailing, Powers calls out to Trainer #1 for
help.
LOCKER ROOM #2
With shouts of "Get out of the way!", "Coming through!",
Powers and Trainer #2, protecting the I.V.'s,
follow a surging Madman into the bathroom.
BEAST MAN
(as they go past)
Whoo-hoo! Shark football!
Whatever it takes!!!
Other players chorus in, hooting and hollering, till the
coaches shut them up.
BATHROOM #1
The stalls are filled.

MADMAN
(yelling)
Hey, shitheads! It's me -Madman! Who's on my toilet?!

Madman kicks open a broken stall and finds an unlucky
rookie staring back at him.
MADMAN
Rookie, this is reserved!
fuck out!

Get the

Terrified, the rookie runs out; then Madman forces his
way in, managing to squeeze Powers, Trainer #2 and
himself into the stall.
POWERS
Don't bend your elbows...
Crozier, studying a stack of computer printouts, enters.

Madman?

Yo!

CROZIER
You there...?

He whacks on the door, which opens on Madman sitting with
his pants around his ankles, I.V.s entering each
outstretched arm, ministered to by Trainer #1 and Dr.
Powers. Crozier is amused but hardly surprised; to
Madman:
CROZIER
The three technique is really
getting up field on you. We're
gonna rub him with a fullback this
half.
MADMAN
Coach, let's run the draw or let
me cut his ass on the screens.
That'll slow the motherfucker down.
And show them what I truly am!
A genius!

LOCKER ROOM #3

The players are gathered around Coach D'Amato, who now
addresses both offense and defense.

TONY
Look, you the offense, why do
you think we work on the blitz
package all week? We've lost two
quarterbacks in one half of
football 'cause our line can't
pick up a goddamn backside bandit
on max protection!! You and I
know this is goddamn stupid
football, and you're stressing
this shit outta me! We've worked
on the calls over and over again
but you have no goddamn focus or
concentration! McKenna, keep your
head on a swivel, you've got to
slide out there and pick up that
robber -- roll up those outside
linebackers! Beamen, know your
site adjustments! Sanderson and
Fox will break off their routes
but you have to deliver it on
time. We've had two goddamn
turnovers this half, you guys are
dumping on my turnover ratio.
You the defense, you've got to
create something out there, you've
got to start flying around the
fucking ball and hitting somebody.
Don't let these assholes chew up
the clock on us! On first down,
they're killing us with the
weakside slant. Corners, when we
put eight in the box, you've got
to jam the receivers, take 'em on,
you're hesitating! If you're
gonna make a mistake, go on! Make
it a big one! I'm not gonna eat
your lunch for that, but don't
fuck around like pussies at a pee
party, you hear me?!... P.J., Mac,
Beast Man, Horny, Shark! One, two
yards less each time and they'll be
two and eight instead of two and
six! Stuff the goddamn run.
They're killing us!
No more stupid penalties, okay?!
Concentrate. Focus. We're only
down by three points. We can win
this mother! I'm sick and tired
of losing! Are you?! Three losses
in a row.
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
Are you guys sick and tired of this?!
Stand up if you're not! Raise your
hand! Raise your hand if you're a
pussy! Stand up, let's go!
The team is poised, clenching up, except for Washington
who rises laconically.
TONY
What the hell you doing, J?!
JULIAN
I didn't want you to be the only
one standing, Coach.
A tense moment -- then all bust up laughing, including
D'Amato.
TONY
Gentlemen, this is our house!
We live here. Don't let them fuck
with us in our own house! We're
gonna get some points on the
goddamn board if I gotta get out
there myself and throw the goddamn
ball! Now let's go and kick some
second-half butt!
SHARKS
(as team)
Football, ahhhh!!! WHATEVER IT
TAKES!!!

BATHROOM #2

As the team roars out of the locker room, Madman is eager
to rejoin his crew.
MADMAN
Doc, I gotta go!
POWER
No! Stop! Your I.V.s!
bend your elbows!

Don't

MADMAN
(a sweet baby look)
Doc?... Do you mind?

Powers understands that if he can't bend his elbows that
he... he sighs and wraps a stretch of tissue paper around
his hand -- as Mandrake pokes his head in the stall,
enjoying the view of Powers wiping Madman's ass.
MANDRAKE
Say, Allie, you want to get a
little Chinese food later and talk
about this...?

EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

Winter's night has now fallen as the team hollers,
exiting a narrow tunnel onto the field. The stadium is
charming but decayed (1930s WPA architecture) and in need
of significant renovation...
Jimmy Sanderson, the young star wide receiver for the
Sharks, repeatedly adjusts his shoulder pads, talking to
himself as he walks; he is all hands and nerves, a
thoroughbred with a sweet personality.
SANDERSON
I am precision-honed, musculartempered steel. My moves are
cosmic. Time to save the day.
My legs, torso and arms are
energized powerthrust dominant
weapons... I can save the day!
SHARK
(bypassing Willie)
Who's that you're throwing to,
kid? The receiver or you got some
other shit on your mind?
Willie gets the message. Several fans, intoxicated, hurl
profanities, peanuts, beer, seat cushions at the Sharks.
One OBESE FAN in particular:
FAN
You stink! Hey, Beamen! If you
could chuck a football like you
chuck vomit, you'd be an all-pro,
ha ha ha!
Willie ignores him, but when the Fan throws his beer at
him, it empties on Madman, who is rushing out last, his
IVs gone. Enraged, Madman roars and tries to go up into
the stands after the unlucky Fan, but is restrained by
teammates. AD LIBS...

MADMAN
You think that's funny, asshole!
I'm gonna eat your fucking lunch,
buddy!! (etc.)
TIME CUT:

SCOREBOARD #2

THIRD QUARTER. MINNESOTA 31, MIAMI 21. 7:14 remaining.
Minnesota has increased its lead by one touchdown.

SIDELINE #18

Tony paces anxiously.

FIELD #14

The Miami defense tries to stop a long gainer by the
Minnesota running back, propelling his 230 lbs. right at
Shark Lavay, who upends the running back, one on one...
Shark is the best open-field tackler on the Sharks,
but as he takes those few extra beats rising, adjusting
his shaken frame, congratulated by teammates, his expression reveals the wearying price he pays -- at 34, going
on 50 -- for this leadership role.

SIDELINE #19

Powers now kneels next to the defensive end, Beast Man,
coming off the field onto the bench with an agonizing,
dislocated finger.
POWERS
(to Trainer #2)
Lou, get him X-rayed before I set
this!
BEAST MAN
(vehement)
How 'bout sometime next week, Doc!
How long you been here! I don't
give a fuck if I'm blind, deaf,

Powers hesitates as Mandrake passes by, sees the problem,
and makes the adjustment without thinking.

MANDRAKE

Oh for God's sake, Allie! It's
just a...

POP! Beast Man's FINGER CRACKS back into place.

You're still gonna need an X-ray
after the game, Beast Man, okay?
Beast Man mutters something venomous under his breath,
and moves off.

FIELD #15

Using his bare white foot, the smallish Eastern European
Miami kicker drills a graceful 38-yard field goal through
the uprights.
TIME CUT:

FIELD #16

Everything moves fast in the big leagues. Too fast.
Willie again too quickly breaks from the pocket,
scrambling the offensive and defensive lines up and down
the field, tiring them... Unable to find his receiver, he
takes off running; makes it over the middle of the field
for a first down plus another five or ten yards before he
is pulped in two different directions.

SIDELINE #20

Tony, hiding his eyes as if from a car accident, shakes
his head, to Crozier on the headset.
TONY
... Kid's fast, but he ain't gonna
last, Nick!
CROZIER (V.O.)
He was an alright corner at San
Diego till he got hurt. Watch the
feet. Genius ankles, like Julian.

TONY
He may be a ballerina, but where's
the brain? He just called another
play that doesn't exist! Goddamn!
Settle him down, Nick!

FIELD #17

Willie drops back, and without any pressure, throws a
perfect 10-yard interception over the middle into the
arms of a Minnesota linebacker. The stadium turns really
sour, booing Willie as he walks off.
BRANSON (V.O.)
... No word yet on Cap Rooney.
The only thing we do know is, he's
being X-rayed at the hospital, but
right now I'd say it doesn't look
good for the Sharks...

SIDELINE #21

Tony is waiting for Willie, like Ahab himself.
TONY
What the hell was that?! You just
don't fling the goddamn ball
downfield into traffic like...
WILLIE
... Sorry, Coach, I thought it was
man-free and he looked open.
TONY
We called Go Z Read! What the
hell are you doing changing
the play when you feel like it,
without even knowing who the hell
you're...
WILLIE
They was waitin' for the hitch,
Coach. They was there. I had to
go for it. I saw daylight!
TONY
(seething)
Daylight? Shut the fuck up and
listen to me! Listen to me
now!... You're a new player on
this team. You got me?

TONY (CONT'D)
You are nobody to me or anybody
else here till you prove yourself.
And you start that by doing what
you're fucking told! You got that?
I got that.

WILLIE
TONY
Now get out of my face and next
time you're out there, control the
goddamn ball!
He stalks off. Willie, closed off by Tony's intensity,
moves to the bench.

Tony is saying some pretty rough things.

You read lips, Tug?
Hell yeah.

SIDELINE #22

Willie, coming off the field, moves towards D'Amato,
expecting the worst. Instead D'Amato throws an arm
around his shoulders and walks him along the sideline -in a paternal tone:
TONY
Okay, what's wrong, Willie?
What's wrong?
WILLIE
It's moving fast, Coach... but I
know I can do it. I can do it.
TONY
Just take a breath now. Believe
me when I say you can only get
better, kid -- and you don't have
to worry about getting the hook -'cause I got no one left, okay?
He grins.
I stink.

I'm not myself.

Look at me. Look at me, son...
You know how to play the game.
You been playing it all your life,

Right.

WILLIE
TONY
You grew up in Dallas, right?
Yeah.

WILLIE
TONY
Okay, maybe you're back in Dallas
right now. You're enjoying
yourself. You're back in the

calls you for dinner. Go to the
Buick, turn around and I'll throw
it to you, you throw it back. A
game of catch, remember that?
WILLIE
... somethin' like that, yeah...
TONY
My point is -- Willie -- just
forget about the crowd and the
formations and the audibles and
the whole goddamn playbook. Just
focus on this one next pass.
(carefully)
Willie -- go to the Buick and turn
around.
There's a special, soothing tone to the way D'Amato
expresses himself, when he wants. A voice that makes you
believe.
TIME CUT TO:

FIELD #18

Willie walks up to the line. A fierce new concentration
occupying him. ALL SOUND DRAINS AWAY. He is distracted
by nothing! The crowd has become a semi-real
phantasmagoric beast with a thousand eyes. On his own
face there is an extraordinary, savage look -primordial.

He barks out the signals, SILENT... Soundless, he
backpedals, cocking his arm, fingers tight on the laces,
fingernails digging in... his eyes like radar... the
read... one receiver... two receiver... a quick, strong
release... a fast, clean spiral -- yet it seems to sail
for hours through the air.
... Caught by Sanderson at the 20! The beginner's luck
holds when the two Minnesota defensive backs collide into
each other, falling down, and Sanderson runs freely into
the end zone for a TD!... Now -- an EXPLOSION OF SOUND.
The first TD of a career.

SIDELINE #23

D'Amato allows himself a small smile of pleasure -- a
long time coming. The offense is cheering -- alongside
Montezuma Monroe and his defense, who now pay the offense
a little attention.

FIELD #19

Players slam a stunned Willie on the back.
WASHINGTON
... 'less you wanna kick the extra
point, you better get off the
field, dawg!

The Shark mascot -- a guy dressed in a huge foam shark
costume -- dances the "Shark dance"... As Madman trudges

fishhooked me in the mouth with

Willie's eyes looking for D'Amato -- who acknowledges him
from a distance.

Sanderson disrupts the moment, in Willie's face, twitching
as he repeats himself over and over.

Hey, you git it, money! You gat
the magic!
TIME CUT TO:

SCOREBOARD #3
MINNESOTA 31, MIAMI 31.

FOURTH QUARTER.

12:00...

FIELD #20

Willie, playing with some real confidence, runs an option
pass right, and completes a 17-yarder to the second
receiver.

FIELD #21

This time Willie heads left, faking well off his right
shoulder to keep the DBs deep, then takes off on an
adventuresome run through the Americans. He's a naturalborn athlete, but the Minnesota defense exhorts a price
for making them look bad -- pounding him hard after a
13-yard gainer.
INSERTS
At the bottom of the pile, the linemen wrestle one another,
going for the eyes and nuts, anything for the edge (AD
LIBS)... Close to Willie, at the bottom, Madman growls:
MADMAN
Boy, do we got a dental plan for
you, buddy!... Payback time!
We hear the crunch of his elbow and a painful grunt from
the abused party, who presumably "fishhooked" him
earlier.
REFEREE #2
Get out of there, guys! Come on!
Knock it off! Climb out!

FIELD #22
The shoeless wonder boots a 45-yard field goal dead
center through the uprights -- a thing of beauty as the
fans revive their hopes, starting to pick up on Willie
Beamen.

Tony sees the Minnesota defense stacked against the run
right.

Crozier sees the same thing. Especially from this
height, the defensive adjustments are clear.

BREAKS UP
momentarily; under
his breath, to Willie)
Audible left, kid! Just do it.
TONY (V.O.)
Time-outs are for TV. Negative!

FIELD #24

Willie hands off to Washington, who powers into the line,
seeing nothing -- his eyes wild like a horse around fire
-- He rolls along the line searching for the hole -thinks he sees one -- goes for it.
Swack! He is blindsided by the tall, reptilian defensive
end, who hatchets him from high, then drives his helmet
into the ball, which pops out high and loose and crazy.
It is a spectacular fumble -- the kind of fumble all
running backs have nightmares about -- Washington
desperately dives back for it -- but everyone else is
diving too, including Willie.
A swift Minnesota safety makes the snag -- racing past
confused Miami players -- some 24 yards, into the end
zone. Touchdown.
Oh my God!

BRANSON (V.O.)
Oh no!

TUG (V.O.)
Oh yes! Your worst nightmare as a
running back!
BRANSON (V.O.)
Washington was looking for that
first down. Big mistake!
Willie is on his knees, unbelieving... Washington drops
his head, the loneliest man in the world. A gash of
blood crawls down inside his helmet from his forehead.

On any given Sunday you're gonna

Powers, in the b.g., observes Washington's budding scar,
concerned, says nothing.
TRAINER #2
(to Mandrake)
Doc, 'Horny' won't shut up.
we get him some...

Can

MANDRAKE
(irritated)
You tell 'Horny' his perk days are
over! He knows Association policy -it's a 'schedule 5' drug. Give him
two Motrin and tell him to go to a
'witch doctor'...
(as "Horny" suddenly
makes an appearance
on his behalf)
You know you're gonna sue me anyway
for the Motrin, you skinny fuck!
HORNY, a white, runty defensive back and punter, is
rather upset at the large flap of skin hanging from his
foot, which he proudly displays.
HORNY
Look at my fucking foot! Come on,
Doc! Would you want to go on a
double date with 'Tank Top'
looking like this?
MANDRAKE
(seeing the wound)
Get that out of here.
HORNY
How do I get some attention round
here?

MANDRAKE
(rolls his eyes)
Try suicide.
(rushing to leave;
to Powers)
I gotta get down to Cap at the
hospital. They did the M.R.I.,
looks like the disc ruptured.
They're going in tonight. Could
you finish Julian for me?...
Knowing what he's left behind, Mandrake rushes out with
the phone; Powers sidles up to Julian's suture.
POWERS
Hey, J, I'm not gonna shit you. I
know this guy, he's a top plastic
surgeon... I think I can get him
to see you tonight.
JULIAN
What the fuck for?!
POWERS
(how to say this?)
You got a TV contract, don't you?
JULIAN
You know I got a fucking
television contract.
POWERS
... It is on-camera?
WASHINGTON
(suddenly looking
for a mirror)
M'fucker... I'll sew his asshole
to his lips!

COACHES' OFFICE #1 - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

In progress, a dozen or more press -- among them Jack
Rose -- are gathered around Tony, in a lousy mood, giving
out his postgame interviews from his cramped office.
ROSE
(pseudo-amicable)
... So, Coach, what's on your mind
when you run the exact same
running play twice deep in your
own territory? You nervous about
your quarterback's arm?

TONY
You know, Jack, I've always loved
the running game, but I read so much
about it 'cause of you, I decided
I'm gonna give it up.
ROSE
I beg your pardon. The running
game?
TONY
No, reading you.
(as they all
laugh at Jack)
The pass is great, but it's 2-3
guys involved. But a sweep -y'ever really study a sweep,
Jack -ROSE
Student of the game, Coach.
TONY
Eleven men pulling together,
concentrating... like a mind
machine in perfect sync,
hitting every block and hole,
it's so damn beautiful!
Football, Jack, at its purest.
ROSE
Does that mean you're in
disagreement with management,
Coach?
TONY
(looks at his watch)
No, it means I'm late to see
management. Tell you what, if I
don't have the job tomorrow,
you'll be the first one to know,
Jack, okay?

He leaves abruptly.
P.R. GUY
All right, folks, that's it for
today...
Grumbles all around...

EXT. STADIUM - EVENING

The quiet of the empty stadium fills the humid air.
Distant ECHOES of the roaring fans fall off into BIRDSONG
and FROG CROAKS out of the swamps.

INT. ROONEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Coach D'Amato enters to find Cap Rooney in bed, his lower
back and legs supported, a morphine drip in one arm and
an IV in the other, unnaturally white and swollen from
the hits -- doing his stoic best to abide the searing
pain in his back. Flowers fill the crevices of the room.
He's on a speaker phone with the boss, Christina -- while
Cindy, his concerned and devoted wife, acknowledges Tony
with a head nod.
CINDY
(to Christina)
... but did you see the wires? I
mean, why is this being played up
like it's the end, Christina? I
just don't understand -- it's a
minor injury. That's all. Can't
the front office control the spin?
CHRISTINA (V.O.)
Cindy, look, stop worrying about
this! The important thing is this
thing, this... microdisectomy,
went well, it's under control.
We'll make a strong statement in
the morning, okay?... Cap?
(as Cap acknowledges)
I've been researching vertebrae.
And guess what? -- There's a
great doctor in Minnesota.
Rosen. A specialist in rehab.
I'm gonna fly him out tomorrow.
I found out two important
things... Cap?

Yes?

CAP
(mutters)
CHRISTINA (V.O.)
One -- you can live without the
L-5 disc, and two...
CAP
That's good news...

Tony quietly tucks in Cap's sweaty, strewn bed sheets,
preferring not to signal his presence to Christina. He
notices a large black and blue discoloration around the
point of surgical entry in Cap's lower back.
CHRISTINA (V.O.)
... And two, it all depends on you.
We got the bye week. You could be
ready as early as San Francisco.
CAP
That's really good news.
Tony gives Cap some water.
CHRISTINA (V.O.)
I want you to rest up for tonight
and we'll talk tomorrow, okay.
Night, Cap... Cindy.
She hangs up.

Cindy disconnects the call.

TONY
How ya doing, Rock?
CAP
(dopey)
Man, I thought that guy's helmet
would come out through my ass. I
thought I was going to die! They
went in -- took out my L-5 disc.
No big deal ... Did we win?
(as Tony shakes
his head)
The kid didn't cut it?
TONY
Nah, Beamen did okay. It was
Julian fumbled, they beat us by
three.
CAP
Julian, man...
(shakes his head)
... What'd the kid throw?
Shit!

TONY
9 of 14, for 176.
TDs?
Two.

CAP
TONY

CAP
Holy moly!
(awkwardly tries to
sit up, screams)
Oh God, shit!!...
(then calmer)
I can beat this!...
TONY
The pain's bad, kid.
CAP
Comes and goes. I can control my
morphine intake... but I can't get
enough.
TONY
I could use a drink myself.
He pours himself some water distastefully, as Cap plays
with his pump.
CAP
(yelling with pain)
Cindy, did you call the nurse!?
Is this working! Jesus, tell 'em
I'm a football player! Pump up
the goddamn volume!
(laughs)
... and Christy thinks I'll be
ready to play in three weeks...
CINDY
(on phone)
We've been waiting...
TONY
She's dreamin'.
CAP
What is her deal? All these
flowers. I've known Christy since
she was in braces, man. If Art was
alive he'd be here, not a bunch of
flowers.
TONY
She's President now -- what's more
to say.
CINDY
She just didn't want to bother
you.

CAP
Montana, he had something like
this. I'm in better shape. A few
weeks of rehab and I'll be there,
Tony. Playoffs for sure.
TONY
You just gotta get over this
Montana thing, Rock. You're never
gonna be that good.
CAP
Screw you. If I had a decent
coach, I'd be...
TONY
Take it easy, will ya! Don't
overachieve. Breathe. Even at
50 percent, there's nobody better
out there...
CAP
Playoffs... I'll be ready.
Tony touches Cap gently on the head.
TONY
It's late. I'll stop by in the
morning. Get some rest. 'Night,
Cindy.
She acknowledges him.
Tony...

CAP
(as Tony turns back)
Don't give up on me.
TONY
(beat)
You're like a son to me, Cap.
I'll fight for you till the day I
die.
He exits as the PHONE RINGS and Cindy follows Tony out.
Cindy!

CAP
Can you get the phone!

CINDY
Finally! What do you do for heart
attacks? Wait till they pass? 20
minutes ago we rang...
Cap closes his eyes. He can't find a spot of stillness
-- the pain boiling up again.

INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

In a high-rise apartment above the bay, sporting a
glorious view of the curve of the city against the ocean,
shadows play off the balcony from the TELEVISION within
-- a MUTED "End Zone Weekly" plays (NOTE: This is not
Jack Rose's "Sports Corner," rather an ESPN-type national
show).
WILLIE
(on the phone)
Mom, I didn't know I was going
in... sure I woulda called you...
She wants to talk to you.
He laughs and hands the phone to his attractive girlfriend
VANESSA STRUTHERS on the couch next to him -- a longtime
sweetheart, she is studying marketing.
VANESSA
(into phone)
Mrs. Beamen, hi!... Yeah he was
great!... No, I think he was just
nervous...
WILLIE
(UN-MUTING the TV)
Tell her I'm on again!
VANESSA
Oh, Mrs. Beamen, right now! It's
on! You gettin' it?
(to Willie)
I don't think they have that cable
channel in East Texas, honey.
Here it is.

WILLIE
I'm about to do it.

INTERCUT WITH:

ON TV

Shots of Tyler Cherubini going down... Shots of Willie
stepping in.
TV VOICE (V.O.)
... in stepped third-string QB
Willie Beamen, and after a very
shaky start, Beamen hung in to
deliver a surprising game, coming
up just short in the fourth on
Julian 'The Slicker' Washington's
catastrophic fumble. Not that
Willie didn't have his own
nauseating moments!

The infamous vomit in the huddle on national television.
Willie covers his eyes. We also hear upset SCREAMING
from MOM on the phone.
VANESSA
You didn't tell me you threw up!
TV VOICE (V.O.)
... the Sharks are now looking at
a 7-6 record with a very tough
schedule comin' up, but Tyler
Cherubini with an ankle sprain
looks like he'll be ready next
week. Let's hope in any case that
Willie Beamen remembers his Tums
for the Chicago Rhinos next week!
Willie MUTES the TV, taking the phone back from Vanessa.
WILLIE
... It was moving so fast...
you're a cruel woman, Mama!
(more serious)
Uh-huh... No probably not... No, I
don't know yet.
(growing tenser)
Mama, I... look, I'm number three,
there's nothing I... They don't
wanna look!... Yeah, yeah... you
keep prayin', okay. Say hi to
everybody... Uh-huh, you too,
right...
(hangs up, looks at
Vanessa, deflated)
She wants me to start.
VANESSA
Oh, baby, she just wants the best
for ya.
She hugs him like his Mom might.

INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT (10:30)

Dark walls in this high-class hangout are filled with
celebrity photos, especially the Sharks and Dolphins.
Caricatures of the football crowd hang over the bar where
D'Amato, Nick Crozier, and Montezuma Monroe drink.

ON TV
Jack "Ripper" Rose, the local expert on the Sharks, who
seems to prove that the more you know about a team, the
less you really understand, interviews a guest on his
local "Sports Corner."
ROSE (V.O.)
(on TV, to guest)
... Frank, Frank, Frank, you gotta
wonder why D'Amato called that
play when everyone knows J-Man
likes to pick his spot when he
runs... and you're running the
same play twice in a row? Come
on! There's a reason this team
has lost four in a row. Forget
about the offensive line and Cap
Rooney. Forget about moneygrubbing greed-head Christina
Pagniacci who sold three of last
year's stars. And forget about
the defense -- there is none!
This team is just not in sync.
They remind me of my 'ex.'
She had 21 different personalities.
Seven of them hated me...
(as his guest laughs)
No kiddin', I think D'Amato's play
books have consisted of the same
11 plays since 1971. It's gotta
be a shorter list than 'The
History of Jews in Sports,' but
lucky for him, the Sharks have a
couple of teeth left in their
head, otherwise these guys would
be bottom-feeding at 2-14 instead
of thrashin' at 7-6...
BACK TO SCENE
Glancing away from the omnipresent television (several
others dot the bar space, all tuned to sports), Tony
drinks Scotch -- one of several -- his thoughts depressed
and fatalistic tonight. Four losses in a row is a
phenomenon that has never happened to him before.
MANDY, a young glamorous woman, sitting down the bar with
a girlfriend, catches his eye.
TONY
(re: TV)
Glad he's not talking about me.

CROZIER
(during this)
... you play safe, you lose. It's
just not a theory, they can prove
it. You feed a computer all the
games where a coach protected a
modest lead -- 10 points or
less -- 300 games, 10 years,
there's this guy he did this
study at Harvard... it came out
the coaches lost... 71 percent
of the time!
MONROE
71 percent my ass! It can't be
more than 40 percent, probably
less. What's the information they
put in those damn things?!...
Shit, what're you guys gonna do
next -- stick computer chips up my
players' butts so you can monitor
what their shit's thinking?
CROZIER
(sweetly)
That's a great fucking idea, Monty
-- if you had any neuronal
connections left after what -- 20
concussions? -- I might actually
take that as an insult, but...
TONY
(signals the
bartender)
You get any more stats in those
goddamn computers what the hell
you need a coach for anymore? I
mean it's like we're all rushing
forward here -- faster, bigger,
smarter. We're all thinking too
damned much... we're not even
looking around at what we're
passing by, leaving behind...
You know what I mean?
I sure do.

MONROE
The BARTENDER pours another Scotch, beers for the others.
BARTENDER
Here you go, Coach.

TONY
Thanks (nickname)...
(to all, noting his
caricature above)
Y'know, I'm starting to look like
that guy. That's what's fucking
scary.
MONROE
Yeah, a little.
Crozier clears his throat, needs to talk business.
CROZIER
Y'know, Tony, I think we gotta
simplify the playbook for
Cherubini. These Rhino
linebackers are fast little ATVs.
We gotta pick 'em apart with
precision -- Cherubini to two
tight ends; ask the wideouts to
go short over the middle... More
screens, traps...
TONY
Nick, I'm not re-doing the whole
goddamn game plan for Cherubini
with three more games. The
linemen aren't that quick, y'know
what I mean?... and when Cap comes
back for the playoffs, he's gonna
go crazy with a whole new calling
scheme, different rhythms,
shit!...
CROZIER
Tony, what I'm saying is if we
don't redo the game plan, we won't
make the playoffs... and what
happens if Cap doesn't come back
this year?
TONY
(starting to anger)
Hey, Nick -- when you get your
team, you do it your way. But
don't let me catch you telling
anyone Cap Rooney's not comin'
back, okay? I don't care what
Mrs. Pagniacci Junior says. Stay
out of it!... I've seen Cap do
this for years.
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
When he sets his mind to it,
he'll walk right in there -- maybe
'gainst the Emperors -- and he'll
shine just like a new dime, that's
how fucking great this guy is!
Never underestimate 'Rock'
Rooney, okay?...
CROZIER
I'm sorry... But we need a game
plan, Tony, that...
TONY
(changes subject)
... y'know every time I drink more
than two of these, I think of
Jeanette...
MONROE
How is that gal?
TONY
(grimaces)
We try talkin' but we sound like
two undertakers talkin' shop...
MONROE
Great lady, Jeanette.
her up too easy.

You gave

TONY
Y'ever try living with her,
Monty...? She was nuts. Went
fundamentalist on me.
MONROE
(finishes his beer,
to Crozier)
They say a coach needs three
things in this life -- a wife who
shuts up, a dog who licks him
whenever he wants, and a
quarterback who don't get hurt...
So, this turkey's wife took a hike
on him, his dog got run over, and
his quarterback ruptured his
goddamn back, talk about luck.
Gotta piss...
He leaves.
CROZIER
Mind if I join you?

MONROE
Only if you hold your own dick,
kid.
CROZIER
So tell me, Monty, did you really
play with leather helmets in the
good old days?
TONY
(chimes in)
You forgot the fourth thing, Monty
-- a defense! I know it's oldfashioned to keep the other team
from scoring, but it's effective.
MONROE
Kiss my ass, D'Amato. Lemme
tell you something, kid, those
leather helmets were fucking
great! They held our brains in,
'cause back then men knew how to
hit and get hit. When they
allowed face-guards for you
punks, that was the end of the
game that I knew...
As they move off:
CROZIER
Do you defensive guys ever move
your lips when you speak? Or is
it true you all like grunting
better...?
MONROE
I like grunting better than that
techno-babble bullshit you offensive
weenies talk...
Tony's eyes wander, against his will, back to the TV.
INTERCUT WITH:

ON TV

Jack Rose continues to talk a mile a minute -- on camera
and then in background V.O. as we return to Tony.

ROSE (V.O.)
... I tell you right here and now
-- Chicago's gonna wipe us out!
They got a playbook with 200
variations on the pass for
chrissake! Sure D'Amato likes to
act tough and 'keep it simple,
stupid' for our Sharkies, and some
people even think he's a genius
with his book of 75 plays, but
hey, a lot of us think, you know,
like this is no longer the '70s
and the '80s -- hey we're talking
the late '60s when this guy
started coaching -- and you all
know by now how much of a fan I am
of D'Amato getting himself a
lobotomy or maybe cloned with some
goat because anything... even Jack
Kevorkian, would be better than
what we got! Give me some smack!
(high-fives
his guest)
Give me a pound. Give me some
love...

Tony's eyes have shifted back to the caricature of
himself on the wall, a man fatter, older, and more
degenerate than he actually looks. Mandy, the young
woman he noticed earlier, slides up next to him, sits,
sipping a non-alcoholic blue-ice number with a straw.
MANDY
You're that coach, aren't you?
TONY
Yeah, Tony D'Amato.
He shakes hands.
MANDY
Wow! Hi. I'm Mandy Murphy. I
can't believe it. I thought it
was you but I wasn't sure. You
look different on TV.
You think so?

TONY
MANDY
Yeah. You look much better in
real life. You're always yelling
at people on TV.

TONY
(pointing to the
caricature)
Yeah well at least I look better
than that old fart... I think?
You do...

MANDY
TONY
(starting on another
Scotch)
Thanks. How old are you, Mandy?
MANDY
How old do you want me to be?
(as he shrugs; smiles)
I don't think age matters. I
really don't. I think older guys
have a certain thing.
Oh yeah?

TONY
MANDY
Yeah. Older guys are the nicest
guys. At least in my
experience...
(she gently touches
his hand)
You know, I always wanted to meet
you... ever since I was about 17,
I was going with this football
jock -- and I saw you on the
sidelines. You were winning this
big game...
TONY
You mean the Pantheon Cup...?
MANDY
Yeah, that's it! That was wild.
(as Tony laughs)
I'd never repeat this -- only to
you, you promise to keep this a
secret -- ?
I promise.

TONY

MANDY
(whispers into
his ear)
... I uh... started masturbating
to football games watching you...
(also: AD LIBS)...
Tony's taken aback.

She touches his knee, goes further.

MANDY
... you wanna go out with me...
'Coach'?
TONY
You mean like on a date?
MANDY
Yeah, like on a date...
(leaning close)
I got a place -- close by,
quiet... It's a thousand... five
thousand for the night. You won't
regret it...
(pause)
What do you say, handsome?
Thank you.

TONY
I'm flattered, but...

MANDY
You sure? I got friends.
(indicating Monroe
returning alone
from restroom)
I could do your friends too.
TONY
Thanks, Mandy... some other time
maybe.
MANDY
(disappointed)
Fair enough. Hey, good luck with
the team. I'll be rooting for
you... 'Tony'
A plucky kiss on his cheek.
She slinks away, as Monroe sits, enrapt by her legs.
MONROE
Mmmm! Dang! Don't tell me you
passed on that, D'Amato?

TONY
... I must really be drunk.
MONROE
... I heard sex helps your
coaching instincts. But let's get
genius boy to run a stat on
coaches who like hunting and
fishing better than snatch, see
what he comes up with...?
TONY
(laughs, segues)
... you think we're slowing down,
Monty?
MONROE
Shit, we're not getting any
younger. These are long days, 16
hours, something's gotta give.
TONY
... you think you can lose your
coaching instincts?
MONROE
(chuckles)
You never had 'em anyway, so how
can you lose 'em?
TONY
Well, that last play today, there
was a moment when... I didn't know
what to call... that's never
happened to me like that before...
in 22 seasons...
MONROE
Come on, we were on our third
quarterback, Christina was
throwing plays at us every five
minutes, and Julian's about 10
years old upstairs.
TONY
All I have are my instincts. I
lose them... I got nothin'...
(noticing)
Say, what'd you do to Crozier?
Stuff him in the toilet?

INT. TONY D'AMATO'S HOME - NIGHT

The letter "L" is written with a black marker next to the
Americans on the season schedule (Miami is now 7-6). There
are only three games left in the regular season: Chicago,
California and New York. Tony cradles a cordless phone
while drinking Scotch, as a COMPUTERIZED VOICE introduces
Jeanette's voice on the answer machine.
JEANETTE (V.O.)
Please leave your full name and a
message after the tone and we'll
get back to you.
TONY
(into his cordless)
Hi, Jeanette, it's Tony... I was
hoping you'd still be awake. What
time is it out there anyway? I
tried to call earlier but things
got... never mind. Listen...
He walks into his bedroom, emptying his pockets on the
dresser. Pictures of the past confront him -- Jeanette,
a boy and a girl; another of Tony with Cap Rooney and Art
Pagniacci winning the "Pantheon Cup."
TONY
... tell Tommy we gotta game in
L.A. In a couple of weeks. I'm
hoping we could maybe get
together?... I don't have his new
number but... the thing is I'd
like to see him and... and you...?
(he weaves, stumbles
as he looks for
something he dropped
on the rug)
I really miss the shit outta Timmy
and Melinda... Y'know, love to see
them, Jesus! Grandkids, Jeanette,
we got grandkids... Anyway, what's
there to say? Cap got hurt Sunday.
Just another heart-breaking
Sunday right?
(pause)
Okay, well, bye...
He has crossed to the toilet, where he unsuccessfully
tries to urinate -- all over the place. A COMPUTERIZED
VOICE suddenly cuts in to tell him:
VOICE #1 (V.O.)
... Your call has been cancelled.
Please leave your full name after
the tone and record again.

Aw shit!

TONY

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD #1 - NEXT DAY
(NOTE: Potential one of three football practices -- a
brief montage set to music, that leads us to:)

EXT. CHRISTINA PAGNIACCI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION DAY

Tony drives up to a beautiful mansion on one of
Miami's bays in an older, elegant car. As he talks into
an audio-video monitor, the gates roll open.

INT. CHRISTINA PAGNIACCI'S OFFICE/HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
ACTION - DAY
In a large cross-shadowed private office, Christina and
Johnny Polito listen to Ed Phillips on the phone -noticing Tony's drive-up on the indoor monitor... The
walls reveal pictures of Christina with various highpowered individuals in the city; an MBA from Stanford;
others that are competitive at tennis and golf, on
safari and skiing with her husband; shots of her as a
young girl with her dad. In these images of fishing,
riding, hunting, perhaps one senses that Christina was
raised as an only son by Art Pagniacci and forever
embodies the hardness of that fate.
ED PHILLIPS (O.S.)
(into phone)
Well, we think 100 million is
extortion too, Governor... Then
will you file a friend-of-thecourt brief on our behalf if we go
up against the League's transfer
fee?... Great!
CHRISTINA
... you're sure? No public bond
issues -- no extra tax assessments?
ED PHILLIPS
(waves her off,
nodding)
... couldn't ask for more than
that... good talking to you,
Governor. Say hi to Teresa. And
Christina sends a big kiss! Okay.

Hangs up.
CHRISTINA
(excited)
So let me get this straight: the
Governor of California's saying
there's nothing for the public to
vote on, right?
ED PHILLIPS
(pleased)
That's what he's saying. He's got
a way to finance a new stadium in
Hawthorne, with lottery and casino
money! As long as we partner with
this realty company he's pushing...
JOHNNY POLITO
Sure. He owns all that shit land
he wants to get rid of.
CHRISTINA
... he gives us the full concession,
parking, signage, sponsorship money?
ED PHILLIPS
(nods)
... and 100 percent from the
luxury boxes and club seats!
CHRISTINA
(amazed)
My God, L.A. is a dream! You
realize they're giving us the
world, Ed?!
ED PHILLIPS
(downplaying it)
Well, it's certainly good enough to
leverage the City of Miami into a
new stadium.
Oh, Ed!

It's more than that...
(pause, seeing Tony's
car pull up)
I just don't trust Smalls backing
this stadium bond. Dad always
said he was a thief in a tuxedo...

CHRISTINA

She glances at a picture on her desk of her late father.
Beneath it in the silver frame she has had engraved:
"Whatever It Takes."

ED PHILLIPS
What do you expect? Smalls is an
asshole, but he'll deal. He
always has. And he knows we've
got a big glitch anyway.
CHRISTINA
We don't really, Ed, we can...!
ED PHILLIPS
You keep underestimating the power
of the franchises, Christina.
They don't want us! They want an
expansion team in L.A. which they
can make a lot more money with!
JOHNNY POLITO
Bullshit! They want an established
team with a fan base. A new
stadium with a multiplex theater
shopping mall. We're in the
entertainment business, Ed. Think
football in the 21st Century.
ED PHILLIPS
Johnny, have you got some sleazy
little side deal I don't know
about yet?
JOHNNY POLITO
Ed, you're getting old.
ED PHILLIPS
... And you're getting greedy,
Johnny.
CHRISTINA
The Association will listen to
reason. L.A. is an entertainment
empire! It can easily handle two
teams. Here, what? The wrong fan
base. No Hispanic players, no
Hispanic fans...
(off silence)
Ed, if ever you owed Dad a favor,
make it this one! This team will
be born again in L.A.!
ED PHILLIPS
What about the Rosenthal bid?
CHRISTINA
(thinking about it)
$250 million?... It's so low.

ED PHILLIPS
Wasn't so low when your dad and I
started.
JOHNNY POLITO
With a new stadium and a winning
team, Ed, we could sell the team
for 800 million.
ED PHILLIPS
(disbelieving)
You're like your father that way,
darling -- a dreamer... My advice
to you is, sell the goddamn team.
You don't really want to own a
football team, Christina. You're
still young -- start a family.
Christina, conflicted, watches as her housekeeper shows
Tony in.
CHRISTINA
I still like this business.
Let's keep this quiet for now,
Ed, can we?
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
Tony looks hungover and bumps into something, as Christina
crosses into the giant-sized living room.
CHRISTINA
Come in... Morning, Tony.
TONY
Christina... Ed. You know, I
keep looking for the A.T.M.
machines in these houses...
JOHNNY POLITO
I never find one that works.
Alka-Seltzer?

CHRISTINA
TONY
(rolls his eyes)
No. I already had breakfast... at
four this morning.
CHRISTINA
... Hell of a loss, we were so
goddamn close.

Remote in hand, she flicks on a state-of-the-art video
screen.

ON TV

The shot of Washington fumbling in excruciating slo-mo.
CHRISTINA
You know, I can see why my mother
somehow got herself into a drunken
stupor watching football games all
her life... but this kind of play
makes you want to jump out the
fucking window!
TONY
You can run that play a million
times, Christy, but it ain't
gonna change a thing. On any
given Sunday...
CHRISTINA
(overlapping)
'You either gonna win or you gonna
lose. The point is can you win or
lose like a man?' Dad said a lot
of catchy things.
TONY
Actually I said it, but...
CHRISTINA
But he never could stand losing,
could he!
(as Julian fumbles
again)
... But J. just couldn't resist
going for his bonus yards?
TONY
Blame me, not Julian.
call.

It was my

CHRISTINA
... I know it was, Tony -- but
I'll tell you this -- Julian
wasn't thinking about you, he was
thinking about the extra million
dollars he gets when he hits 1500
yards...
(glancing at Ed)
Which, by the way, definitely
helps blow out our fucking salary
cap for next year...

TONY
You're the one who negotiated his
incentive clause.
CHRISTINA
... which is why I'd like you to
sit him out -- then maybe he'll
get his head into the game. And
save us some dollars in the
bargain.
TONY
Pretty smart move, Christy. You
want me to bench my All-Pro back?
Any other suggestions?

A testy edge to the dialogue, as Christina freezes the
image of Julian fumbling. She shows him the sports
section of USA Today -- folded to a condemnation of
the team, specifically Tony. Although raised to treat
Tony like an "uncle" in a large Italian-American family,
the team comes first and foremost.
CHRISTINA
Sarcasm is not a solution. Four
in a row, Tony. They want your
head. Without Cap, it's gonna
take a miracle to make the
playoffs.
TONY
(re: the newspaper)
... Your father'd laugh at this
jerk, Christy. We're a solid
team, and we're gonna get to the
playoffs. This is not the time to
panic.
CHRISTINA
I'm not 'panicking' -- but no
surgeon I know in the country is
saying Cap'll be back by playoff
time -- even with the bye week...
TONY
(waves it off)
Doctors are like lawyers, always
protecting their asses against
malpractice!

ED PHILLIPS
Tony, without the playoffs there's
no more TV money. And frankly, I
don't think we have a chance in
hell of getting this new stadium
bond issue through...
CHRISTINA
(wearying of Tony)
... the economics just don't work -the fact is this season is a
disaster, a write-off. It's over!
Now Tony's headache is getting worse.
TONY
It's 'over'!? The hell it's over!
We been there before -- I can pull
this out. I always have. Worse
things than this have...
CHRISTINA
Dad used to say, 'No intensity, no
victory.' Where the hell is your
intensity, Tony!? We were always
in the playoffs. Four years ago
the only thing we worried about
was winning a third Pantheon Cop!
Now what? We're a second-tier
team, Tony, that's what!
(as he objects)
... No, admit it! You're not
being honest, we're the fifth,
sixth team in this league. We
just don't get the respect
anymore. For chrissake, Tony,
just four years ago we won the
Pantheon Cup! Do you remember!
We beat the pants off
Massachusetts! Dad would be
shocked to see this mess we
created...
Tony is fuming, but a part of him knows she's right.
TONY
(darkly, pacing)
I was there, Christy -- remember?
We're solid, we're just not
inspired. We got too many free
agents...
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
(indicating the
frozen tape)
... Julian's a 'merc' who's here
for the money and he brings that
attitude with him to the team.
The end of the season, he goes.
And we rebuild our running game and...
CHRISTINA
(pissed)
Running game!? Okay -- you always
talk about a running game. But
who cares as long as you win!
People want to watch passes,
touchdowns, high scores! That's
the game now, Tony!... We paid a
lot of money to get Nick Crozier
here from Minnesota specifically
to modernize this offense. But
when I look down at the field I
don't see any new play calling, I
don't see him doing what he does
best. And frankly, what is most
disturbing, is I don't see you even
listening to his calls from the
booth...
TONY
Football is played on the field,
Christina, not in the goddamn
boxes! You knew that when you had
candy stuck in your braces.
When'd you forget it?
CHRISTINA
(bristles)
So you know everything about
everything, right, Tony?
Another silence. Ed coughs. Christina regrets the
atmosphere, throws up her hands and paces.
ED PHILLIPS
(excusing himself)
Listen, why don't you two...
CHRISTINA
(in a yielding tone)
Ed, stay...
(to Tony)
You gripe about Julian Washington
but you completely ignore the
problems with Cap and Shark? I
don't get it.

TONY
If we'd gotten the linemen I
wanted in the first place, our
first two quarterbacks might
still be walking.
CHRISTINA
Think about the future. Do you
know what we could get for Cap
right now? Probably a first and a
third draft choice. He's still
got an arm, and people respect
him. We know he's finished but if
we're smart, we can...
TONY
No, I don't know that, Christy, I
don't! Cap's got two, maybe three
great years left in him. This is
football. Today guys in their 40s
are playing...
(a silence)
Do I gotta remind you he helped
build this franchise, which you
benefitted from? That he's a hero
to the working people of Florida.
And one of the greatest pressure
players of all time. You just
don't cut a man like Cap Rooney!
CHRISTINA
Excuse me -- Cap and Shark were
great, but memories don't pass and
tackle like they used to...
TONY
Shark changed linebacking forever!
He made a quantum leap in the
game!...
CHRISTINA
... And we can say good-bye to
both of them with dignity! With
class! We'll give 'em positions
in the front office, retire their
numbers. A going-away day that...
TONY
(angry)
That goes without saying. But I
am not cutting Cap Rooney or Shark
Lavay. No matter how much 'class'
you do it with.
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
My contract is very clear on this
point, Christy. I coach my way.
I never tolerated interference from
the front office and your father
never interfered when...
ED PHILLIPS
(politick)
Tony, Art spent money like water.
He never really cared about the
bottom line. He wanted to win at
any cost. In the modern game,
with marketing costs high as they
are...
CHRISTINA
Tony, I am not re-signing a sevenmillion-dollar-a-year, 39-yearold quarterback no matter how big
he was.
(pointing to a stack
of budget sheets on
her desk)
I crunch those numbers every month
till my fingers bleed. We make
less money than 90 percent of the
other teams. The economics simply
don't make any sense!
TONY
(intense)
Fuck the economics! Your father,
you hear me! Your father never
interfered! He made it work!
CHRISTINA
(equally intense)
... Because you were a fighter
then! You had intensity, Tony!
But today he'd cut your ass!
Because that's just the way the
game is now. I love this team as
much -- if not more -- than you.
I was born into this goddamn
business, so don't try to make me
out to be some heartless bitch in
a skybox bleeding my players dry...
TONY
What's your point, Christy?

CHRISTINA
(drawing up)
The point is... as much as I
respect... my famous 'Uncle Tony'
-- the team's just not responding
to you, and I'll be damned if I'm
going to let everything my father
fought for slide down the drain
with you at the helm. I will do
anything -- you hear me, anything
-- to bring this team back to
greatness!
TONY
I guess I had nothing to do with
that. It was all your dad... Am I
excused now?
He throws a hard look at Ed, who looks away. Tony stalks
to the door.
CHRISTINA
(after him)
Who's playing the child now, Tony?
Do I have to remind you of what
kind of ground you're on?
Everybody's got to negotiate...
you too.
TONY
(at the door)
Are you saying my contract's up at
the end of the year? And the
'economics aren't there'? Is that
what you're saying, Christy?
CHRISTINA
... You know, you're not offering
me a whole lot right now, Tony...
'Whatever it takes.' I'm just
doing it the way he did it.
TONY
You're not even close... You know
how your dad and I used to
negotiate my contract? We had a
beer and we shook hands.
CHRISTINA
I don't drink beer, Tony.
TONY
(exits)
No, I guess you don't.
Christina shares a look with Ed.
"Beer?"

She shakes her head:

EXT. "SHARK" STADIUM - GAME 2 - CHICAGO RHINOS AT
MIAMI SHARKS - FIELD #1 - DAY

Miami QB Tyler Cherubini releases his throw far over the
head of Sanderson. The crowd boos.
TUG (V.O.)
... this has been a tough start
for Tyler Cherubini, who has yet
to find his rhythm.
BRANSON (V.O.)
... only two for eight so far and
sacked three times. Ouch! 14-3
Chicago. Second quarter. Eight
minutes left...

STANDS #1

Shark fans are sullen. Signs read: "D'Amato is a
Dinosaur"... images of D'Amato in Thanksgiving turkey
feathers, etc. The capacity, again, is at best
two-thirds.

SIDELINE #1

Coach D'Amato talks quietly with Tyler Cherubini and Cap
Rooney, using a cane in civilian clothing.
Willie, ignored, watches from the bench, not warming up.
As Cherubini wanders off, the QB Coach fetches Willie.
D'Amato's eyes now flash on him...
Get Beamen.

TONY

FIELD #2

Shark rages up and down the defensive line, faking a
blitz, baiting the young Chicago QB.
SHARK
Hey you, white-bread! Got your
cup on? 'Cause I'm gonna runneth
it over!!
(to Chicago
lineman)
I'm gonna stomp you, B.J., and
then I'm gonna stomp your milliondollar bonus baby white-ass
quarterback and then I'm gonna go
up in the stands and stomp both
your mommas!

The Chicago QB, made a little nervous by Shark, bobbles
the ball slightly... Shark, reading the trap, finds a
lane through the Chicago line for a crushing hit on the
baby-bonus QB, who pops the ball loose... Miami's "Beast
Man" instantly pounces on it.
Shark, congratulated by his teammates, rises hurting,
and hiding it... In a brief, micro-moment:
HIS POV
reveals:

BLURRING (SPX) ON teammates and stadium.

SIDELINE #2

Willie, in his oddball way, walks up to the edge of the
sideline, with Tony.
TONY
How do you feel?
WILLIE
I always feel good.
TONY
Feel like throwin' up?
Hell no!

WILLIE
TONY
Hey, last time you puked you had a
hell of a game.
WILLIE
That was last time.
TONY
Make a ritual out of it and
people'll respect it... Go right
at 'em. Go with the spread. What
I want from you is concentration.
Focus. Downfield. Every inch.
See it before you do it. You see
it, you do it.
I got it.

WILLIE
I feel it.

TONY
So... What are you waiting for?
Make me a believer.

Willie heads out onto the field.
TIME CUT TO:

FIELD #3

WILLIE
Set Black 33, Black 33, go!

Willie, on a play action pass, takes off running,
gesturing to his blockers, directing his flow like an
experienced back... He is slammed hard after a big 32yard gain to the Chicago 43 yard line; the crowd roars
with lusty approval.
Julian Washington eyes Willie wearily as he bounces up.
Is this kid going to be another runner in his backfield?

COACH'S BOOTH #1

Crozier on the headset upstairs:
TONY (V.O.)
Will you teach the kid how to
slide, for Chrissake, Nick!
Before he kills himself! How many
times I gotta tell you, I don't
need another Julian out there -TUG (V.O.)
There must be a reason why this
kid was cut from so many teams.
Sooner or later these kinds of
quarterbacks get themselves hurt
with wildman stuff like that! For
a few extra yards it sure doesn't
make sense... but that they gotta
learn...
TIME CUT TO:

FIELD #4
At the Chicago six-yard line, Willie surveys the defensive
alignment.
WILLIE
Set, Green 68, Green 68, go!
Julian rushes forward left of Willie for the hand-off -but Willie doesn't give him the ball -- Julian breaks for
a confused micro-moment, then throws himself forward into
the pile -- as Willie races right, as if to run, then
loops a high, curving pass to the second wide-out in the
end zone. Touchdown!

SCOREBOARD #1

reads CHICAGO 14, MIAMI 10.

THIRD QUARTER.

02:41...

SIDELINE #3

The stadium PA SYSTEM explodes a triumphant "SHARK THEME"
as Willie jogs past Tony on his way to the bench,
crossing the kicking unit on their way in...
CROZIER (V.O.)
(into helmet)
Good play, baby! Good call!!
TONY
(to Willie)
What the hell was that?!
Bootleg.

WILLIE
TONY
I know it was a goddamn bootleg!
Julian passes Tony, shaking his head... Willie gulps down
Gatorade as Tony comes after him.
TONY
... Bootleg? Very creative. I
never thought of that in a million
years. In fact, I didn't call
that! I called a goddamn Double
Tight Regular 22 Fox. You know
what that is, son?
WILLIE
Yeah, I know what that is.
Tony gets right in his face, indicates the game plan in
his hand. There is no backing down.
TONY
You run the plays I call -- you
with me, son?!
WILLIE
I'm with you, boss.
TUG (V.O.)
Glad we don't have a microphone
down there, folks, 'cause I
wouldn't want to be on Tony
D'Amato's dark side now, would
you?

As Tony stalks away, Willie's expression is one of quiet
anger.
TONY
(on headset)
Is he fucking with me, Nick, or
doesn't he know the play!?
MONTAGE #1 (WILLIE BEAMEN AS QB)
MUSIC is UPBEAT, as Willie slices and dices the L.A.
defense:

FIELD #5

Willie steps back and throws a precise 25-yard spiral,
aimed for the pocket on Chicago's 5-yard line -- it sails
perfectly to a place where Jimmy Sanderson accelerates to
reach that sweet spot in time where ball and man meet -sailing right PAST US into the end zone, the Chicago
safety trailing. Touchdown!... Willie races down to the
end zone for a celebration.

SCOREBOARD #2
CHICAGO 17, MIAMI 17.

FOURTH QUARTER.

7:03...

MONTAGE #1 - FIELD #6

Willie fires a crisp bullet of a pass to the tight end in
the chancy seam of the zone.

Okay, Switch 60 Bravo -- hold it.

WILLIE
'Sandman,' your guy's laying back -All day.

SANDERSON
WILLIE
How about 88 Turbo?
SANDERSON
That's what you want, money,
that's what it is.
WASHINGTON
Hold it -- that my play.
WILLIE
That was your play. These guys
are done! Let's kill some Rhinos.
Twins Right 3 Zig 88 Turbo. On two.
Ready?
They clap and move to the ball, Washington upset.

SIDELINE #4

Tony watches the new formation, amazed.
TONY
(headset)
... Now what in the holy see is he
doing... Crozier?!

COACH'S BOOTH #2

CROZIER
(actually delighted)
Hell if I know, Tony...

MONTAGE #1 - FIELD #7

WILLIE
Set, Red 88, Red 88, go!
Sanderson races for the left corner -- Willie not taking
his eyes off him, he pump fakes the ball to him -- but
once the Chicago defense commits to his sleight of hand,
Willie bootlegs it towards the right end zone. Two
defensive backs reverse and run right at him. It's going
to be a race to the wire.

STUNT
The DBs have him beat by a yard or so. But Willie leaps
into the air at the 2-yard line to avoid the diving
tacklers. Then, finding himself having to go yet higher,
he flips in mid-air, taking himself over their heads,
pads and all, into a somersault, landing scot-free in the
end zone. TD! Amazing!

OWNER'S BOX #1

Christina can't believe what she just saw, looking at
the:

TV REPLAY

Willie's somersault is something that is going to make
the highlight reel for a long time to come -- his second
week in a row!
TUG (V.O.)
Kev, did you see what I just saw?!
BRANSON (V.O.)
I sure did, Tug! And Miami goes
ahead, 23-17.
CHRISTINA
(to Ed, genuinely
puzzled)
Where's this kid been all this
time? In D'Amato's doghouse?

PRESS BOX #1
Jack "Ripper" Rose also senses a turn in the destiny of
his team.
HIS POV
downstairs AT Willie -BACK TO SCENE

disguise describing a new major athlete... Insert (TBD).

MONTAGE #1 - SIDELINE #5

Willie trots off the field, looking for D'Amato, about 15
or 20 yards away, with daring in eyes that say, "You want
to win or not? Go fuck yourself!"... Cap, next to Tony,
reads the situation, but the rest of the team, standing
and milling, is simply awed by this new discovery.
TUG (V.O.)
If I'm Tony D'Amato right now I'm
looking to the football gods
saying, 'What did I ever do to
deserve this?'
BRANSON (V.O.)
You bet! Tony must've been good
to a lot of widows and orphans
over the years. A back-up
quarterback like this?

ON TV

Tony watching, deeply perturbed at having his plays
changed by this young, arrogant enigma. He keeps it
inside.
END OF MONTAGE #1.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MANSION (MIAMI) - BOAT DOCK - NIGHT
The stars are out tonight. Establishment Miami meets
football jocks meets business supporters meets politicos,
meets sex and alcohol. It's also a charity event,
designed by the Sharks' P.R. Department to deliver a
Children's Needy Fund some million dollars a year, most
of which is being raised tonight -- with, naturally, the
colorful Mayor Tyrone Smalls in attendance.
Julian Washington ROARS up to the dock in a dramatic
CIGARETTE BOAT -- product logos for his sponsors all over
it. Four gorgeous girls cling to him. Flashbulbs
explode, the paparazzi eating this up as much as Julian.

INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
Cap Rooney and his gorgeously-attired wife Cindy now
enter, the glamour couple of the party, though Cap still
struggles with a cane. The photographers descend on
them, clicking.

Watching all from a discreet corner is Tony, interrupted
by three FANS/BUSINESSMEN coming up to him for
autographs; unsuccessfully, he tries to duck away.
FANS
Hey, Tony!... Coach!... How 'bout
an autograph? etc.

EXT. MANSION - PODIUM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A banner reading: CHILDREN'S FUND OF MIAMI. Flashbulbs
and camera idolize Christina presenting a check to MAYOR
TYRONE SMALLS, a boisterous Afro-American in his 60s.
CHRISTINA
... So, on behalf of the Art
Pagniacci Foundation,
(with a glance to
her mom)
I'm glad to present D.A.R.E. with
this $250,000 contribution...
Much applause.
MAYOR SMALLS
(dramatic)
The city of Miami would like to
thank Christina Pagniacci, you are
a great Miamian! You have done as
much as anyone to eliminate drugs
and crime from our city streets...
... and your Sharks have provided
wonderful role models for our
inner-city youth to look up to.
I'm all for it, honey, now let's
get down and party!!
Raucous laughter. People have long come to accept the
Mayor's idiosyncracies. Smalls greets Christina's
mother, a blitzed Margaret, on the podium, escorted by Ed
Phillips. Also there is Andy, Christina's yawning, tired
husband.
Observing this in the crowd are Willie and Vanessa, who
feels herself out of place and underdressed for this
affair. She excuses herself to the ladies' room... as
Willie walks over to Sanderson and Julian.
WASHINGTON
(at Christina)
Definitely some nice hams -- like
to pork her when she ain't lookin'...

SANDERSON
She don't want your ass, man! That
husband dude of her's got her
snatch locked up like Fort Knox
anyhow...
WILLIE
... If you gonna be with a white
girl, might as well pick the right
one, got some pull, the one on top.
WASHINGTON
(overlapping)
I'm already on top. I just want to
fuck her.
SANDERSON
(re: Margaret)
The ghost, baby. The High
Priestess of the Paycheck! Oooh,
tell me there aren't some finelooking 'dimes' here! I gotta get
me some phone numbers 'fore
Heather closes me down. What
about you?
(looking)
Vanessa policing your ass?
WILLIE
Don't worry your little brain none,
'Sandman,' I got a skeleton key
end of my dick fits all locks.

Fans now envelop them, singling out Julian... Vanessa,
returning from the bathroom, her makeup even worse now,
can't help but notice Willie openly gazing at women of
beauty, with finer clothes and jewels.
TIME CUT TO:

EXT. MANSION - GARDENS OFF VERANDA

Shark sits next to Dr. Mandrake's girlfriend TRISH, a
buxom 20-year-old, talking with a very rich ELDERLY
COUPLE and several OTHER COUPLES, who don't notice
Shark's hand finding its way beneath the table between
Trish's thighs...
SHARK
(to Elderly Couple)
... The point of the game, see, is
really about contact -- the more
intense the better.

OLDER WOMAN (V.O.)
Does it really hurt when you hit
someone?
SHARK
Sometimes, but it's all good!

Trish squirms in her chair.

INT. MANSION - BAR AREA

Christina is trying to get the Mayor's attention,
surrounded by his entourage.
CHRISTINA
So, Tyrone, can we talk now...?
MAYOR SMALLS
(for all)
So, where is that bold and
beautiful quarterback of yours,
Christina?
Christina, put off, turns impatiently to Cap and Cindy,
approaching.
CHRISTINA
Cap, say hello to his Honor.
CAP
Pleasure to see you again, sir.
You know Cindy...?
They shake hands, AD LIB.

As photographers snap

MAYOR SMALLS
(to Cap)
Show me some love!...
(to Christina,

... I meant the other quarterback.
You know -- the black dude.
Who?

CHRISTINA
CAP
(overhearing)
He means Willie.

CHRISTINA
Oh, of course.
(sweetly)
Cap, do you think you could find
him...? Thanks. Cindy, you look
beautiful.

Cap and Cindy share a look of disappointment as they go.

INT. UPSTAIRS GALLERY
Tony and Margaret Pagniacci, leaning against an upstairs
railing, take in a view of the party below; Margaret
commenting on the AFFA Pantheon Cup ring that Tony wears
tonight, part of his formal wear.
TONY
... These kinda places I keep
looking for an A.T.M. machine...
MARGARET
... do you wear it often?
TONY
(offering her the
ring)
Nah. Just special occasions.
Looks too weird. I get on a
plane, I gotta check it...
MARGARET
(holds it lovingly)
Art wore his in bed. You know he
spent hours designing it
himself...
(ambiguous)
... he cut my cheek with it once.
I bled.
Tony is unsure how to respond.
TONY
Margaret, we need someone... a
football person out front who
can...
MARGARET
Tony, stop. Christina's in charge
now. It's the way Art wanted it.
This catches Tony off guard.

EXT. GARDENS OFF VERANDA - BACK AT SHARK'S TABLE
SHARK
... it's like, have you ever seen
a woman giving birth? -- lotta
blood, sweat, and tears, right? -Well, football's a man's way of
having that baby!
Trish's hot, flushed face says it all. She adjusts her
panties under the table, allowing better access for
Shark's hand. The others listen intently to Shark.
ELDERLY MAN
(impeccable accent)
What was your best hit, Mister
Lavay?
SHARK
... Well, one time playing in
pouring rain, I'm deep...
(his hand moves)
... deep in the zone... They're
on top, driving. Their fullback
is stuffing the ball down our
throat every play...
Murmuring slightly, Trish stretches, wrapping her lips
around a strawberry from her dessert plate.
SHARK
He comes inside again... I'm
jamming full force into the
hole... wham! Fumble!

Ohhh!

TRISH
(breathless)
Right there...!

SHARK
Oh yeah, right then and there!...
Now the ball's bouncing free. I'm
groping for it, fingers all
slippery wet...
Dr. Mandrake approaches the table.
SHARK
The fumble comes my way... only a
few seconds left on the clock
and...
He sees Trish's look.
Racing the geometry!

He sees Mandrake's distance.

ELDERLY MAN #2
... Well, did you score?

Trish orgasms just in time -- sinks into the chair,
muffling her sounds with a napkin.
SHARK
Hell yeah, I scored!
Mandrake sits next to Trish, sensing something.
conceals her expression when he fondles her.

Trish

MANDRAKE
What do you say we hit the road,
hon?
TRISH
... Oh come on, Harvey, don't be a
fuddy duddy! You're always in
pajamas by...
Mandrake protests. Shark has removed his hand, but
notices Madman nearby, coming on strongly to one of the
local society dames who impresses him with her face jobs
and jewelry. His pregnant, pathetic mouse wife sits
alone in a corner, wanting to cry.
SHARK
(rising, to the
table)
Don't go away!
(indicating Madman)
This guy's turning into my night
job. I'll be right back.
He moves towards the dance floor...
MADMAN
(to the lady, AD LIB)
... What's wrong, let's you and me
cut the rug, honbun!
(pause)
C'mon, I'm not good-looking enough
for you? What do you think, I'm a
damage case...?
Shark grabs him by the lapels and smacks him fairly hard
across the face -- not discreetly. Madman registers
it, then wants to kill, but when he sees Shark, he
grunts docilely...

SHARK
Yo, Madman! I can't take your ass
nowhere!...
(emphatic, as if to
a schizophrenic)
Patrick's wife is in the corner,
Patrick! It's not the time to be
'Madman,' is it?
Shark looks sheepish.

INT. MANSION - BAR AREA

Mayor Smalls embraces Willie in an extravagant bear hug,
as Christina and others look on.
MAYOR SMALLS
Be proud! You are the future of
football in this country, son!
You are a model for your people
now, Willie Beamen! A black man
unafraid! Stand tall and gimme
some sugar, boy!
Willie laughs, hugs the Mayor back.
WILLIE
You're pretty cool yourself,
Mayor...
A photo op develops. Vanessa goes unintroduced -- She
feels very hurt, not understanding why Willie would
ignore her or is he that embarrassed by her? She
wanders for the wrong solace over to Cindy and the other
wives, chatting in a small group.

INT. MANSION - BATHROOM

The once pristine bathroom has deteriorated. Guest
soaps are crushed on the floor, towels in the tub.
Julian and Sanderson cavort with some girls.

EXT. GARDENS OFF VERANDA

Drs. Powers and Mandrake walk together.
POWERS
Sanderson's been after me for
stuff?

MANDRAKE
He's like Jell-O. Just say no and
he'll ooze off.
Guy's got an
insecurity complex the size of
China.
What's he on?

POWERS
MANDRAKE
(shrugs)
I don't know. Rits, vikes. End
of the season I'm gonna put him in
'the laundry bin'
(off Powers, puzzled)
... clinic...
(for Powers' benefit)
... quietly, Allie...
Mandrake senses Powers doesn't understand his approach.
MANDRAKE
Y'ever play hurt, Allie?
(off his puzzled
look)
College, high school, whatever?
Not really.
U.C.L.A.

POWERS
I played baseball at

MANDRAKE
Ugh! I hate baseball. Nothing
happens. Bunch of farmers
standing around scratching their
nuts looking for fly balls. In
football, we all go one way till
we get there.
Where's that?

POWERS
MANDRAKE
Who the hell knows, but what
counts is...
POWERS
Sounds like socialism. Y'ever see
spikes fly in your face, Harvey -or a line drive coming at you 100
miles per hour?

MANDRAKE
(teasing)
U.C.L.A. baseball, ooh, brutal
sport!
(seriously)
Allie, we gotta work together more
-- make sure the guys get there,
know what I mean?
POWERS
(pause, concerned)
... We've always kept our patients
informed, Harv, it's part of the
deal...
MANDRAKE
Where, in Palm Beach? This is Zaire
here! These guys are stealing
hubcaps while you're writing
prescriptions. They have four years
to make a million dollars, that's it.
A short life but it's a goddamn
glorious one! -- as long as you
don't mess with their minds!
POWERS
I don't understand. What'd I do?
MANDRAKE
You messed with Zanucky telling
him he'll be ready in two weeks.
What if he's ready in one week?
Then because of you he'll be
thinking he's not really ready.
POWERS
Well, he asked me, and I...
MANDRAKE
You what?! You know, Allie, I
know young guys would die for this
job. You're making me think I
made a stupid mistake, and I'm
gonna be embarrassed here...
POWERS
Oh, come on, Harvey! I gave up a
lot of income to come here, I...

MANDRAKE
Did you now? You still don't get
it, do you, sport? This is not F.
Scott Fitzgerald in white bucks
time! This is a privilege to be
here! This is a spectacle of
gladiators with brains for the
masses! It's a fucking brilliant
concept! And I don't care if
every one of 'em has to play hurt
-- you, me, the team, we all play
hurt, that's life, sport...!
So do me a real favor and get off
your high horse, and get down
where the worms feed...!

INT. MANSION - LOGGIA

Crozier tries to snag Christina's attention span.
CROZIER
(changing subjects)
... Can I be honest with you,
Christina? It's a waste of my
time. I come up with the edge we
need -- the stats, the
probabilities -- and he just looks
at them and shrugs -- it's like he
doesn't believe it.
I know.

CHRISTINA
CROZIER
It's really frustrating. It's all
gotta be him -- little Napoleon
with his 'instincts'!
CHRISTINA
(looking for the
Mayor)
Be patient, Nick, when the time
comes -CROZIER
I just want you to know I'm
getting offers, Christina, you
gotta know that. I want to stay,
but I won't waste another season
under Tony.
She now sees the Mayor free! and goes quickly.

CHRISTINA
(cryptic, to Crozier)
You won't...! I promise.

INT. MANSION - TEA ROOM - NIGHT

The WIVES hold court.
HEATHER
If my husband doesn't get it five
or six times a week, we have
problems at home.
PREGNANT WIFE
We were at that pace, but we've
slowed down a little.
ANOTHER WIFE
Except on game day.
CINDY
That's when I want it most -but with everything he's on...
Dexamethasone?

WIFE #1
CINDY
And extra-strength hydrocodeine.
HEATHER
Oooh, that mix makes Jimmy crazy.
Can't get it up.
MARY
Count your blessings.
called again?

What's it

Cindy, at the top of the food chain, takes notice when
Vanessa appears.
CINDY
Willie managing to keep his food
down tonight?
VANESSA
(doesn't get it,
smiles)
He's just fine! Hi. I'm Vanessa
Struthers.

CINDY
Jack had such a laugh about that!
I'm Cindy Rooney.
HEATHER
Jimmy had to order new shoes.
(shaking hands)
Heather Sanderson.

Vanessa now understands the reference to her fiance.
CINDY
Are you and Willie married?
VANESSA
No, but we've been together for -CINDY
Doesn't count until you're
married, honey -- and your name
appears in the paper as 'and wife.'
MARY
And not even then, most of the
time.
They all laugh.
CINDY
Do you have a job?
VANESSA
No, I'm still studying for an
M.B.A. in sports marketing. At
Dade Community College. But Willie
and I have had to move so many
times to...
Marketing?
can tell.

CINDY
You're a smart one, I

VANESSA
And what do you do?
CINDY
Me? Oh, I'm married to the best
quarterback in the A.F.F.A.,
that's all. I consider myself
part of a team really...
VANESSA
(not sure of her
attitude)
Oh, that must be very fulfilling
for you...

EXT. BOAT DOCK VERANDA

Christina is at last alone with the slightly-inebriated
Mayor.
CHRISTINA
Why have you been ducking me?
MAYOR SMALLS
I always forget how pretty you
are, Christina.
CHRISTINA
Cut the crap, Tyrone.
MAYOR SMALLS
What's this bug you got?
CHRISTINA
... I want the 250 million you
promised me...
(he looks like a sphinx)
You know I can get the rest with
the bond. You said you'd give me
100 percent support and now you're
getting cold feet just because...
MAYOR SMALLS
... how you gonna pay it back,
darlin'?
CHRISTINA
I already told you -- we'll split
revenue on the club seats, the
corporate boxes, all the concessions,
the stadium-naming rights, and the
increase in ticket sales. There'll
be 10,000 new parking spaces. And
we'll be pulling in almost 40
million in personal seat licenses
over ten years... The concept of a
new stadium, T.J., funds the whole
deal. Without it, no...
MAYOR SMALLS
(mocking)
'Personal seat licenses' -- that's
the biggest bunch of bullshit! -how the hell can you sell the same
seat twice? I seen some pretty
smooth scams in my time, but only a
white man could come up with that
one. The fans gonna burn you, honey.

CHRISTINA
(patiently)
... All the fans really care
about, Tyrone, is winning. And if
I don't have the money I need to
stay competitive, then this team
is finished! That's the bottom
line!
MAYOR SMALLS
There ain't no bottom line, baby.
It's an endless fucking pit!
(genuinely)
Your team's not doin' what the
Dolphins are doin'. The schools're
howling for money, roads need
redoing, a new stadium's the last
thing on the city council's mind...
CHRISTINA
I'm not asking you to vote, T.J.
I'm asking you to deliver! We've
been backing you since Dad's time,
getting your people passes and
money they never dreamed of. We
were there for you, and...
(delicate)
... and if you're not there for us,
T.J., I'm telling you this... we'd
seriously consider leaving this
town.
MAYOR SMALLS
(smiles infuriatingly)
Sweetheart, you outta here when
the city and the county says you
outta here. Your lease ain't up
for two years so don't start
setting fires you can't put out...
CHRISTINA
(sure of herself)
Oh, there's 'loopholes,' Tyrone.
Like the goddamn stadium is
falling apart, you know -- you
haven't contributed one fucking
penny to maintenance on that
relic! I remodeled the practice
facility out of my own pocket.
I...

MAYOR SMALLS
(smiles)
Now that's the Pagniacci I
believe! I see your teeth!
Get down, girl!
CHRISTINA
(resisting)
... We're a pro team, T.J., and
we're playing in a college stadium
built in the '30s, and we're
losin' a ton of fucking money.
When are you...
MAYOR SMALLS
Yadda, yadda, yadda! Daddy's
girl, you are a relative baby in
this town. Go slow. First you
get along... then you go along...
(puts an arm around
her)
Come on, honey, you and I known
each other too long. Your roots
are here in Miami. Why would you
want to leave? Your dad created
such love, such a foundation...
CHRISTINA
Tyrone, I'm telling you again -time is running out and you are
playing with fire.
MAYOR SMALLS
(grins)
That's the only way I play it.
CHRISTINA
(grins back)
Then we'll see how you like it.
She leaves, pissed.

It looks like L.A. for sure.
TIME CUT TO:

EXT. GARDENS OFF VERANDA

The party is getting rowdy as Julian, Sanderson, Madman,
Shark, and others heat up the dance floor.
Cindy turns to a NASTY WOMAN whose breast implants are as
big as her hair.

Nice dress.

NASTY WOMAN
Nice party.

CINDY
(bored)
Thank you. Did you come here with
Julian?
NASTY WOMAN
(threatened)
No, but I'm leaving with him. So
don't even think about it, honey!
Oh please.

CINDY

EXT. BOAT DOCK VERANDA - NIGHT (FOLLOWING)

Montezuma Monroe intersects Mayor Smalls; they know each
other.
Hey, Ty.

MONROE
MAYOR SMALLS
What's up, brother?
MONROE
(indicating Christina)
Hi, Ty... Couldn't help hearin'
that Christina conversation...
MAYOR SMALLS
(shaking his head)
Same old story, brother. Owners
crying broke, y'ever met an owner
who ain't losin' money? These guys
make extra sure the team loses money.
They share a knowing laugh.
MONROE
I tell ya I wish I had a fraction
of those stadium rights -- I'd take
the concessions and parking and
tickets -- that's some real bread
there...

MAYOR SMALLS
Stadium's where it's at. Now they
invented these 'naming rights' and
'P.S.L.s'. It's all tricky doo.
We don't have the money for that
stadium. You guys gotta fight
through it till you have a
successful season. That's the
reality... 'Lady Di' there thinks
she's pulling the wool over my
eyes and going to L.A.

He laughs.
MONROE
(cautiously)
... Now I did hear somethin' about
that?
MAYOR SMALLS
(grins)
... She ain't going nowhere. Keep
it tight, Monty. Either way, you
got a job here a long time to come.
The Mayor returns to the party as Monroe looks down into
the gardens for Tony. MUSIC WAFTS OUT from the party.

EXT. GARDENS OFF VERANDA

Margaret Pagniacci's holding onto Tony's AFFA ring, alone
with him; he's had a little too much to drink.
TONY
'Life begins with a kick-off,' Art
used to say that... He was a great
man, Maggie. He was there at the
beginning. His kind, forget it!
-- dust! Now they're all...
(sees Christina
approaching)
know-it-all-E.S.P.N. analysts.
CHRISTINA
Hi, Tony... We better get going,
Mom. It's getting late.
Margaret rises, handing the ring to D'Amato.
MARGARET
Yes it is...
(to Tony)
... too late.

Christina wants to connect with Tony as he toys with his
ring.
CHRISTINA
... I remember when my dad
designed that...
(an awkward
silence)
I guess I'll have to wear mine on
a chain around my neck, huh?
TONY
How 'bout you win one first?
CHRISTINA
I was just trying to --

No.

TONY
(getting up)
Win one first.

He walks away.

EXT./INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Willie and Vanessa are fighting, tension in the air.
The TV is ON to the Jack Rose's "Sports Center" as Willie
tries to analyze his playbook, an icebag wrapped tight
around his right shoulder.
INSERT - PLAYBOOK
Shows the complexity of the system, the number of plays,
the mumbo-jumbo, which would be tough enough for any
student of the game to learn -- but for Willie, who is
unschooled, it comes hard; his frustration mounting, as
is Vanessa's.
BACK TO SCENE
VANESSA
(volatile)
... were you embarrassed by me,
were you ashamed to introduce me
to the Mayor? Is that it...
Willie?
(as he doesn't respond)
Was it my dress...? ... what
the... Willie?!
Willie changes the subject, indicating the playbook.

WILLIE
Goddamn book! Thinking is dying
on that field. Doing is feeling.
Feeling is what it's all about...
(flipping pages)
I think like this, I'll get killed
out there! I gotta play my way -like 'I'm the shit'! You don't
believe that, you are...

ON TV

Meanwhile, the deranged Jack Rose is going on and on to
his guest.
ROSE (V.O.)
... At his press conference yesterday
-- and with a straight face -- Coach D.
says that there was no problem with the
plays and that Beamen audibled only
twice during the game. Uh-huh!... We
all know Tony the Tiger's a demonic
dude who combs his hair every which
way but up, but I tell ya this guy
could put a positive spin on toxic
waste. Is he for real? Or is it
just me who feels he was probably
coaching the day Ray Nitschke
dislocated Y.A. Tittle's shoulder?
Scary? You starting to get the
picture here, Joe?...

VANESSA
... You're 'the shit' all right,
Willie, lemme tell you joined a
whole lotta shits on that team!
Did you see the way that Cindy
Rooney talked to me? Was my
dress too cheap? Did you give
a shit!... She just about made me
feel like a field hand! Who the
hell does she think she is!
WILLIE
What's her ass gotta do with your
ass? Jealousy look ugly on you,
Vanessa.

VANESSA
(stung)
Oh? What was I so jealous of her
about?
WILLIE
I tell you what -- you're jealous
of anything! You're jealous any
woman who walk in a room with a
better rap or a bag or a fuckin'
hairdo! 'Cause it's always 'bout
class with you.
VANESSA
Class!? You're talking shit!
I got more class than 90 percent
of those skinny wrinkled bitches
in that bullshit party of yours!
Sure you do...

WILLIE
VANESSA
Oh, Mr. Bad Ass Willie! I seen
you in action tonight, chasing the
tail on that Heather Sanderson.
(as he protests)
Why didn't you introduce her to
the goddamn Mayor, Willie, you too
ashamed to introduce me...
(near tears)
... after all these years!
Goddamn your ass, Willie Beamen...
WILLIE
Baby, I wasn't even thinkin' about
the Mayor. And I don't care about
any of those crackhead hoes! I
got one thing on my mind and one
thing alone! I gotta concentrate
on the game or I ain't gonna be
around too much longer, ya hear!
It's my shot, baby, I've gotta
grab these chips while I can.
VANESSA
So whatcha really saying, 'baby'
-- I don't look so good to you
anymore?

WILLIE
No, you ain't listening, you...
I'm sayin' this is my time -- now!
I gotta rope the ring and that
means I can't be fucking dealing
with you running these bullshit
numbers in my head.
VANESSA
No! What you mean is I'm not good
enough for you, Willie, that's
what you mean!
WILLIE
There you go again! Man, for a
college graduate you are plumb
dumb! 'V,' you got so many damned
problems, you gotta blame everybody
else but yourself -- Cindy Rooney,
Heather Sanderson, me! Baby, you
gotta learn to chill!
VANESSA
(infuriated)
'Chill'!? Jesus Christ, Willie,
you know when you get finished
sucking your own dick and playin'
'bad ass football nigger,' give me
a call sometime?
WILLIE
(blowing up)
You mean your ex-fiance give you a
call! You wanna come at me now!
When I'm facing this...
(hits the playbook)
Get the fuck outta here!
Willie stands, slams the playbook shut, stalks to his
bedroom. She tries to grab him and they struggle.
WILLIE
Watcha want!... Don't touch my arm
like that or I'll bust your ass!
VANESSA
You gonna hit me? Oh it's like
that now? Yeah! Go ahead -- get
real, motherfucker!
WILLIE
'Real'!? Gimme a break! Lemme
the fuck alone! (AD LIB)

VANESSA
I see you turning into one of them
'shits'! I tell you this, I'm
gonna call your mama!
Willie looks at her, disgusted.
WILLIE
Tell my mother what! Don't let my
success get to your head, bitch.
(as she protests,
"bitch!")
Go right ahead! And while you're
at it, go find yourself some
'wigger' who'll put up with your
petty, 'educated' hype, 'cause you
gettin' on my nerves!
VANESSA
Yes I am educated and you can't
even read a goddamn playbook,
Willie Beamen, 'cause you're
nothing but a big-ass Mama's boy
and you can take your football -it's the only ball you got anyhow!
-- and shove it up your stuck-up
ass! 'Cause my big, beautiful ass
you can kiss good-bye, baby!
(at the door)
And you know what! -- I will find
me a smart, m'fucking gentleman!
I'm gonna be sleeping at Darlene's
from now on. She might fuck
better'n you anyhow!
WILLIE
You got an ugly mouth on you,
woman! I'm real glad I gotta
chance to see it 'fore our kids
heard it. Get your lesbian ass
outta here!
She slams the door violently on her way out... Willie is
really upset.

INT. CHARTER PLANE - DAY

D'Amato wanders back from the first-class section through
the aircraft. Some nap, others mingle in a subdued
atmosphere. He spots Willie sitting near the back of the
players' section by himself, wearing his headphones. He
approaches, waits.

Willie finally sees him, or pretends to, takes his
headset off, clears his CDs from the empty seat.
TONY
Mind if I sit down?
(as Willie nods,
Tony sits)
Whatcha listening to?
Rap.
Anyone I know?
Biggie.

WILLIE
TONY
WILLIE
TONY
(shakes his head)
Y'ever listen to jazz?
(as Willie shrugs "who?")
... Coltrane, Monk, Miles Davis,
Billie Holiday?
WILLIE
(doesn't know them)
Don't go much for that old stuff.
TONY
Maybe I'll put together a tape for
you -- my favorites...?
WILLIE
I don't use no tapes.

I got CDs.

TONY
So, we'll forget about that... How
'bout your mama, she ever gonna
come to a game?
WILLIE
... She thinks Sunday's for church.
He waits on Tony, who goes the extra yard.
TONY
... I don't know if you know this,
I lost my dad when I was young, too...
(waits)
... in World War Two...
(waits again)
... if you ever want to talk about
stuff like that, I'm around...? Okay.

WILLIE
I'll get at 'cha.
TONY
You know where to find me...
Willie nods, mumbling something incoherent.

IN FRONT SECTION

D'Amato rejoins Dr. Mandrake, reading his Wall Street
Journal.
TONY
Hell if I can figure him out.
Who?

MANDRAKE
TONY
Beamen. I look in his eyes and I
see... nothing.
(beat)
Man never even heard of Miles
Davis.
MANDRAKE
Tony, he probably never heard of
Joe Namath. You look like shit.
You sleeping?
TONY
I'm too tired to sleep.
MANDRAKE
I got some great new samples for
that.
I bet you do.

TONY

INT. HOTEL COFFEE SHOP (CALIFORNIA) - SUNDAY

Tony, in his game suit, has breakfast with his son, TOM,
a bland mid-level executive in his late 20s, with a
Christian fish on his lapel.
TONY
... Really, it's no problem
getting tickets?

TOM
(uneasy)
Well, he's really more into
basketball now.
TONY
(defeated)
... Yeah? How old is Timmy now -nine, ten?
TOM
Eight. But we don't really call
him Timmy anymore...
TONY
Oh, okay... and Melinda?
She's fine...
You look good.
I'm trying.

How's she?

TOM
TONY
TOM
TONY
You talk to your mom lately?
TOM
Dad -- what do you want?
TONY
What do I want? I wanted to see you.
You're my son, for chrissake.
What do you mean?
TOM
I haven't talked to you for a
year. A year ago Christmas...
TONY
... Christ, gimme a minute, Tom,
okay? I haven't seen you in
what...
Six years.

TOM
TONY
You never picked up the phone
either -- so don't...

Why would I?

TOM

TONY
All I ever did was...
TOM
(on edge)
Please don't!... When you do that
you sound like a broken record,
Dad. I get really upset...
Tony looks at him, wondering what he's wrought.
hush as the WAITRESS brings coffee and danish.

They

WAITRESS
Coffee, danish? Why the long
faces?
(off no response)
Enjoy your breakfast.
She leaves.
TONY
... You know I'll never forget a
big mistake I made once as a
coach. I hurt someone and... I
couldn't change what I did, so I
denied it. Threw some money at
it... and then tried to forget it,
block it out.
(beat)
You know what? It never goes
away.
TOM
(now he's upset)
No it doesn't and it's too late,
goddamn it, okay! It's too -excuse me for my foul thoughts,
Lord! They come not out of me -but it's too goddamn late for that!
My son and daughter are doing
fine and you had nothing to do
with that, and that's all there
is.
TONY
Tom, come on, I... I'm sorry.
I...

TOM
Where were you on my Sundays,
when I was playing ball? Just...
just don't even try, okay!
TONY
(now at the end
of his rope)
Can I just... see them? They're
my grandkids, Tom!... Please?
TOM
(a grim pause)
... With a child psychiatrist...

INT. CALIFORNIA STADIUM - DAY
Game 3.

Miami Sharks at California Crusaders.

FIELD #1
The Crusaders' wide receiver runs deep against the Miami
DB, nearly catching a 50-yard pass at the Miami 5-yard
line... A yellow penalty flag flies through the air.

SCOREBOARD #1
MIAMI 7, CALIFORNIA 14.

SECOND QUARTER.

4:49...

BRANSON (V.O.)
Interference on Miami. That will
hurt! A tight game here! Looks
like a man's down now... At the
line of scrimmage, it looks like
the 'Shark' -- Luther Lavay!

SIDELINE #1

Tony is livid at REFEREE #1, not noticing Shark.
TONY
Where was the interference??!!...
Do you realize... No!... You are
giving away 45 yards! Get the
replay! I'll trade you a time-out
for it, you... ugh, ugh!
REFEREE #2 trots by Tony, who jogs alongside, to get his
attention.

TONY
Charlie, give me a goddamn break.
I know this is L.A., I don't know
nobody here, but give us a chance
anyway!
(indicating Referee #1)
Where's that guy from? El Cajon,
Hawthorne, Beverly Hills, what?
REFEREE #2
Get back in the coaching box...

Tony shares his frustration with Cap Rooney, in street
clothes for the game, and Crozier upstairs; Cherubini is
relaying the signals to Willie on the field.
TONY
What can you do? What can you do?
The system's fucked! I mean games
are being decided by zebras in
stripes. It's just not fair!
(then)
What the fuck is 'fair' anyway?

FIELD #2

Shark lies on the field, moaning.
Trainer #1 test his joints.

Mandrake, Powers and

MANDRAKE
Squeeze my fingers.
(as Shark does so)
Great! Do you know where we are?
SHARK
(woozy)
... I know it ain't Munchkinland.
MANDRAKE
Who we playing against?
SHARK
Those ugly motherfuckers.
MANDRAKE
Who's your quarterback?
SHARK
That pretty motherfucker.

MANDRAKE
Well you don't see me playing
possum, do you, Shark? I think
you can get up now.
SHARK
Fuck, this is embarrassing! Doc,
don't let me pull a Willie Beamen.

Powers and the Trainers help drag Shark to his feet.

SIDELINE #2

The crowd cheers for Shark, coming off, as...
TONY
(at Monroe)
What the hell is going on, Monty!
They're leaking and you don't know
where. Fix it, goddamnit. Don't
yell and don't make faces and all
that bullshit! Just fix it!
He leaves Monroe a study in total, betrayed
frustration...

HUDDLE #1

Willie feels loose.
WILLIE
(singling out
Sanderson)
Okay, 'Sandman,' they should show
cloud coverage here and lock Ice
on the cross. The middle will be
open. Right deuce gun, F-shoot,
60 Snake Eyes. On three. Ready!
WASHINGTON
Hey, man, we can't run Snake Eyes
in the red zone!
WILLIE
J-man, you can get on my page or
you can shut the fuck up! On three.
Ready!
They break.

Sanderson hangs back a beat.

SANDERSON
How the hell you see that?

WILLIE
I see things better, brother.
I see the future. Your guy
trailing you on your inside
route. Bend a little and hit the
slim post.

As they move to the line of scrimmage, Madman is lost.
MADMAN
I block the outside backer?
Les'... help me?
McKENNA
You got the nose guard.
Nose.

Face.

MADMAN
Yeah.

WILLIE
Set Blue 468, Blue 468!
Hut! Hut!

Hut!

Montezuma Monroe is rampaging up and down before his
unit, pissed beyond words.

They think you're a bunch of lowbrow Neanderthal shitheads! They
think they're gonna gut you and
leave you lying on the highway
with your insides hanging out for
the buzzards -- !
SHARK
(a huge migraine
of his own)
Coach, you're gonna have a stroke.
MONROE
I don't GET strokes, motherfucker,
I GIVE 'em!
A cry of grief from the crowd stops him. Monroe spins to
the field to see a mad brawl of players for a Shark
fumble -- a Crusaders player comes up with the ball!
And worse! At the line of scrimmage, Leslie McKenna, the
right guard, is down.

SIDELINE #4

As REFEREE #3 signals the California first down to a
joyous echo from the home crowd, Tony is screaming at
Referee #3 who jogs over to him.
REFEREE #3
(wearily)
What is it with you, Coach?!
TONY
Goddamn it, Sammy, his knee was
down! He was down by a mile.
Both knees were down. Give me a
goddamn break in this town -- that
was no fumble!
REFEREE #3
To be honest, Tony -- I didn't
really see it.
TONY
(a beat, shrugs)
To be honest, Sammy, neither did
I.
Referee #3 shakes his head and runs back to the field as
Mandrake hurries over to Tony.
MANDRAKE
Tony -- bad news! Looks like
McKenna's got a distended knee,
torn everything, bloody nightmare
-- he's out!
How long?

TONY
MANDRAKE
If he's lucky -- Easter.
Tony hurries towards Leslie McKenna in great pain -being helped off the field by Dr. Powers and trainer #2.

SIDELINE #5

Julian and Willie are going at it hotly.
WASHINGTON
The play was Snake Eyes Right -Right!
WILLIE
I knew the goddamn play! -Couldn't you see them adjusting?!

WASHINGTON
You didn't audible shit!
WILLIE
I called the color, man! You just
missed it 'cause of that wax in
your ears. Hey, 'Sandman,' didn't
I audible?
I dunno, man.
involved.

SANDERSON
Don't get me

Tony approaches, dominates.
TONY
Knock it off -- all of you! This
goddamn screw-up cost us McKenna
for the season! Why don't you
both think about that for one
goddamn minute! Sit down -- the
bunch of you!
(walking away, to
Crozier, on the
headset)
Goddamn it, Nick, you do your job
and get him under control before
he gets anyone else hurt!
He notices a film crew in his face, recording all of
this; this brings him to the very edge.
TONY
Whatta you doing!! Get outta here
before I kick your butts!!... Get
'em out!
Security quickly closes down the lens.
TIME CUT TO:

SIDELINE #6

The Crusaders sweep towards the Miami sideline, its big
offensive line leading. This time the Miami defense
penetrates them and gang-tackles the running back.
TONY
(to Monroe)
Awright! More like it!
alive!

You look

He turns away, eyeing the scoreboard, as his offense runs
out.
MONROE
(sarcastic)
Thank you, boss.

SCOREBOARD #2

CALIFORNIA 21, MIAMI 10.

THIRD QUARTER 8:57...

HUDDLE #2

Willie suddenly breaks from it and pukes quietly, into
the turf, clears his throat.
TUG (V.O.)
Oh my God. He's done it again!
(needling Kevin)
You know, that reminds me of the
night...
Willie walks back to the huddle, to his teammates.
WILLIE
I apologize -- I had to get that
out of my system.
WASHINGTON
Hey, man, if that's your thing,
just stay off my shoes...
WILLIE
Okay. Let's go. Deuce Right Dog
90 Smoke. On three. Jimmy one,
Andy two, J-man outlet flat.
Right.

SANDERSON
Don't force it in if --

WILLIE
I got it! I'm there! I'm a
righteous motherfucker! On three!
Ready?
FIELD #3
They break and move to the ball. Willie scans the
defense, loose, enjoying himself.

Set Green 21!
Hut! Hut!

WILLIE
Green 21!

Hut!

Willie checks off his receivers as they speed downfield,
pumps once; the offensive line protecting him strongly.
Two L.A. corners blanket Sanderson -- but Julian is open,
waiting in the flat.
Willie!!

WASHINGTON
Willie ignores him, his eyes downfield -- a Crusaders'
lineman is almost on him when Madman slams him aside at
the last moment... Willie takes the shot -- it's a dead
perfect pass, threading the microscopic gap between two
Crusaders' defenders. Sanderson spins in midair so that
the nose of the ball crosses the goal line just as he is
slammed backwards by the backs -- too late -- the Ref's
arms shoot up -- touchdown!
Willie races down the field and grabs Sanderson, both of
them breaking into a funky dance.

FIELD #4

Upfield, Julian, not very happy, heads for the sideline.

SIDELINE #7

As Willie comes off, Tony hugs him in a familiar,
paternal way, which surprises Willie. Cap Rooney
witnesses.
TONY
Don't fuck with a man's ritual,
right?
WILLIE
'Blaze the hot sands.'
TONY
I never understand a goddamn word
you say.
WILLIE
It's all good, boss.
TIME CUTS TO:

FIELD #5

Willie runs an option pass for 26 yards, and when he is
pounded into the turf, jumps right up and taunts the
defense.
WILLIE
You gotta hit harder than that,
baby! I can't feel it!
Which makes them want to kill him -- but Madman and
several others step in to separate Willie.
FIELD #6
Willie, pursued by linemen and almost off balance, throws
an incredible long bomb, hitting his third receiver; the
ball travels almost 60 yards in the air. The receiver
runs it in for a touchdown!
TUG (V.O.)
Wow! As the Sharks go into their
bye week, the story here has got
to be Willie Beamen! He's running
-- he's throwing -- he's rockin'
and rollin' and shuckin' and
jivin'. He's flat out steamin'.
This magic Sunday, he's 'Steamin'
Beamen'!

GUEST OWNER'S BOX #1

Christina, with local friends, studies her new
phenomenon.
SCOREBOARD #3
MIAMI 24, CALIFORNIA 21.

INT. VISITOR'S LOCKER ROOM (L.A.) - LOCKER ROOM #1
- 6 PM
The Shark locker room seems too small to contain the
combustible energy of these larger-than-life men.
Sanderson and other "Dawgs" rally to the BOOM BOX.
Perhaps Willie joins in briefly...
Coach D'Amato circulates, congratulations all around...
Cap doesn't have much to do, hanging. In the b.g., the
doctors and trainers are busy.

Madman opens a locker which is a shrine to the band
Metallica. Madman puts one of their CDs on a portable
player.
SHARK
Oh, man, not that shit again!... I
don't know why I even acknowledge
this m'fucking psycho!
MADMAN
(to Shark)
Metallica are gods! We live to
serve them! We should bow!
As the MUSIC of "SO WHAT" CRANKS, others protest loudly
(AD LIB). Madman ignores them all, banging out the rhythm
on his locker.
Elsewhere, Smitty, the Christian, walks up to Willie.
SMITTY
(coming up to Willie)
Say, Willie, some of us guys, we
have a little Bible study group
that meets every Monday. It's no
big deal, we just read some and
talk. They say 'There's no
atheists in foxholes.'
(chuckles)
We'd sure like it if you could
join us?
No.

WILLIE
SMITTY
Oh super!... May I ask if you're a
Christian?
WILLIE
Fuck you, Smitty.
What?!

SMITTY
WILLIE
How long I been on this team -six months? In all that time you
ever spoke to me? Now I win two
games and you want me to join your
Bible study group? Fuck you.
Smitty moves off...

JULIAN WASHINGTON

is throwing on his $3,000 suit, busy on his cell, while
Willie watches nearby.
WASHINGTON
Forget Doritos! I can do Ruffles, too.
One's a corn chip and the other's
a potato chip, don't you get it?
Tell them I got two different
burger franchises and they don't
give me no static like that!...
Willie catches Julian before he exits.
WILLIE
Hey, J-man, can I talk to you a
sec?
(off no response)
Say, good game today. You know if
I'm faking the hand-off to you, it
looks stupid you don't act like
you're getting the ball, money...
WASHINGTON
Whatcha you saying, you...
WILLIE
Y'ever see a movie? You know,
there's the king, right? But he
ain't no king till the other
actors bow when he walk in the
room, right? He's just this actor
dude... same with us, J. I'm the
Q.B., but you gotta act like I am
the Q.B., you get it, 'cause if you
ain't pretending, it's a fake, it
make me look like some dumb-ass
turkey out there runnin' around
trying to throw a pass they all
know is comin'...
WASHINGTON
Who you talkin' to, you afro
m'fucker! You a king in your own
mind, bitch! You out there
'bowing' to settle your own
bullshit, don't ever approach me
again, faggot!!

TRAINING AREA #1

Dr. Mandrake stitches Sanderson's cut chin, pulling out a
tray of bandages:

SANDERSON
(agitated)
I gotta come down, Doc. My teeth
are ice cubes, man!
MANDRAKE
Try sex, you're making me look
bad. League's already questioning
my benzo prescriptions.
SANDERSON
Man, you're useless! What the
fuck we need a doctor for then?
MANDRAKE
You don't! We're just corporate
automatons anyway. No fault. No
choice. No lawsuit. The way all
society is going. It's you
overpaid m'fuckers wrecked the
party anyway -- 'my body is worth
50 million in bones, muscle, and
tissue, blah blah blah!' You
prescribe some spoiled crybaby the
wrong thing and you're on your way
to re-education camp in Hanoi.
Hanoi?

SANDERSON
MANDRAKE
Vietnam?... Never mind. Or is it
New York now? Corporate culture,
baby! I'm actually one of the few
good guys left -- I stretch it a
bit for you boneheads.
SANDERSON
(reacting to stitch)
Ow!! You sure stretching this
stitch, man!
MANDRAKE
(musing aloud)
You have no idea what it was like
in the old days, 'Sandman' -nobody'd give a shit. I mean we
were kings. No goddamn random
urine tests, no 'spook police'...
(laughs)
Shit we'd force you to take the
pills -- like candy. You could
walk onto the field with a syringe
in your ass and nobody'd notice...
but it's over -- like the weather.

Weather?

SANDERSON

MANDRAKE
El Nino!... Current change?
warming?... Hello?

Global

SANDERSON
You out of your mind.
MANDRAKE
... All 'cause the association's
worth too much money -- now it's
bigger than Coca-Cola or Disney...
(as Sanderson is
puzzled)
Forget it.
(re: the bandages)
So what do you want -- Bugs Bunny,
Daffy Duck, Tweety?
SANDERSON
You got Spiderman?
MANDRAKE
If I had Spiderman I woulda said I
had Spiderman. I got Batman.
SANDERSON
(brightening up)
Oooh, fox alert at 4 o'clock!...
Daddy's girl ambulating... Queen
Christina is here!

LOCKER ROOM #2

The mood in the locker room shifts quickly as Christina
Pagniacci enters, escorted by two security guards in
suits with earphones -- along with her VPs. In a good
mood, she passes most of the no-name players, signalling
or calling out to some of her stars (AD LIB)... Cap
notices her not "seeing" him; Joe Polito makes up for it,
coming over to him, as she approaches Willie.
CHRISTINA
(at her charming
best)
Willie, congratulations, you were
great! Really exciting to watch
out there!!

WILLIE
(a winning smile)
I thrill to chill, ma'am.
CHRISTINA
Two in a row! 'Whatever it takes'
-- right. You make me excited
about the future again...

Others look on at the two of them.
Willie, in his jockstrap, is coming on to Christina in a
cheeky, street way, showing off his muscles. Christina,
accustomed to locker rooms and not seeing her players in
any way as competitive with her husband, ignores the fact
he doesn't add one stitch of clothing to his jock.
Willie senses this gulf and will come to resent it as
another synecdoche for the owner/player class structure.
WILLIE
(quietly)
... I hope you don't mind, but you
handle yourself real good in
business and all. I don't B.S.,
Miss Pagniacci, but you do it to
me. How'd you like to hook up for
a drink, or something quiet...?
CHRISTINA
(a little surprised)
... I'm flattered, Willie, I
really am, but I'm married. I've
just never dated players. It
gives the wrong impression.
WILLIE
You mean you're influenced by what
other people think?
CHRISTINA
I think we all are, in business,
Willie... So, come by tomorrow and
we'll talk. I think you'll like
what you're gonna hear... okay?
(smiles, corrects
his punctuation)
Pagniacci.
She exits. Her eyes catching Tony, on the fly, through
a cubicle window -- huddled with Rooney, Crozier,
and Julian in the cramped visiting coach's office.

COACH'S OFFICE #1

WASHINGTON
... Reebok got this whole ad
campaign ready to go the
minute I hit 2,000 yards. But
it's ABC, man, I don't get the
ball -- I don't get my stats -- I
don't get my money -- and I like
gettin' my money.
CROZIER
This team isn't about your damn
stats!
TONY
For that matter, you're lucky
we're not keeping track of your
blocking 'stats,' J...
WASHINGTON
What's that mean?
TONY
What's that mean? It means y'ever
try blocking for a change, J?
It's not that bad an idea...
WASHINGTON
I'm sick of hearing that shit!
I'm tryin', but blocking's for
those Clydesdale horses, man. You
don't use a thoroughbred to block.
You run his ass.
TONY
That's a winning attitude, kid.
WASHINGTON
How much you payin' that 300-pound
blocker, man? Let him block,
'cause he sure can't run.
CAP
(to Tony)
... Look, J-man's got a point -Beamen's not doing his homework.
He isn't studying the playbook, he
doesn't come in to look at any
films, he doesn't even know the
damn names of the defensive
players he's facing. He doesn't
give a geewhiz about anything or
anybody! He just wants to make
the plays by himself -(CONTINUED)

CROZIER
He's young! He doesn't know how
to 'read' like you do, Cap.
WASHINGTON
Fuck that! He's changing the
plays, man -- all the goddamn
time!
TONY
What? What do you mean he's
changing the plays?
WASHINGTON
I said he's changing the plays -in the huddle. The plays you
designed that I loved. Just does
what he likes.
In the huddle?

TONY
WASHINGTON
I'm not talking audibles, Coach.
Today he did it all day long.
Kid's dissing this play, that
play, saying, 'I gotta better
play.'
CROZIER
Hey, guys, we won. What's the
point here?!
Tony's thinking about it.

SHOWERS #1

Players dance to a BOOMBOX PLAYING in the shower...
Madman tries to join in but looks ridiculous and they
trash him cruelly. Willie showers next to Shark, who,
unseen, seems to lose his balance, grabs onto a shower
head...
WILLIE
(to Shark)
So guess what? Coach suddenly
asks me to dinner. Orders me
morelike.

SHARK
(after a pause)
Hey, that means you made it, kid!
When Coach D. thinks you're the
real deal he brings you over to
his house and shows you his
trophies and shit and makes the
most godawful jambalaya you ever
tasted. One thing though, you
better bring flowers -- Coach gets
really pissed off if you don't
bring flowers.
Flowers?

WILLIE
SHARK
Some petunias or something.
me... When?
Saturday.

Trust

WILLIE
SHARK
That's cool, I'm having a bash at
my place for bye week. Wife and
kids are up North. Gonna be a
lotta trim, so don't go bringin'
no sand to the beach, dawg...
WILLIE
Hey, I'm a born again ladies man!
Madman now retaliates, throwing a baby ALLIGATOR into
the shower, the tiny reptile terrifying most of these
behemoths with its HISSING jaws.

LOCKER ROOM #4

Cap Rooney catches Willie's eye as the latter throws on
some frayed jeans, a beeper and cell phone hooked to his
belt. Adjusting his shades and headphones, he's about to
leave when:
CAP
The thing about a team, kid, is
you can try to lead 'em. But
will anyone follow? You don't
play for the team, the team's not
gonna play for you. Go out there
on your own, you'll die out there
on your own... 'kimmo sabe'?

WILLIE
Say, Cap, how old are you now?

Willie rolls on out -- barely avoiding the press -- who
gather around Shark. Shark, in his underwear, puts his
sunglasses on, bothered by the camera lights.
SHARK REPORTER
Say, Shark, what were you thinking
when you came out of that
concussion?
SHARK
What was I thinking? What're all
these white guys doing standing
around here looking at me, that's
what I was thinking, what a
dumb-ass question! Next?
Which cracks up the reporters.

TRAINER'S OFFICE #1

Cameras mounted, the room lit, Jack Rose has the first go
at Tony, a tiny tape recorder in his palm.
ROSE
So what were you telling Beamen on
the sideline, Coach?
TONY
(warily)
I was telling him how much I loved
him.
They laugh.
ROSE
("friendly" smile)
Follow-up question. You think
your boys could've won the game
without him, Coach?
TONY
Why is it every time you ask me a
question, Jack, it sounds like,
'So, did you beat your wife?' You
goddamn know I don't have a wife,
Jack, and you know I don't play
golf and I hate fishing,
barbecuing, and boating. I
guess... wall-staring, I'm pretty
good at that.

ROSE
You still didn't answer the
question, Tony...?

It's like a routine between them -- on the edge of
danger.
TONY
No I didn't because I tell you
what, this is what I got to say to
you about the game, Jack: Fuck
you, you stink, you know you
stink, you wouldn't know the
truth if it was in your own
shit -- so go talk to one of
these poor innocent schmuck
kids you can misquote and
destroy... Okay?!
(loud, walking away)
Hey, didn't we win! Didn't we
beat L.A.! Two in a row!
We're back!
The reporters are somewhat stunned by Tony's erratic
behavior.

INT. TUNNEL - TWILIGHT

Dr. Mandrake is exiting quickly, but Dr. Powers manages
to catch up to him.
POWERS
(to Mandrake)
... There's something wrong with
Shark.
MANDRAKE
Wow! Brilliant deduction! Did
you go to medical school for that?
POWERS
He's having trouble focusing. His
hand-eye coordination's deteriorating
and his memory, when I...?
MANDRAKE
He's fucked up! They're all
fucked up! Their job is getting
fucked up! The crazier they get,
the more the crowd likes them.

POWERS
(undeterred)
Harv, this is not professional
wrestling. He needs a head M.R.I.
and M.R.A.

Mandrake stops.
MANDRAKE
You're not even here six months,
Allie! You're gonna order a
20 thousand dollar test for every
nutcase on this team?
POWERS
He could have a subdural hematoma,
intracranial bleeding...
MANDRAKE
Or he just could be a crazy
fucker, okay! Listen, every
Sunday these guys walk out onto
that field, they only got one
thing and one thing alone going
for 'em -- their confidence!
(beat)
You start chipping away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary
testing and we can kiss the
playoffs good-bye.
POWERS
Who's 'we,' Harv?
MANDRAKE
'We'! The team! Heading into the
playoffs, you... you innocent!
Television income triples. Yes!
Bonuses! B.M.W.s! 'We,' -- the
team, what's wrong with that?!
Mandrake, agitated, resumes walking.

Powers follows.

POWERS
Are you saying I can't give Shark
the tests?
MANDRAKE
Jesus Christ!... I'll take care of
it, I'll get you the results!
(as Powers starts
to object)
I've earned their trust, Allie.
You haven't. Good night.

EXT. CALIFORNIA CRUSADERS STADIUM - TWILIGHT

Madman now walks out, wearing an upside-down jockstrap
around his forehead. The waiting fans and miscellaneous
REPORTERS love it, snapping pictures... Willie, following,
is surrounded and held back by a mob of fans and shouted
questions, requests, photographs (AD LIBS). He tries to
accommodate, but is overwhelmed.
TUNNEL REPORTER #1
Willie!... You got 100 yards
rushing today, how 'bout that?
WILLIE
(over the kids)
Ain't it amazing how fast a human
body can move when it's being
chased by 4.6 raptors who weigh
more'n my mama!
They're laughing.
TUNNEL REPORTER #2
Hey, Willie! What's it feel like
one day to be nobody, next day the
whole world knows you?
The question gives Willie pause. He fields it
gracefully.
WILLIE
I was always a star, you just
didn't know it. But who says it's
'the whole world'? -- How
important's football when two
billion Chinese never even heard
of it?
He has a natural charm and the press seems to like him
for now... Other players walk by, ignored -- Shark among
them, with Monroe, spotting Willie.
SHARK
Baby, the sharks are in the water.

MONTAGE #2 - WILLIE BEAMEN'S RISE

Set to a RAP SONG, "I'm Willie Beamen."

EXT. SOUTH BEACH - DAY

The Met-Rx image tied to Willie appears on the side of a
Miami bus as Willie exits a beautiful hotel, two babes in
tow, and enters his shiny new yellow Suburban, accompanied
by a new agent, Wayne Mercer. Pointing to the moving bus:

MERCER
Y'see, while you're sleeping I'm
working. There he goes! Bus
boy!... Creamin' Beamen!...

They can't help laughing at the hugeness of it all.

MONTAGE #2 - EXT. SOUTH BEACH - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

As the SONG CONTINUES, our players fool around at a touch
football game against a group of sexy beach girls.
Goofing off, Willie -- the cynosure of many eyes -suddenly pulls up, grimacing, his throwing shoulder
cramping on him. He conceals the pain and continues on.

MONTAGE #2 - INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - CONTINUOUS ACTIONDAY

MONTAGE - INT. CAP ROONEY'S HOUSE - GYM - CONTINUOUS
ACTION - NIGHT
In his state-of-the-art home gym, a sweating Cap Rooney
is going through an intense workout -- fly- motions and
windmills on a Swiss ball. A supervising, sleepy trainer
#3 reads a magazine in the corner, as Cindy Rooney enters
in a sexy nightgown.
CINDY
Yo, Rocky, enough! You're gonna
hurt yourself...
Cap ignores her.
CINDY
You're gonna hurt yourself...

Cap comes off the ball, checks his body fat and heart
rate on an intricate sports computer showing him at
7.5 percent body fat.
CAP

... kid's breathin' down my neck.
CINDY

He's not even close!

MONTAGE #2 - INT. MIAMI PRACTICE CENTER - GYM CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

Willie works out with a crew of powerful teammates...
Later, he is still there, alone. His eyes burn into the
wall-size mirrors with compulsive determination.

MONTAGE #2 - EXT. HOTEL SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS
ACTION - DAY

Willie now shoots a "Met-Rx" commercial. He's in a
bathing suit, body beautifully chiseled as girls by the
dozen surround him... singing his own rap song.
WILLIE
(song TBD)
'My name is Willie... Willie
Beamen... an' I keep the ladies
screamin', oh yeah!... creamin'
for my semen. Say hey, I'm
Willie Beamen! etc...
As the SONG and MONTAGE #2 END AT...

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD #2 (#2 OF 3) - DAY

Coach D'Amato and the QB Coach watch Willie and Rooney
throwing side-by-side. Cap is still feeling pain in his
lower back and legs; his passes are off, and he realizes
it; whereas Willie's passes are on the money, sometimes
too much so. One bullet pass bounces out of Sanderson's
gut, burning his fingers, cursing.

TONY
(to Willie)
... less on the ball, Willie! You
want a cool, tight spiral... and
don't pat the ball, you...
WILLIE
Tight as fish pussy, Coach.
the man'!

'I'm

TONY
'You're the man.' I repeat, don't
pat the ball so much. They can
see it!
(to QB Coach)
What'd he say?
WILLIE
Said I'm as tight-ass cool as the
other side of my pillow, Coach...
Tony shakes his head as Willie this time completes a
hard, precise spiral to his tight end.
TONY
(to QB Coach)
I need an interpreter... Awright,
Cap, sit it out.
I'm fine.

CAP
TONY
You got the balls, we all know
that -- now take a rest.
Rooney, pissed, moves to the sidelines, Tony, sensing his
unrest, follows... as Christina, keeping an eye on her new
star, arrives with Willie's agent in tow...
TONY
What do you want! You're off,
but...
CAP
Hey, I've been on for twelve years
and two rings, gimme a break.
I've played hurt before. No big
deal.
TONY
We're gonna go with Willie against
the Emperors...

CAP
Are you kidding me?! Are you...
(wants to swear)
kidding me -- ?
Rock...

TONY
CAP
I'm ready to play, Tony!
Goddamit!
TONY
Listen to me. I want you to rest
up until the playoffs. It doesn't
mean enough against the Emperors
for you to risk...
CAP
Home field advantage don't mean
enough? Since when...?
TONY
It's not the big one, Cap. We can
win at home or on the road with
you. You know it's the smart thing
to do. And one thing you always
were was smart, Cap -- smarter than
you were dumb.
CAP
Is this how it starts, Tony? I
know the way your mind works, man.
'Rest up.' Let the kid take a few
games. You were great, but time
marches on, huh?
TONY
That's not what I'm saying -CAP
The heck it's not!
game of football!

I know the

Cap walks away, crossing Willie on his way off the field.
He slaps the back of his helmet hard.
CAP
Get all pretty for the cameras,
poster boy!
What the -- ?!

WILLIE

CAP
... They love you today but a
season's 16 games, kid. It's how
you live through the bad ones
that makes you a quarterback,
not a punk!

INT. SHARK CENTER LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
Mandrake walks alongside Christina, through an empty
locker room.
MANDRAKE
... the bottom line is Rooney's
some kind of medical miracle. He
really could be ready for New York.
CHRISTINA
You told anyone, Harvey?
Mandrake, thinking she would be pleased, shakes his head,
realizes what she's really thinking.
MANDRAKE
... 'Course he'd have to take a
lot of pain and his ankle's not 100
percent. But he will. He's got
the mind of an ox. He's so
freaked about Beamen stealing his
job, he'd probably play with a
fractured neck.
CHRISTINA
Harvey... could you slow him down?
Tell him he's not responding to
rehab well enough -- just till
the playoffs. Give Beamen his
shot...?
MANDRAKE
(pause)
Well... everyone knows herniated
discs are 'iffy.' I could
recommend...
CHRISTINA
(moves on)
What about Shark?
MANDRAKE
He's still woozy, got bad
migraines. Post-concussive
syndrome.

CHRISTINA
Can you clear him?
MANDRAKE
(almost laughs)
... you mean which shell is the
real peanut under?
(hesitates)
Three concussions the last five
months? There's no way to predict
what another head-hit would do,
Christina...
CHRISTINA
How come Dallas had their
quarterback practically in a coma
last month just before he played
one of the greatest games of his
life...?
MANDRAKE
(backtracking)
... Well no question he wants his
tackle and sack bonus bad.
Theoretically, his brain's at
increased risk, but it's
theoretical, and I can pump him
full of cortisone to catch the
swelling and let him finish out
the season... without a
malpractice suit of course -(off her look)
I'm joking. I don't really think
anything's gonna happen... but I'm
not a complete prick, you know,
Christina, I do have some
kind of conscience.

EXAM ROOM #1

If she thinks so, Christina stays cool-eyed about it.
They enter a small exam room.
CHRISTINA
I'm not looking to screw him,
Harvey. But I gotta have him in
the playoffs -- and he wants to
play for chrissake, so everyone
comes out...
MANDRAKE
... long term?... What are you
thinking?

CHRISTINA
(a beat, eye to eye)
I'm thinking we'll probably cut
him in the off-season. The word's
already out there, everyone's seen
him take the hits. No one's
gonna take him at his price... I
think he'll be happy just to have
his old job back at 30 percent of
what he makes. That's if we want
him back.
(off Mandrake's
waiting look)
Dad always used to say, 'To make
money, you got to spend money.'
You do the math, Doctor. What you
help save us we won't forget at
contract time.
MANDRAKE
Smart man, Art. But you got him
beat by a Miami mile, Christina...
What do I tell Tony?
CHRISTINA
(exiting)
Tell him what he needs to know.
Shark can play. Cap can't.

INT. TONY D'AMATO'S HOUSE - LATE DAY/NIGHT

Tony's in his kitchen when the DOORBELL RINGS, laboring
over a pot of jambalaya, wearing an apron reading: "Kiss
My Chef." A BILLIE HOLIDAY RECORDING PLAYS. He goes.
AT FRONT DOOR
Willie waits, carrying flowers.
WILLIE
Hi, got you flowers.
He thrusts the flowers forward. Tony looks at them, a
little taken aback; then takes them and shows Willie into
the living room.

TONY
For me? Thanks... I guess I
better put these in water or
something. Come on in.

Tony goes to the kitchen, looking at the flowers.
now gets it.

Willie

WILLIE
(to himself)
Shark, you motherfucker!!
Sit down.
Nice place.

TONY
WILLIE
TONY
You wanna beer?
Sure.

WILLIE
TIME CUT TO:

SAME SCENE - LATER

Tony brings beers to Willie, glancing at Ben Hur on
television; the irony slave ships and gladiators is not
lost on Willie.
WILLIE
The gladiators of their time...
(to Tony)
Cute apron.
TONY
(removing it)
My ex-wife got it for me. It was
a joke. I don't cook so great -so don't expect anything too...
WILLIE
Don't worry. I'd be happy with a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
When'd you divorce her?

TONY
Almost twenty years now...
(off silence)
Same old story, she got fed up
with me working so hard. You know
where they served the divorce
papers? On the sidelines of the
divisional playoff game in New
York.
WILLIE
(chuckles)
That's cold.
TONY
Fuck her, we won the game.
WILLIE
That's what it's all about.
You ready?

TONY
Tony leads Willie into a dining room, Willie glancing
around, noting many football photos that grace the walls.
TIME CUT TO:

DINING ROOM

Tony and Willie eat from two steaming plates of jambalaya.
TONY
... my own recipe. Sort of
adapted from Paul Prudhomme's.
Ever been to his place in New
Orleans?

No.

WILLIE
(disguising his
distaste)
TONY
Maybe get 'em next season. Like
no place on earth, New Orleans.
How you like it?
Hot!

WILLIE
It's terrific, thanks.

TONY
... Well, thanks for coming by.

WILLIE
You're going to yell at me, aren't
you?
TONY
No... no. I just wanted to
talk...
(a beat)
Willie, look, if I've been an
asshole I'm sorry. Cap going down
was really tough for me and maybe
I've been taking some of that out
on you. I know you're still
learning the system and the
pressure's incredible -WILLIE
I can handle it.
TONY
I know. But we need to talk about
this. I think you got a great
future in football but first off
we gotta deal with some basics.
Like if the play book is too
complicated we can simplify it for
you -WILLIE
Man, that book is too slow. When
I am out there on the field I just
gotta feel it. I can't be
thinking about nothing but the
juice. I got to let it out.
TONY
Listen, you're too fast out there
as it is. You need to wait for
the plays to develop. Our offense
was built up over years, it's like
Chinese water torture, taking
apart the other team a little at a
time, it's the death of 1,000 cuts.
WILLIE
I like things I guess a little
more muscular, suits my style...
TONY
(stops eating)
Is that why you been changing the
plays?

WILLIE
I'm trying to read the defense,
Coach, it's...
TONY
I'm not talking about audibles...
Look, I know you like making the
big plays. I understand that.
But our game plans are the result
of a lot of work and a lot of
experience.
I know that --

WILLIE
TONY
I know you do. When you change
plays you're showing disrespect to
a lot of people in this
organization -WILLIE
I don't mean to -TONY
People who've worked for years in
this club and around the League.
People who've sacrificed more than
you will ever know to be in this
game.
Willie sees where this is going.
WILLIE
I'm trying to win, Coach! I been
warming the bench ever since I got
to the pros, and I don't plan on
going back there. I don't wanna
disrespect nobody but... winning
is the only thing I respect.
Tony looks at Willie with a singular, quiet intensity.
TONY
Okay, son, listen to me very
carefully and remember what I'm
going to tell you. You can forget
every other goddamn thing I ever
said if you remember this, because
someday you're going to realize
it's the truest thing you ever
heard: This game has got to be
about more than winning.

Willie says nothing.
TONY
(relaxes a little)
... I guess that's what I wanted
to say. You're part of something
here! A tradition. Lombardi,
Unitas, Tittle, Sammy Baugh,
hundreds of great players! Those
men on the wall, you're part of
that now. And along the way I
want you to cherish that... 'cause
when it's gone, it's gone forever,
and...
WILLIE
You know, I look at all these
pictures and trophies and stuff
and it just makes me... sad. Like
the room is full of ghosts. When
I'm done with the game, or the
game is done with me, I don't
wanna be no ghost up on a wall. I
want more'n that.
Tony takes a long moment.
TONY
... Looks like Cap's gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs...
I'm gonna start him.
WILLIE
(long icy pause)
Yeah, I figgered. That's why I'm
here, right? I knew you was gonna
sell me out.
TONY
Cap's a leader... a team player.
You need a team to win in the
playoffs.
WILLIE
Bullshit! He's not half the
athlete I am! Look me in the eye,
Coach, and tell me Cap's the
better player...
TONY
Cap's the better player.

WILLIE
(derisively)
Sure! I guess that was another
guy winning the last two games. I
put points on the board! He lost
four in a row. I lead by doing!
TONY
You kicked ass, kid, but Cap
Rooney has been 'doing' it for
years and he goddamn deserves his
day in the sun, so don't start...
WILLIE
And I deserve the bench, right?!
TONY
... He's been the quarterback of
this team as long as...
WILLIE
And his time is over! And yours
is too... 'less you start taking
some risks! Start playing the
game the way it is now. It ain't
all those pictures on the wall
anymore -TONY
(seething)
I've lived this game for three
decades, kid, I know football.
Those men -WILLIE
Wanted to win -- just like you do!
You can feed the press and the fans
all that 'sacrifice and glory,
grand ol' man of the game' crap!
You sell it good, everyone bought it.
But I been there, Coach, I seen a
long line of guys like you from
college on with that bullshit
halftime speech!
TONY
(furious)
It's bullshit, huh!
you...

You think

WILLIE
Yeah, it is! And you know it is!
'Cause it's really about money.
Rakin' in the TV contracts, fatcat boosters sittin' in their
skyboxes and coaches uppin' their
salaries, all of 'em looking for
the next black stud to get 'em in
the Top Ten, put 'em in the bowl
games -- It's just like the pros,
'cept in the pros, the field hands
get paid...
TONY
Don't play the race card with me,
kid. Twenty-five years I've worked
with men of your color. You're
good because you're different, not
because...
WILLIE
Maybe it's not racism, maybe it's
placism, but the black man still
gotta know his place, right, Coach?
TONY
What are you saying? You don't
trust anybody 'cause of what
happened to you in college? You
knew the rules, Willie, you broke
'em.
Broke 'em?!

WILLIE
How'd I break 'em?

You broke 'em.
broke, 'em.

TONY
That's how you

WILLIE
Man, I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus 'cause a booster
gave me a three-hundred-dollar
suit to go to his kid's wedding.
I didn't even know the guy.
Hell, everybody was getting
something! How's a black man
supposed to get through college
when he don't got the money to get
clothes, go on a date? They all
had their hands out but it was me
they suspended.
(MORE)

WILLIE (CONT'D)
I dropped six rounds in the draft
'cause of that. And the coaches
rapping me 'troublemaker,' 'arrogant,'
'won't play ball,' all that corporate
shit they hit the brothers with
when they won't kiss the money.
Shit, I coulda made millions
of dollars if I'd kissed that big
ass Julian's kissing all the time.
You talk about 'sacrifice'? I
sacrificed about ten million dollars
is what I sacrificed, 'cause of
those dumb rednecks like your
coach friend at San Diego who
makes me corner back 'cause I got
fast feet! It was him separated
my shoulder, fucked up my throwin'
arm tackling some 250-pound
bullmother. I was a great football
player but nobody gave me the time
of day or the season I needed
to heal that shoulder. They
traded me right outta there!
TONY
Blame anybody but yourself,
Willie! Y'see, that's what a
leader is about, the times he's
gotta sacrifice because he has to
lead by example, not by fear or...
WILLIE
(challenged)
Fear?! Who you talking to?! I
hung in there when nobody gave a
shit about me. I rode the bench
for five fucking years! And now I
get my one lousy shot, I'm 26
years old -- half my football life
is over -- and now you tell me
'You go on back to the bench, son.
'Cause you gotta sacrifice for
the greater glory of Cap Rooney.'
Well, fuck you, Coach! I'm not
buying that brand, 'cause you're
some scared old man who won't let
me play my way 'cause I might just
win! And then what the fuck was
your life all about?!
Tony fights to control himself.
crawls through the twilight.

Outside, the evening

TONY
(quietly)
You're not some flash-in-the-pan
receiver or corner back or even Julian
Washington, kid, you're a goddamn
quarterback! You know what that
means? It's the top spot, kid,
the guy that takes the fall, the
guy who everybody's looking at
first, the leader of a team, who
will break their ribs and noses
and necks for you 'cause they
believe! 'Cause you make 'em
believe! That's a quarterback.
WILLIE
(caustic,
overlapping)
Yeah, I'm the leader of your team
till Cap's back up! Then I'm back
on the bench. Shit, you ain't said
two words to me all season 'til
Cherubini went down -- then it
was...
(imitating D'Amato)
'Son, just pretend you're throwing
a pass on the street in the 'hood
and your mama's ringing the dinner
bell' -- all you done is talked at
me, man, never listened to a
goddamned thing I said! So don't
have no coronary 'cause I'm gonna
stay who I am -- 'Steamin' Willie
Beamen'! 'Cause with the time I
got left I'm gonna play my way and
I'm gonna get my dollars up there
so's when you motherfuckers trade
me, waive me, injure reserve me,
or whatever the fuck you do to me,
I'm gonna be worth ten times what
I was worth before!
A long pause. Tony's eyes, moving past ego, scrambling
to understand.
TONY
I don't know... you are a very,
very young man. And you are very,
very stupid.
WILLIE
Tell me I'm wrong.

TONY
You're wrong. I know better than
you think, Willie...
WILLIE
You don't know one thing about
me... You couldn't even begin to
imagine me.
He leaves Tony -- drained.

EXT. SHARK'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Valet parkers attend to the numerous expensive cars and
limos that pull into a circular driveway, unloading
beautiful laughing women and exuberant football players...
Willie drives his Suburban right up onto the front lawn,
enraging the valets.

INT. SHARK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

Willie is met with a ferocious explosion of MUSIC and
mayhem; players dance and drink and pursue the opposite
sex through the house... Shark bounces up to him:
SHARK
Make yourself at home in 'The
Pit,' Dawg! Blowjobs upstairs.
But if you want to hit the skins,
trawl the beach. Whatever you do,
don't mess up my sheets, cause my
old lady's comin' back Tuesday and
she gonna kick my butt she see any
semen or blood round here!!
In a lively mood, Shark stumbles off. Willie makes his
way through a packed living room... women immediately
perk when they see him, whispering, some predatory...

INT. SHARK'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
ACTION
Willie gravitates to Washington, Sanderson, a few others:
The dialogue is fast, overlapping.
SANDERSON
What up, Willie B?! Coach give
you the Vince Lombardi speech?

WILLIE
He's in my face like I lost the
goddamn game! Mother...
SANDERSON
Told you! Hey, he's having a shit
year, what do you...
WILLIE
You know straight up we'd be top
dog this season if the defense
would step up -WASHINGTON
Hey, lay off the D, man. Shark
hear that shit he'll tear you a
new asshole.
WILLIE
You think I give a fuck! Hey, I
wanna win games, not kiss some
overrated loser's ass. But what
do you care anyway, J? You ain't
playin' for this team. You
playing for yourself, like
everybody else round here...
WASHINGTON
Who you talking about, punk?!
Watch that mouth of yours or I'll
kick your fucking ass! You gotta
earn the right to diss someone on
this team, boy!
WILLIE
Team? Shit. All I see of this
team is a bunch of rich superfly
brothers tripping in this white
man's world, driving their BMW,
getting their dicks sucked by
100 dollar hair jobs... and the
clock's running and no one's
giving a shit 'cause they're
all dying inside... You were a
great athlete, J, but you become
a joke! You're playing, but it's
like you're dying inside.

Willie walks off -- his thoughts contradicting what he
said at Tony's place; a troubled man, his confusion
brewing to the surface. Julian, on the other hand, is a
furious man, restrained by Sanderson and the others.

WASHINGTON
What the fuck you mean 'dying
inside'?! Kiss my Armani ass,
m'fucker! Talking to me like
that! Who the... does this nigra
know WHO I AM?! What I done for
this team?! I'm gonna kill you,
motherfucker!

EXT. SHARK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
In the hot tub, players are cavorting with the women, and
Shark is telling stories, as Powers listens in.
SHARK
... So then Madman loses it -starts reaming this guy out and
then decides this hotel has GOT TO
DIE! Stomps into the hall, grabs
a fire ax and starts chopping
through the wall. By now Styne,
he grabs him, he's about to
eliminate Madman right then and
there, so I gotta jump in, I got
to protect my baby, be the hero
and save the fuckin' guy, when
whap! thwack! Styne throws two
quick punches that weigh about
150 pounds each and nails me right
in the fucking head! Cracks my
fucking skull! Check it out...
(indicates his temple
area)
... Bitch! From then on, guess
what? Styne and Madman are like
this dynamic evil duo who...
POWERS
(interrupting)
He cracked your skull?
SHARK
Yeah. So those two sonofabitches
decide they're gonna rule the
world...
POWERS
Hold on, Shark. He actually
cracked your skull?

SHARK
Yeah, Doc. I hate when that shit
happens... So now we got these two
locos on the offensive line and
Coach D'Amato is about ready to
call an exorcist when...

Dr. Powers, disturbed, leaves without being noticed.

INT. SHARK'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME TIME

A dozen beauties are lined up at the giant mirror, making
themselves up, "doing blow," chatting, gossiping...

EXT. SHARK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD

Julian, still angry, slides up to Shark.
WASHINGTON
Beamen disrespecting you, talking
shit about you and the D...
SHARK
Are you kidding me? Are you
fucking kidding me?! He goes
after my D, I'm gonna break him
off!
WASHINGTON
Motherfucker punkin' every damn
one of us. We need to smack the
m'fucker!
Shark thinks a beat, then:
SHARK
What's that motherfucker drive?

INT. SHARK'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BALCONY

RAY FIELDS, former star linebacker, now using a set of
canes, approaches, Crozier, talking to Willie. Fields'
wizened face and eyes are a little too desperate for
attention.

Hey, Nick.

FIELDS
How's it hanging?

CROZIER
Young and hung, Ray.
FIELDS
Steamin'! My man -- lookin' good.
Does my heart proud to see a young
brother in the pocket.
WILLIE
(interrupted, doesn't
know him)
Havin' fun, baby.
FIELDS
(checking out Willie's
chick)
Yeah, yeah, havin' fun. I hear
ya. Say, Nick, I was meaning to
talk to you 'bout some new plays
I got -Not now, Ray.
okay?

CROZIER
It's party time,

Willie notices the dominant Pantheon Cup ring on Fields'
hand.
FIELDS
Yeah, yeah -- party time, uh huh
-- not the right time...
(catching Willie's
eye)
Yeah, Pantheon Cup twice -- '79,
Fields emits a strange, oxen-like laughter -- they split
looks, Willie horrified; Fields knows it, refers to his
emaciated fingers.
FIELDS
Gotta get a chain for this one,
try to buy 'em off me all the
time. Had to sell one of 'em, but
no way I was gonna let this sucker
go. Without this, shit! You
wouldn't even know who the fuck I
was, now would you? I been
there, Willie. Done that. You
'steamin'' now but this is one
dance they all play the same last
song...

CROZIER
Hey, Ray, give it a rest, willya
-- enjoy the party. It's his
time... You had your time, it's
his time.
FIELDS
Sure, Nick, but you a coach -(pointed)
If you ain't helping him, you're
hurtin' him...
(to Willie)
Don't bull with the shit,
righteous, there's plenty of it.
(again that humongous
laughter)
Ha ha ha ha!
(high fives)
Stay cool, little brother...
WILLIE
(gives it back)
You too, Ray...
His eyes burning like candles, Ray shifts his intense,
almost blind gaze off Willie, and staggers back into the
chaos of MUSIC and flesh on his canes.
WILLIE
That really Ray Fields?
CROZIER
Used to be Ray Fields.
WILLIE
Man! I watched him on TV growing
up. Every Sunday. Like Tarzan.
He was huge!
CROZIER
Yeah. Like he said, he was just too
long at the dance. Like the rest of
'em... Thank God, those days are
over...
WILLIE
He give you plays?
CROZIER
(shrugs, dismissive)
... I humor him. Gives him
something to do.
(MORE)

CROZIER (CONT'D)
Guy took a lotta hits -- lost
everything to booze, painkillers -his family, all his money, typical
shit... was out on the street for a
while, then the press got hold of
it and management gave him a few
bucks. He gets by... Don't get down,
Willie... I'm pushing real hard
for another OT or pulling guard in
the draft.
Moved, Willie's eyes remain on Fields, talking to someone
else; he's also rethinking Crozier's attitude towards the
players.
WILLIE
I like it, sounds like some big
changes coming next year, Coach.
Maybe you be stepping up...
Washington strolls up to him.
WASHINGTON
Say, Willie, that your 4 X 4
outside?
WILLIE
You mean my Sub? What's up?
WASHINGTON
Well, it's more like a 4 X 3 now.
Smiling, he strolls back out the front door.
Willie follows fast.

A beat.

EXT. SHARK'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A LOUD, GRINDING, BUZZING sound.
assembled.

Partygoers are

Shark bestrides Willie's Suburban with an enormous
CHAIN SAW in his hands, literally SAWING the VEHICLE in
two halves. Sparks shoot out, upholstery, plastic, and
metal fly... Willie can't believe, then rushes Shark,
wanting to kill him! (AD LIBS)... but others jump him;
it takes several strong players to restrain him.
The car now tears open at a jagged angle. Shark TURNS
OFF the CHAIN SAW, removes his safety goggles... to
Willie:

SHARK
Kid, in football you got an
offense...
(jumping down, points
to the severed front
of the car)
And you got a defense...
(indicates the back
half)
You don't got one without the
other, do you...? Respect will be
paid. Now call this m'fucker a
cab and get him the fuck outta my
house!

Monroe

TONY
... I just can't get through.
Used to be I could take anyone -rookie, vet, bad-ass parolee -didn't matter -- I could make
them... see what I see.
MONROE
(more revealing than
usual)
It's a new world, Tony! In my day
we were just happy to have the
goddamned job. I shoveled liquor
in the off-season, used cars,
insurance. Some guys used to
wrassle... Now, shit -- Prima
dawgs! Bodies are year-round
great but break like china!
Mandy, the young beautiful woman who approached Tony
previously, enters with a friend. Tony notices, as does
Monty.
TONY
TV... It changed the way we think
-- forever. First time they
stopped the game because they had
to cut to a commercial was the end
of it. I mean it was our
concentration that fucking
mattered, not some fruitcake
selling insurance...

MONROE
... Getting those big salaries,
the bonuses, these rooks come in
here thinking they deserve respect
before they play a goddamn down -TONY
(passionate)
Damnit, Monty, I don't know what
more I can do. I've sweated blood
for these men. I've given up my
wife and my children for these men.
I've given up everything I have
to be on that sideline every Sunday.
Everything! The game is all that
matters to me. 'Cause it's pure!
Four quarters. You cross a line,
you score. It's sane. Life
isn't, it isn't... It doesn't make
sense for me not to have a home, a
life... you tolerate the madness for
the game... but if that's not enough,
then this game is asking for too
goddamn much!
MONROE
It always did, Tony... I coulda
held on another two, three seasons.
But one day in Chicago, the wind
was blowin' off the lake -- man was
it cold! I cracked my head right
up against that frozen turf, and I
knew -- right then -- I wasn't gonna
do this anymore.. shit, it wasn't
any fucking fun! -- You gotta know
when to get out, Tony. 'Fore it
takes your soul.

Willie's commercial explodes over the bar, with LOUD
MUSIC -- stylish, slick, sexy.

Curfew! How the hell do you and

MONROE
Well, we came to an agreement
early on. All day long I live,

moment I come home, I live,
breathe, and shit family.
TONY

... It's impossible!
MONROE

Hey, who the hell wants to think
about blitzes and crossblocks when
you're holding your grandkids in
your arms...?
(pointed)
You gonna miss your boss
embarrassing you in front of your
players?
(as Tony doesn't
acknowledge this
memory)
That's why I want to coach high
school, it's back to basics, the
kids don't want nothing but to play.
Like you say, it's pure... See you

Tony sits for a moment, and then glances at

INT. TONY D'AMATO'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tony gazes at one of three wall TV's; Mandy on an
exercise bike in the corner, semi-naked in his pajamas.

TONY
... So Jeanette was 20, 21, I was
just making it as a lowball
assistant with San Diego -- Jock
Harris was running the place then
-- and one day we been romancing a
year about and I says to her, 'So
what about marriage?' And she
says, 'What about it?' And I says
to her, 'Well, I gotta see you
backpedal first.' And she says...
Backpedal?

MANDY
TONY
You know. Quarterback gotta be
able to drop back -- ? Run
backwards? You shoulda seen
Jeanette's face. She gets up -bless her Albanian soul! And she
does it! She backpedals for me.
In high beautiful heels too! All
the way! Jeanette! Can you do
it? Don't try -- I'll marry ya!
MANDY
(crossing to bed)
Your genes, her genes... did
you get a quarterback out of it?
TONY
Nah. Not even close. I had an
insurance executive.
(as they both laugh)
How can you have one of them?
Came out with a briefcase.
(beat)
... Nah, he's a beautiful kid.
MANDY
(props herself
over Tony)
You know what you need?
TONY
... yeah, a pump.
MANDY
You need to be... young again!
She attacks him, tickling him all over. Like a boy,
Tony giggles; it's been a long time since he'd been
tickled.
INTERCUT WITH:

ON TV

Willie, wearing gold chains and a new diamond stud
earring, is being interviewed by Jack Rose on "Sports
Corner."
WILLIE (V.O.)
(on TV)
... The coach in Houston didn't
dig black quarterbacks too much,
he was kind of a redneck dude...
(laughs)
Thought black people's brains were
about the size of his dick (bleeped)...
Then at San Diego -- that coach was
a real genius -- he makes me into a
corner 'cause he says I got fast
feet...
(a bitter edge to his
laughter)
Then I got injured and that
screwed up that year. By the time
I got to Oakland my third year,
they didn't know what the fuck
(bleeped) I was!
ROSE (V.O.)
(on TV)
Sounds like 'a conspiracy,'
Willie! Are you saying black
people are being dissed here?
WILLIE (V.O.)
(shakes his head)
'Conspiracy'?
(laughs)
Man, you is media-believing. Just
let the facts speak for
themselves, Jack -- 70 percent of
the League is Afro-American and
how many black head coaches? A
few. How many black owners?
Zero. You do the math, my man...
But I ain't bitchin'. Fair's not
what I'm looking for. 'Cause
nothing's 'fair' in this here
life.
ROSE (V.O.)
Come on, kid! It's a free country!
Black dudes can buy teams. You
have the green, you can buy a team.
Black, white, or inbetween.

WILLIE (V.O.)
Football teams are corporations,
Jack, but black kids are raised to
be individuals, stars -- they
don't learn to work together...

BACK TO SCENE

Tony, made happy by Mandy, gets out of bed, puts a robe
on with his name emblazoned, like a fighter's, on the
back, about to turn off the TV.
Leave him on.

MANDY
He's cool.

TONY
(mocking)
'Cool'? My quarterback? He
thinks he's Joe Montana already.
MANDY
I like him. He doesn't buy into
the bullshit... I like his eyes.
He's sure of himself -- makes him
sexy.
Tony looks at Willie, wondering. Being with someone as
young as Mandy permits him to understand. He pulls a
blank check from his robe.
TONY
Thank God I'm old. Check alright?
MANDY
(laughs)
Is it good? Prefer credit card or
cash, but this one time -- okay...
TONY
(filing it out)
You want a nightcap or something?
MANDY
(starting to dress)
No, I don't think so, but
thanks...
TONY
How 'bout some coffee then?...
Just stay for some coffee. Five
minutes.

Okay.

MANDY
(senses his need)
Coffee'd be great.

He goes as she continues to dress, watching.
WILLIE (V.O.)
... I like looking downfield, Jack.
I'm a big play guy. That's what
the fans want. Sometimes the
old timers like 'Coach Stone Age,'
they don't go for that, but the
scoreboard don't lie, Jack...
ROSE (V.O.)
'Coach Stone Age'?, that's
terrific!
WILLIE (V.O.)
That's my little nickname. Don't
mean no disrespect to the man, but
to me it's all about winning.
That's what this country's all
about. Being number one. Every
kid can grow up to be President,
right? Who the hell wants to grow
up to be Vice-President? There
ain't no number two in football.
You tell me who lost the Pantheon
Cup last year? You tell me who
came in second in the 100 at the
Olympics? Where I come from
you're number one or you ain't
shit (bleeped)! This country was
built on kicking immigrant ass.
African ass, Chinese ass -- don'tmatter-who ass. Only reason I made
it out of Dallas is I wanted it
more than the other guy. There
ain't no grey area! Either you
make it and get the big car and the
nice home or you're on the bus and
in the funeral home, 'cause losin'
is dying!
ROSE (V.O.)
... But 'Coach Stone Age,' you
smack me! So truthful, brother...
Gimme a pound.
He tries to high five Willie, who doesn't respond...
Meanwhile, Tony crosses back with the coffee.

TONY'S BATHROOM #1

Mandy is on a cell phone to her service (AD LIB),
brushing her hair, closing the phone as Tony enters.
TONY
I hope you like cream with your
coffee... Mandy...? I like you.
I'm wondering if we could maybe
make this a more regular thing?
MANDY
Sure. I've got a few clients like
that. We can book a regular time.
I'll give you my service number
and they can set it up direct
with...
Writing...
TONY
I sort of meant... not like that.
Without money.
Oh, honey...
I know, but --

MANDY
TONY
MANDY
You don't really wanna do this.
TONY
I really like you.
MANDY
I like you too, Tony, but you
really don't want to do this.
A beat.

She gives him her business number in lipstick.
TONY
You got pretty hair, you know...

Tony lingers for a moment, then sets his coffee down and
leaves. Mandy watches after him in the mirror.
TONY'S BEDROOM #2
Tony crosses OUT past:

ON TV
ROSE (V.O.)
No doubt you're chewing up the
gridiron, but on the sidelines it
seems like you and Julian
Washington got pretty heated
during the Texas game?
WILLIE (V.O.)
No, J-man and me are just fine.
I'll bet you a hundred bucks and
that ugly tie that he'll have
another 2,000-yard season.
INTERCUT WITH:

EXT./INT. JULIAN WASHINGTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sanderson talks on a cell phone, feeding the numerous
sharks in J-Man's specially-designed pools, as he heads
inside, accompanied by a frightened beauty... At the
party, there are no men -- only some 20 beautiful women,
most in lingerie, dancing and making out among themselves.

INT. JULIAN'S BEDROOM - FOLLOWING
Upstairs, at the controls is Julian, propped on his bed,
with several more girls, watching Willie on TV coolly.
WASHINGTON
Not without getting the ball, you
lying prick!
INTERCUT WITH:
ON TV
ROSE (V.O.)
... But isn't this an awesome
Emperor pass rush coming up Sunday?
I mean these guys don't need much
of an invitation to eat the
greenery? Is there fear there?
WILLIE (V.O.)
Jack, I told you, they ain't gonna
touch me, ain't gonna see me,
ain't gonna smell me. Don't
matter if it's T-Rex or Terminator
out there, I'll just turn on the
invisible juice and steam right by
'em!

INT. MADMAN'S HOUSE - FOLLOWING

ROSE (V.O.)
Willie, you are indefatigable!
Madman, on his cell phone, is heated as he watches the
TV, amid an atmosphere of CRYING BABIES, BARKING
PIT BULLS, and a pregnant, miserable wife.
MADMAN
You selfish asshole! If you don't
think you're gonna get touched,
I'm dancin' on a moonbeam!

INT. TV STUDIO - FOLLOWING

ROSE
(in closing)
... Well good luck to you,
'Steamin' Willie Beamen' -- what a
great young kid!

EXT. SHARK STADIUM - NIGHT (RAIN)
(Game 4.

New York Emperors at Miami Sharks.)

FIELD #1
Willie goes smashing into the mud, taking the hit on his
throwing shoulder. A painful sack, he drags himself up...
Dazed, Willie goes after the linebacker who nailed him...
The 49er players sprint over to protect their teammate,
but the Shark team does nothing to help their QB.
TUG (V.O.)
Welcome back to the Monsoon Bowl,
folks! The Emperors have been
eating Shark patties all night
long. Smashmouth football -- this
is what it's all about!
On the way to the huddle, over the DRIVING sound of RAIN.
WILLIE
Can I get some fuckin' protection
here! If you're not going to
block -- could you at least stay
the fuck out of my way?!
Madman goes for him, Sanderson and the others holding him
back.

MADMAN
Loudmouth, showboating,
MOTHERFUCKER! Where's your steam
now?

SCOREBOARD #1
EMPERORS 25, SHARKS 7.

FOURTH QUARTER.

5:13...

SIDELINE #1

Coach D'Amato glares at the field, the rain pouring over
his face.
TONY
(to line coach)
Get 'em to stand up and block,
goddamnit, Hank! What's going
on?!
TIME CUT TO:

FIELD #2

As the Emperor offense sets up, Shark urgently calls for
a defensive realignment -- Miami players hustle for new
positions -- the veteran Emperor QB sees this and quickly
barks out an audible -A quick handoff -- the Emperor running back shoots
through a hole in the confused Miami defense -- Shark
tries to make the diving tackle but his knee gives and
he goes facedown in the mud, as the running back
splashes right past him for 25 yards. Touchdown!
TUG (V.O.)
What is with the Miami D of late?
They are going belly up, fins
flapping. Glug-glug-glug!
BRANSON (V.O.)
Shark Lavay just can't find the
old magic down there.
The running back turns back to the downed Shark and his
D, and points his fingers like a gun -- Bang! Bang!
Bang! The trainer and doctors run out to Shark,
grabbing his knee in fierce pain.

SCOREBOARD #2

EMPERORS 32, SHARKS 7.

FOURTH QUARTER.

1:33...

HUDDLE #1

Willie, reading a signal from Cherubini on the
sideline, takes the team on with a dead stare.
WILLIE
Y'all want to make it tough okay,
I can take it, m'fucker! 'Cause I
know come contract time there
gonna be some big changes round
here -- and, baby, it's either
gonna be you or me! The call is
Twins Right 90 Ringo Slide. On
one! Ready!

FIELD #3

Set!

WILLIE
(yelling over the RAIN)
Black 671, Black 671! Hut!

Willie splashes back through the mud to pass -- an
Emperor defensive end slips through full speed -- Willie
is blindsided, his helmet goes flying off, he crashes to
the turf, his face slammed once more into the mud.

SIDELINE #2

D'Amato is wholly demoralized, can't look... Neither can
Cap Rooney, now in uniform, recognizing something he'd
rather not. Or something he'd perhaps forgotten -- the
sheer, frightening violence and impossibility of the QB
position.
CAP
They won't play for him, Tony.
Tony looks at him, frustrated.
TONY
(walks away)
Then let him fucking learn!

OWNER'S BOX #2

The visiting Mayor Smalls shares his feelings with
Christina.

MAYOR SMALLS
Shucks! There goes that black
dynasty you been promising me,
darling...

FIELD #4

Blood seeps down Willie's face from a scalp contusion as
he pulls himself slowly to his feet.
BRANSON (V.O.)
... And there goes home field
advantage for the Sharks!
Although their season ends on a
low note, there is still life
after death. Two weeks from now,
look for the underdog Sharks in
the playoffs in 'Toughtown U.S.A.'
-- Dallas, Texas -- football
capital of the world -- on that
fast astroturf that never forgets
to break a bone or two!

INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

The locker room is silent and depressed as players
undress and shower.
BATHROOM/SHOWER #1
Willie, dazed and steaming with anger, crosses Shark.
You lead.
nigga?

SHARK
But did anyone follow,

Willie ignores him, but not Julian on his other side,
when:
WASHINGTON
Whatsa matter, boy -- forgot your
'invisible juice'?
Willie explodes, takes a wild swing at the big man.
They struggle. They slip... players pull them apart,
Willie bleeding.
Tony storms into the shower with Monroe, sizes up the
situation.

All right!

Players freeze.

TONY
Stop this now!

Stop it!

Showers continue to run.

TONY
This kind of bush league crap
doesn't cut it with me! Anybody
who thinks otherwise can pack
their bags right now! 'Cause this
shit is never gonna happen again!
Ever! Is that clear...? You
don't do that out there! Men get
killed out there!
(pause)
... Thirty years in football, I
never seen something that stinks
like this! This is a violation!
... Today -- out there, you
embarrassed yourselves and you
embarrassed me. Today I am
ashamed to be your coach!
He stalks out.

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD #1 (3 OF 3) - DAY

Unnaturally bright lights are on Willie and Cap Rooney in
pads, side-by-side. They wear TV smiles, surrounded by a
gang of children in Shark jerseys. Willie's cheek is
stitched.
CAP
... So please give generously to
your Child Fund of America.
WILLIE
... And let's make every kid feel
like a superstar!
CAP
Because giving -- like football -is a team sport. Thank you.
They smile.

And smile.

Finally:

VOICE (O.S.)
That's a wrap, thanks, guys.
Rooney and Willie split in different directions... we
PULL BACK to reveal a small TV crew shooting a public
service commercial. Christina talks with the Sharks' PR
director and a TV producer.

Julian Washington watches the shoot from the bleachers,
brooding, upstaged by Beamen.
The children from the commercial follow Willie for
autographs. Willie's agent notes this to Christina
as they leave.
Rooney crosses to Cindy.
CINDY
You should've fought for that
superstar line.
CAP
No -- 'giving' -- 'team sport' -those are the lines.
CINDY
(noting the kids
around Willie)
Meanwhile... You used to do this
spot alone.
CAP
(uncomfortable)
Okay... you finished?
Walks away.
In the bleachers with the rest of the media, Jack Rose
observes with his two-man TV crew.
Julian studies the kids, who seem to adore Willie.
OLDER KID, 11 years old, intersects.
KID #1
Hey, J-man! Is it true you making
10 million a year?
(as J-man smiles,
nods)
... That true then 'bout you not
blocking no more? It's part of
your contract? That's what my Dad
says. He says you don't have to
catch no passes over the middle
either 'cause you don't want to get
hurt? It's also in your contract...
Right, J?
WASHINGTON
(a look)
... Yeah, your dad's got it down,
kiddo...

An

INT. SHARK CENTER - D'AMATO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
ACTION - DAY
Tony sits with Dr. Powers, Monroe and Shark Lavay -- his
MRI's spread on Tony's desk, the mood glum.
TONY
... So what are the odds?
POWERS
There's no telling. It's an
'odontoid fracture'...
(off their looks)
Basically, he broke his neck and
it never healed right. Coming
after the 20 to 30 concussions he's
had over 14 years, you can't predict
this type of thing, but I can say
this: the wrong hit could result
in paralysis, Parkinson's... even
sudden death.
SHARK
Hey, what else is new...?
POWERS
In my opinion, he shouldn't be
out there...
(pointed at Shark)
You could be braindead, your
speech slurred or you could have
weird personality changes for the
rest of your life... you
understand what I'm telling you,
Luther?
SHARK
(offset by his
sanctimony)
Luther do, but 'Shark' don't, Doc!
I been playing with fire since you
was shitting in your diapers, and
right now I need one sack and
three more tackles and I get my
bonus. Then we'll talk, okay,
motherfucker!
MONROE
(to Shark)
Y'ever seen an old punchdrunk
boxer, stumbling around and
drooling -- no memory of what he
done in his lifetime... you want
that life, Luther?

Shark looks from Monty to Tony, who is conflicted, holding
his feelings close.
TONY
I can't make this decision for
you, Shark.
SHARK
I don't believe this... You need me
against Texas, Coach?
TONY
(pause)
'Course I do, Shark, but no, not at
this price... no.
SHARK
(pleading to play)
Look, you goddamn know well as me
she gonna cut my ass anyhow in the
off-season! And no one's gonna
pick me up for any kinda money.
I'll be back here begging to
play for field wages, Coach...
Tony doesn't deny it, silent.
SHARK
I gave you 13 years of my best,
Coach, you know you owe me...
For a million bucks, shit! I'll
shake like a coconut tree the
rest of my life if I got to...
just lemme play... please?
TONY
(pause)
You'll have to sign a waiver, Shark.
SHARK
(relieved)
Bring it on...
Monroe shakes his head, disappointed.
with Shark:

As he goes out

POWERS
(to Tony)
We need to talk about Harvey,
Coach...
He pulls out an envelope with X-rays.

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD #2 (3 OF 3) - CONTINUOUS ACTION DAY
Mandrake's on a cell phone on the sidelines with his new
girl friend COURTNEY, when Tony walks up on him, furious,
followed by Powers. Christina has long left the practice
field.
MANDRAKE
(into phone)
... honey, don't believe a word
your mother says... don't ever say
your Pappa didn't believe in you -Me too. I...
TONY
You evil motherfucker -- !
MANDRAKE
Tony, what are you...?
(to daughter)
I'll call you later, princess.
Tony pulls him out of ear-shot.
TONY
Shark's film! I know what you
pulled, switching the results so
Powers wouldn't pick up on it!
MANDRAKE
(realizing)
... Granted. It could look like
that to a lay person, but to be
honest, Tony...
TONY
I want you outta here.
Now.

Today.

MANDRAKE
Oh, I see -- you're taking the
high road! Who's bullshitting
who here, Tony?
TONY
Did you bother consulting him!
He could get killed out there!
MANDRAKE
(overlapping)
I knew his answer!... And getting
killed? Maybe, maybe not! It's
one chance in a thousand, 'but
nobody blitzes like the Shark,'
right, Tony?

TONY
You walk off this field and you
get into your car and you go far
away -- I never want to see you
near one of my players again. Do
you understand me? Never.
MANDRAKE
Come on, Tony, most of them
couldn't piss in the morning
without pills.
No more -- !

TONY
MANDRAKE
So now you're gonna play
innocent?! You know something -fuck your innocence!
This explosion draws looks from the team. Jack Rose
tries to move closer to hear, but is blocked by Monroe.
MANDRAKE
You're better than me all of a
sudden?! You're better than
me?! What about Beyer?!
What about Nielstrum and Manzicki...
and Logan... and Krause?! All
these years you been turning a
blind eye!
TONY
I will not have this discussion.
Get out!
MANDRAKE
Sure, Tony, don't ask the question
if you don't want the answer, right?
Mandrake glares at Powers.
MANDRAKE
... And you, you fucking snitch!
Did you ever think about him
putting food on the table? Or
his kids going to college?
POWERS
You lied to me!

MANDRAKE
(mocking)
Oooh, I lied! The President lies
all the time, Allie!
POWERS
... and you lied to the players,
and doping them, changing X-rays
and -MANDRAKE
And making them heroes! That's
what I been doing. Who am I to
tell these men they can't live
their dream? These are big boys.
This is triage out there, asshole!
Let the man die a goddamn hero if
he wants.
POWERS
Oh, Christ! You didn't give him a
choice, Harvey, you gotta give him
his choice. It's a doctor's
ethics.
Since when?

MANDRAKE
POWERS
The Hippocratic Oath, that's
when...
MANDRAKE
You mean the one that starts: Do
no harm...? With all due respect,
I didn't have to ask him. I knew
his choice. Was there any doubt
whatever what this man must do?
These players are freaks of nature
-- they will not live with shame
like you. These men are
gladiators, warriors! And long
ago they made that choice, not me.
Or you! And I'm not taking that
responsibility of standing between
them and...
(switching the
approach)
Did you ever have a fucking dream,
Allie?
POWER
(a beat)
... I'm living it, Harvey.

TONY
(quietly)
This I mean -- get out.
Mandrake is genuinely sad to leave; he looks at Tony, not
without affection.
MANDRAKE
(quietly)
... Oh fuck it! But hey, we won
the Pantheon didn't we, Tony? See
you around the nursing homes...
(to his girl friend
watching)
Come on, sweetie.
COURTNEY
No, I wanna stay, Harvey... Please.
Dr. Harvey Mandrake smoothes out his expensive jacket and
walks away with some dignity, leaving Courtney behind.

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD #3 (3 OF 3)

Tony heads back to his office, unfortunately intersecting
Jack Rose with his crew, and several other reporters.
ROSE
So, Coach D., what's up now -mutiny in the medical ranks?
TONY
(blind and sudden)
Get the hell out of my way, you
piece of...!!
He shoves Rose out of his way and storms past. Rose slips
into the dugout, smacking his head on the bench. Tony
doesn't turn around, but everyone else tenses, expecting
trouble.
ROSE
Hey!... Hey!... That's just
great!...
(to his crew)
Did you get that!?

HUDDLE #2

Cap Rooney claps his hands, breaking the spell. Madman
and Sanderson have been watching this, worried and
confused, their doctor suddenly exiled from their lives.

CAP
Awright, guys, wake up!

PRACTICE FIELD #4 (3 OF 3)

They move to the ball. The team is running light contact
scrimmages, Crozier supervising on the sideline... Rooney
scans the defense.
Blue 44.

CAP
Blue 44.

Hut!

The snap -- the red-shirted D comes with a blitz. Rooney
paralyzes, showing a moment of pure terror in his eyes as
"Beast Man," the DB, pulls up short; the WHISTLE SHRIEKS.
BEAST MAN
(reassuring him)
C'mon, baby, nobody's gonna hit
your pussy ass!
CAP
Yeah -- shucks -- I know. Got happy
feet. Must be gettin' old.
But Rooney's grinning eyes speak of a sea change churning in
him.

INT. SHARK CENTER - STEAM ROOM - DAY

Willie makes his way through layers of steam. There is
only one other player in the bath -- Shark Lavay. Willie
considers leaving but sits... Shark gazes dispassionately
at Willie, who won't look at him.
SHARK
... You know punks come and go in
this league. They get picked up
right out of the 'hood 'cause they
can run or fight, 'cause they're
fast and strong and big. And
suddenly they got all the money
and the foxes that chase the money
-- and they get to live 'the dream.'
But for every sucker who makes it
-- for every Jerry Rice and Barry
Sanders -- there are a hundred
nigras you never heard of.
(MORE)

SHARK (CONT'D)
And when they get a step too slow
or a year too old -- baby, the game
tosses them back onto the street
with nothing and just keeps on
going like nothing happened.
Sure, the game's taught 'em how to
strut their shit and talk trash
and hit -- but what else?...
Suddenly there's no more money, no
more women, no more applause... No
more 'Dream.'

Shark knows it's ending for him.
SHARK
(quietly)
This is what I'm saying to you,
Willie: when a man looks back on
his life, he should be proud of
all of it. Not just a few years
in pads and cleats. Not just
memories of when he was... great.
That he gotta learn in here...
(indicating his
heart)
... or he ain't a man. He just
another punk.
Willie listens, lets it sink in.

EXT./INT. CAP ROONEY'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

Cap Rooney cooks hot dogs on the outdoor barbecue of his
massive suburban home. The lawn is far removed, as most
of the outdoor activity takes place on concrete. The
three Rooney kids (two boys, one girl) are tricycling,
screaming, running through doll houses -- as a busy
Cindy Rooney surveys it from an upstairs balcony on
the cell phone.
TONY
(entering)
Hey, kids are growing, Cap.
Johnny's already got big hands
(the kid corrects his name, TBD).
JOHNNY
My name is Johnny, Coach.
TONY
I forgot, Johnny, sorry, I got so
many names in my head.

JOHNNY
You never remember my name, Coach.
TONY
Don't shoot me.
CAP
Keep your hands off my kids
willya! I'm gonna teach 'em
some golf...

The kids mumble chaotically, as Rooney serves early dinners
on some strange space-age plastic table.
CAP
Who wants the mustard on their
hot dog...? You see the news? This
guy Rose says he's gonna sue you for
a million bucks!
(laughs, shakes
his head)
If it was me, I would've left him
so he couldn't remember zip -- in a
coma. Think they're gonna suspend
you, Tony?
TONY
... Do me a favor. I'd get some
sleep... So, Doc Powers cleared you
for Sunday.
CAP
Great!
(calling out for
help with the kids)
Cindy? A little help!
Yeah?

Cindy acknowledges.
EXT. CAP'S HOUSE - SUNSET
Tony and Cap walk around the edges of a man-made lake
facing the house. During the dialogue, they approach
a veranda area.
TONY
Papers got us as six point dogs,
you believe that? I can't wait to
strap it on and stick it to Dallas
like we used to. Show 'em what
this game is all about. Right
there in the playoffs!

Yeah...

CAP

Tony picks up on a vulnerability in the air.
You okay?
Sure --

TONY
CAP
TONY
(suddenly)
The Doc got it wrong about your
back?!
CAP
My back hurts a whole lot more
than I thought, Tony, I pushed it
too hard.
TONY
We all play hurt, Cap.
need the needle.

You just

CAP
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.
(laughs)
Maybe you oughta go with Willie
though? You know, I been off -my passing -- the whole deal -TONY
I seen you in practice, Cap.
You're ready now. What is it?
EXT. VERANDA - TWILIGHT
Cap doesn't respond or look at him. He sits on a swing.
Tony is stunned as the realization hits him.
TONY
Cap, you don't want to go in?
What is it?
CAP
Tony, it's not that, it's that...

TONY
... You didn't get any phone calls
I didn't know about did you?...
from Christy?
(as Cap shakes
his head)
... You seeing a psychiatrist or
something?
No...

CAP
TONY
Then where the hell is this coming
from, Rock?
(raising his voice)
You wanted to play. I fought for
you! Why didn't you tell me
something, do you realize what I...
CAP
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
TONY
... I went out on a long limb for
you, man! I took on Christina. And
Willie. And the media. And you
do this to me?!? I had four weeks,
I woulda gone another way...
Rooney swinging back and forth, proceeds with great
difficulty:
CAP
I didn't know! I didn't know...
You don't know how much I wanted
to come back, Tony. You have no
idea. This is all I have in my
life. Everything. It's not fun
anymore. I'm not what I was.
Tony, the first time I got hit in
the pros I thought my heart was
going to stop. You're never the
same after that. After all the
hits and concussions, I have these
blank spots in my memory. I

good leg for years, even on a good
day I shake... Sometimes I can't
even hold a spoon right.

CAP (CONT'D)
And I'm on pain killers all the time
'cause of my elbow and my ribs
and my neck and my torn thigh and
now my ruptured disc. But even
now, with all that, I'd go back
in a second... if I could only be
what I was. But if I go out there,
I'm gonna fold... in front of
everybody. The team. My family...
You.
(struggling)
I just can't do that. It's my
body. It's my body.

Tony's disgusted and moved at the same time; relents and
puts a comforting hand on Cap's shoulder; his
quarterback's breaking down right in front of his
eyes -- he's never seen him like this. But Tony,
ever the coach of men, won't allow Cap -- or
himself -- to quit.
TONY
The things you're saying are in
your head, Rock -- they're not
real... You know you've got it in
you, because I know you do!
CAP
Tony... if I could only be what I
was? It's my body, Tony, it's
just not there... Please...
TONY
I need you, Rock -- to lead this
team. The team needs you. I need
you...
Cap dries his eyes, looks at Tony hard.
TONY
One last time. You and me.
Together... Trust me.
CAP
(finally)
... You need me, Tony, I'll do it
for you.
Ridden with doubt, Tony hugs his boy, tightly.

In their screening room, alone:

I don't get it... Jack?
CAP
I'm saying... I got my rings, we
took care of our money, the kids
are all right -- we had a good
run... I just think it's time
for me to get out... after the

And do what?

CINDY
CAP
I talked to the guy from one of
the networks -CINDY
You're a football player.
CAP
Cindy -- will you hear me out?
CINDY
You are a football player and you
have two, three years left in you!
CAP
Honey, you're missing the big
picture -CINDY
There is no 'big picture'! You are
the goddamn quarterback of the Miami
Sharks! You are a legend and you're
talking about quitting?!... You know
what that means to the kids! To me!
CAP
My whole fucking life I've always
done what other people told me to.
Ever since college... what do I do?
This is my decision, not yours!!!
She suddenly slaps him across the face.
CINDY
I will not hear this bullshit from
you! I will not!

EXT. BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Four sexy women in short killer skirts sway like
vampires into the next club... Miami. A world
outside American culture.
Willie entertains his agent, Mercer, at an outdoor club
overlooking the beach. Two beautiful models accompany
them. Attractive people stroll by. Various ETHNIC
MUSIC PLAYS, a warm, highly-artificial setting that
Willie senses, as he listens absently to the dialogue at
the table, a vocabulary reduced to words of expansion,
contracts, and greed. On the table are covers of
Sports Illustrated and ESPN sports featuring Willie.
MERCER
... they'll do it, you know why?
They want you!... and we'll make
'em swallow the beer
distributorship too... the thing is
no one really knows how good you
are, man, Willie. You get in the
playoffs and you score, you get
your moment? -- You can forget
about this team -- they gonna lose
anyhow -- but you get that one
shining moment when they notice
you, 'money, when they really see
you -- then you are a 'star' in
this culture, baby, and you are
looking at five million serious
dollars next year someplace,
anyplace! Maybe L.A. I'm
talking intensely to L.A. Shit,
Christina'll extend you right now
at two million for the year... but
we're gonna wait! That's why you
got me, Willie B. To think about
these things...
MODEL #1
(to Wayne)
Honey, let's go dancing... I'm
bored.
Willie muses at the passing parade.
WILLIE
(absently)
I hope you're doing a lotta
that, Wayne, 'cause what if
I'm not made of steel?
Say what?

MERCER

WILLIE
You know, what if my arm starts
hurtin'?
MERCER
(flummoxed)
Where you coming from with that?
MODEL #2
Baby, that arm's gonna last you
forever.

Willie suddenly spots his old girl friend, Vanessa, moving
towards the ladies' room. He jumps up, follows.
WILLIE
(catching up to her)
Vanessa...?
VANESSA
(turns, afraid)
Willie...?
WILLIE
(shy)
Hi... been a while.
VANESSA
(awkward beat)
Yeah... So, congratulations!...
Yeah...!

WILLIE
VANESSA
You getting what you wanted...?
WILLIE
Yeah, but I was pretty stupid
about it...
VANESSA
No, I don't think so. You were
just...
WILLIE
I blew it, Vanessa. I was a
fool... I'm sorry. You know it
all happened so goddamn fast. I
just wasn't ready for it...
Vanessa looks over Willie's shoulder. He realizes,
follows her glance to a well-dressed, middle-aged
African-American businessman waiting at a table.

WILLIE
... Vanessa, I'd really like to
talk to you -- when you have a...
VANESSA
I don't think so, Willie.
Okay.

No.

WILLIE
I understand... or do I?...

VANESSA
I really don't think we belong
together, you're just too volatile
for me, Willie. I'm a simple
girl, I like simple things. Truth
be told, I don't like football. I
just liked you... I'm sorry.
She goes, sadly.
Willie follows.

After a brief moment of indecision,

INT. RESTAURANT - LADIES' ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa sort of expects Willie to follow.
VANESSA
Willie, get the... outta here!

hair, looks disapprovingly at Willie.

Whoa, Barbara Bush!? Willie

"Barbara Bush" exits in

You are such a jerkoff...!

WILLIE
I know. Just tell me I can call
you, Vanessa, come on! You gotta
tell me here and now -- or I'll
leave you here alone and never
call you again...
VANESSA
(laughs)
You bullshitter! Alright, call me
-- if it'll get you the hell out
of here!
WILLIE
(jubilant, goes)
I'll be callin' you, sweetpea, you
hear me? 'Cause that date of
yours...
(makes a face)
... look like a pallbearer and
that worries me...
VANESSA
At least he's tall. You're just
jealous... Oh, I'll just be
sitting by the phone, waiting...!

She laughs to herself when he's gone, delighted.

INT. SHARK CENTER - D'AMATO'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT
Tony's desk is covered with play diagrams. He's drawing
new routes, as an old JAZZ RECORDING plays softly on the
CD PLAYER... Crozier enters with a pile of computer
printouts.
CROZIER
I took the probabilities on
Texas. Some really promising
stuff on the weak zone coverage.
They run left 85 percent in the
red zone when...
(noticing the
diagrams)
What's this?
TONY
(snorts)
Nothing! I been trying to come up
with some plays that Willie can't
possibly fuck up.
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
(as Crozier laughs,
sits)
Nick, I don't know what the hell
to do? I've tried talking to him
every way I know -- yelling at
him, reasoning with him, inspiring
him -- the whole bit.
CROZIER
Have you tried listening to him?
Try to be sensitive to what
he's -TONY
'Sensitive'? I don't know from
'sensitive'! I only know one way
to coach. Sooner or later they've
got to start acting like men.
CROZIER
... Someone comes at you with a
chop block, chief, and you
stiffen, you gonna get hurt. You
gotta bend... like bamboo in a
monsoon.

Tony doesn't answer, fingers Crozier's printouts.
TONY
All these fucking numbers -- he
runs left 18 percent faster than
he runs right. He plays better
on odd numbered days. Next we're
gonna calculate the angle of his
dick! What're we here for, Nick?
We're technicians!
Unexpectedly, HEELS CLICK down the corridor, and
Christina suddenly walks in, furious -- throws USA Today
Sports across the desk.
CHRISTINA
Congratulations! Was I the last
to know? My own team?
TONY
If you're talking about Rose, I'm
gonna bar his ass from here to
fucking...

CHRISTINA
We'll see about that! I'm talking
about Willie! What the hell are
you doing startin' Rooney? He
hasn't played in six weeks and
you're going to throw him into
the playoffs against the best
pass rush in the league?!
TONY
Cap's my starter, Christy.
CHRISTINA
And if we lose this game
because...
TONY
(raising his voice)
I'll do you one better: in the
off-season I'm gonna trade Willie!
CHRISTINA
(stunned)
You what?! That is not your
option!
TONY
Yeah, it is. The kid can sell a
lot of T-shirts, Christy, but he
is tearing this team apart!!
CHRISTINA
Then you hold it together.
I can't!

TONY
Not with him.

CHRISTINA
Then I'd say we have another
problem!
CROZIER

I think I'll -TONY
(rising instead,
to the door)
Sit down, Nick! You want the big
chair, get used to it first...!
Hey if you feel that way about it,
Christy, I don't know what the
hell I can do for you -- except
take a leak.

CHRISTINA
Will you stop this... posturing!
Where are you going? I'm not
finished. The Commissioner just
called me.
(as Tony stops)
He's gonna fine you a 100 grand...
TONY
(stunned)
For what?! Shoving that talking
turd out of the way? A hundred
G's!
CHRISTINA
... And he wants a public apology
from you to Jack Rose!
TONY
That'll be a cold day in hell,
baby!
CHRISTINA
You will apologize, Tony. The
days when 'Uncle Tony' could just
do what he wants -- calling all
the shots, firing Mandrake when he
wants, smacking sportswriters -those days are over! You start
Willie on Sunday and you make the
adjustment to modern times -- or
you're out, Tony! And that's...
TONY
(explodes)
You think you're gonna tell me
what to do?! Your father never
told me what to do! AND YOU'RE
NOT GONNA START NOW, YOUNG LADY!
CHRISTINA
(not backing down)
Will you stop using my father as a
scapegoat! Do you think you don't
have to deal with me by raising my
father all the time? When are you
going to listen to me! 'Cause I'll
tell you this right now -- I'd
cut my father's ass if we were
losing like this!
TONY
I bet you would, too!

CHRISTINA
... And you know what? I wouldn't
lose a night's sleep over it.
'Cause like you he was
sentimental. And I can't afford
to be. I'm in the business of
holding this team together. That
means selling! Selling tickets,
skyboxes, players. Selling.
That's why Willie works for me.
He sells tickets. And that's why
he's starting Sunday.
TONY
You know, I'm really sick and tired
of you calling me an old asshole!
Your father was no genius. He acted
like he was. And he took a lot of
credit for things he didn't do.
But let me tell you something, he
at least respected me and he
respected the concept of the coach
coaching and the owner owning. I
can't even imagine what he'd think
of you right now with this...
'act' you're putting on, but my
hunch is he'd be ashamed!
CHRISTINA
(in a danger zone)
Here we go again! You don't
listen, do you -Ashamed!

TONY
CHRISTINA
Why the hell do you think he left
me in charge, you bullheaded
moron?! He could've made you
General Manager -- but he didn't,
did he?! Why? Because he knew you
didn't have the guts to do it
without him when he was gone
alright! He told me so himself.
Right there on his deathbed.
That's why, Tony -- because he
didn't trust you anymore. Because
you got old!
These words cut Tony hard.

He puts on his game face.

TONY

Well, this old asshole has a
playoff game in two days. A game
which Cap Rooney is going to start
and finish. Both of you -- get

We FLOAT PAST a large portrait of her father TO the
living room, where we overhear the VOICES of Tony and
Margaret.

INT. PAGNIACCI MANSION - PARLOR - DAY

Tony consults with Margaret. The thick velvet drapes
are always drawn tight here -- banishing the blazing
Florida sun and permanently shrouding Margaret's elegant
parlor in shadows... Today she burns with an oracular
power.
MARGARET
What is it you fear...?
(pause)
You have so much fear, Tony.
TONY
I'm losing the team, Maggie. I'm
losing control. Everything in my
life is about control. I lead
men. I control men.

Did Art think I was past it?... Is
that why he made Christina
President? Did he think I
couldn't win anymore?

I don't know.

MARGARET
You never understood Art, Tony...
He wanted a son more than anything
in the world...
(a considered pause)
When you truly contemplate what
Christina is, it really is a
tragedy. Believe me, she will
fire you and sell the soul of the
team -- and everything her father
stood for will die... and that is
as it should be... and neither you
nor I, or maybe even Christina
herself, will ever understand her
real motives...
Her intensity is unnerving.
MARGARET
... What will you do, Tony? After
football? What's out there for
you? With no one to control?
Stop it.

(quietly)
... I blame you for a lot of
things. You were, like Art, a
monster. You've gotten older...
better, but for a long time I
hated you.

(as Tony is taken
aback)
Yes, that game took my husband, my
daughter, and my youth and left

A SONG plays through the house, ghost-like. Tony
drinks whiskey, pausing, as he goes through his personal
mementoes in his chest of drawers, the TV turned to:
INTERCUT WITH:
TV
On "Sportscorner," Jack Rose, sporting a dramatic bandage
across his head, similar to a Revolutionary War icon,
talks to Sanderson.
ROSE (V.O.)
... Thanks, 'Sandman,' for
asking -- my head is still
hurting, got some migraines...
and the ribs are sure sore.
(grins)
But hey, I play hurt! If you look
at your monitor...
The station runs the famous "shot" again, the ending
blurry with Tony "pushing" Rose into the dugout.

ROSE (V.O.)
... You know this 'punch' was more
than just aggression, it was a
sign of decay I think, because...

Tony roars at the TV.
TONY
Aggggh! If I'd punched you, you'd
be shitting out your teeth right
now -- you vampire prick!
He picks out Mandy's lipsticked telephone number on a
piece of paper and, after a pause, tears it up.
ROSE (V.O.)
... To tell you the truth -- this
is me speaking from the heart now
-- I feel a little sorry for Coach
D'Amato. I always hoped he'd
leave this game with a little
dignity left.
Rose continues to rattle on in the b.g., but Tony ignores
the babble of our time, removing from the drawer a small
wooden box and a framed picture of a younger Tony with
Jeanette, Timmy, and Melinda.
He sets the box aside and picks up the picture. It is
clear now that he is crying. He looks at it for a long
and difficult moment, then sets the picture down and
opens the box -- in it are two glimmering Pantheon Cup
rings.

The MUSIC THEME moves over a deserted field -- the night
TURNING to dawn.
IMAGES slowly move. Ghosts. Men who once played the
game, heroic and shimmering, a thing of glory... We don't
know who these ghosts are, but we sense what they
represent. Some in old leather helmets, the '30s, '40s,
'50s, each era unfolds its changes... le plus ca change,
le plus ca reste le meme... the diving catches, the
magnificent tackles and blocks, the astounding runs and
passes become really the same through time -- accompanied
now by the GROWING ROAR of the FANS...
The MUSIC reaches a CRESCENDO with the dawn breaking, and
the ghosts fade, and the stadium enters time present...

Game 5.

Playoff.

The Dallas Knights stadium, with its artificial,
exaggerated green Astroturf, is spectacular. The fans
are stomping in anticipation.

(Dallas anchor)
... Controversy swirls around the
six point Shark underdogs. Willie
'Steamin' Beamen, the sensational
third-string miracle-mile
quarterback who's held the sinking
Sharks together these last four
weeks, is not starting and is said
to be feuding with his beleaguered
Coach, Tony D'Amato -- who is being
investigated by the League for
having 'hit' local reporter Jack
Rose at practice earlier this
week... Meanwhile, immortal but
vulnerable Cap Rooney -- only six
weeks off a microdiskectomy on his
lower back -- is definitely
starting for the Sharks against
the toughest pass-rush in the
league. Watch for the sparks that
are gonna fly! We'll be right back!

INT. TEXAS STADIUM - BASEMENT - COACH'S ROOM SAME TIME

Coach D'Amato stands at a podium in front of the large
press corps. Jack "Ripper" Rose accepts his apology
with a smug smile and a nicely-dressed bandage on his
forehead.
TONY
... Well, clearly the tension of
the season got to me and I
overreacted to an innocent
question from a journalist we all
know to be of the highest
caliber... I only hope that one
day I'll truly be able to show
Jack Rose just how much I treasure
his invaluable contribution to the
sport of football. Thank you.

He leaves the podium, eyes down... Christina and the
tall, dignified AFFA COMMISSIONER, PHIL JOHNSON, are not
exactly pleased with the apology.

TRAINERS' ROOM #1

The door is closed. As the huge CROWD upstairs makes its
presence known, STOMPING and ROARING, the ECHOES surging
through the tunnels and pipes of the inner stadium, Dr.
Powers, in temporary charge, inserts a large 18-gauge
needle of cortisone directly into the swollen, scarred
knee of Shark, who winces in great pain. Powers drains a
straw-colored liquid into a Dixie cup.
SHARK
(hissing)
God, I hate Texas!
HORNY
(poking his head in)
Whoa! What the fuck they doing to
you, man!
SHARK
M'fucker, they're taking a cyst
outta my ovaries!! Now get the
fuck outta here... please...
Powers now shines a beam of light into Shark's eyes,
moving his finger back and forth in front of his eyes.
POWERS
How's that headache?
SHARK
It was okay till you started doing
that shit...
POWERS
What about your balance?
SHARK
You talkin' my check balance?
Look p-h-a-t, baby -- 'phat.'
Powers retracts the needle.
POWERS
... you're done.
SHARK
Gimme another one.
POWERS
(astonished)
Shark, you don't need it, it
doesn't make any sense medically.

SHARK
(seriously grips
Powers)
I don't give a fuck about medical,
Doc! Give me another one. Just
for this game... please!

A moment passes between them, then Powers relents, goes
to get a fresh syringe. Ironically, he begins perhaps to
understand Mandrake's dilemma as both a doctor and a human
being.

SAME SCENE - LATER
Coach D'Amato stands before the team, humbled, hiding
nothing.
TONY
I don't know what to say really.
We got three minutes left till the
biggest battle of our professional
lives... It all comes down to
today. We either heal as a team
or we crumble, inch by inch, play
by play -- until we're finished.
We're in hell right now, gentlemen,
believe me. We can sit here and
get the shit kicked out of us, or
we can fight our way back into the
light; we can climb out of this
anger and this doubt and this
uncertainty -- we can climb out of
hell -- one inch at a time, or...
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
(pause)
... I wish I could do it for you,
but I can't. I'm too old. I look
around at your faces and I see
young men and I think I made every
wrong choice a middle-aged old man
can make -- my life is a long list
of rookie mistakes. I pissed away
all my money, chased off everyone
that loved me... lately I can't
even stand the face I see in the
mirror.

This team has never heard their Coach take it to such a
personal level.
TONY
... As we get older, some things
are taken away... well, that's
part of life, but you only learn
that when you lose something.
You find out that life is this game
of inches! So's football.
Because the margin for error in
either game, football or life, is
so small... so small, guys. One
half-step too late or too early
and you don't quite make it. One
half-second too slow or too fast
and you don't quite catch it
'cause it's half a fingertip away.
The inches we need are everywhere
around us, they're in every break
of the game, every minute, every
second. Mandrake forgot that. He
was grabbing for miles when he
only needed inches. And on this
team there are no shortcuts.
There are no more Doctor
Mandrakes. On this team we fight
for that inch! We tear ourselves
and everyone else around us to
pieces for that inch! We claw
with our fingernails for that inch
'cause when you add up all those
inches, that is what makes the
fucking difference between winning
and losing -- between living and
dying... In any fight I can tell
you this, it's the guy who's
willing to die who's going to win
that inch.
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
And I know if I'm gonna have any
kind of life anymore, it's because
I'm still willing to fight and die
for that inch...
(beat)
That's what living is.
(sweeps the team
with a look)
The six inches in front of your
face. I can't make you do it.
You have to look around -- look at
the guy next to you -- look into
his eyes -- and I think you'll see
a guy you know will go that inch
with you. You'll see a guy who'll
sacrifice himself for this team
because when it comes down to it,
he knows you would do the same for
him! That's a team, gentlemen!...
And either we will heal now as a
team -- or we will die as
individuals...
Willie listening to these words, with new meaning.
TONY
That's football, guys.
(pause)
That's all it is.
(then)
Now what are you going to do?
Silence... The team, as if one mind, emits a roar of
approval. The players hug and slap each other on the
back. It is a joyous moment of sudden unification and
affection, a savage release of tension.
Julian jumps up onto a table, grabbing their attention.
WASHINGTON
Listen up, listen up! I got
somethin' to say!
The team falls quiet again.
WASHINGTON
Thank you, 'Coach Stone Age'!

WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
(laughter)
But you're right! Hey, you all
know what I've been through. You
all know about the money I get. I
been hearin' all about people
sayin' this and that about me.
But lemme tell ya something: I'm
sick and tired of it!... I love
this game. I want to play this
game with you people -- as part of
a team!!
(as the team cheers)
And I know this sounds corny but I
want to thank Willie Beamen, in
his own fucked-up way, for makin'
me care about this game again.
(turns to Willie)
Come here, you little bastard!
He grabs a smiling Willie into his bear-like hug and
swings him around. This is another moment of
significance. The team goes wild to see these two
finally connecting... And now Monroe feels he must leap
on the bench to speak his piece:
MONROE

INGO

... That's right, Tug, years ago
when Dallas was one and 15, they
blamed it on God, said he was on
vacation that year...

VIDEO FROM MEDIA BOOTH POV - FIELD #1

The opening kickoff as McNaughton calls it.
INGO (V.O.)
It's a huge boot from Croft...
Scanlon takes it in the end zone...
He's running it out...
TUG (V.O.)
Dangerous move...
INGO (V.O.)
Scanlon skirts a tackle... he's
got a block... He's got some
running room...
TUG (V.O.)
(laughs)
Uh-oh! Watch out...!

INGO (V.O.)
He's at the thirty... the thirtyfive!... He's got some
daylight!... He's broken loose!
He could go all the way!!

The Dallas runner (Scanlon) races through Shark defenders
and into the end zone. Dallas fans leap to their feet
-- an enormous, pounding celebration, the sound
heightened by the ECHOEY nature of the stadium.

LUXURY BOX #1

Christina, Ed Phillips, Joe Polito and others watch,
their hopes suddenly dashed.
CHRISTINA
It's gonna be a long day...

Coach D'Amato claps his hands and walks down the

Then bring it home, Rock!
Rooney strides onto the field.

STANDS #1

The Miami section unleashes a great stomp of recognition
and adoration. Huge booing from the Dallas side...

SIDELINE #2
The Shark mascot dances. Cap Rooney is back! Two
Pantheon Cup rings, anything can happen in the memory.
Anything!! Willie applauds as well, looking over to see:

His mom -- with an older lady friend and a younger sister
at the 50-yard line. She waves to him, in her Sunday

for Cap.

HUDDLE #1

CAP
Guys, I missed your ugly mugs.
SANDERSON
Whoa!... Old times, baby! Howszat

CAP
Like Jerry Lee Lewis! Okay, Blue

And don't let that corner take
away the inside, Sandman.

Trip him, tickle his nuts, I don't
give a darn.
SANDERSON

MONTAGE #4 - CAP ROONEY'S COMEBACK

FIELD #2
The ball is snapped... and we go into a SERIES OF CUTS of
Cap Rooney's return -- four plays, all quick, on-themoney passes, inside and out, Cap in control, moving the
team like a whipmaster.

On the fourth play, Cap finds the second wide out (Owens)
for a TD!

"sack dance."
TUG (V.O.)
There he goes! Sack number 12 of

Luther Lavay.

FIELD #5

But Dallas stays right in the game. A short, brokenfield run, 22 yards for a touchdown. (Ingo AD LIBS.)
Each man obviously rooting against the other.

INTERCUT WITH:

SIDELINE #3

Willie listens and watches closely as D'Amato confers
with Rooney, studying Cap's style on the field. He -not Cherubini -- is calling in the plays, which puts him
in the heart of the conflict.

SCOREBOARD #1
MIAMI 10, DALLAS 14.

FIRST QUARTER 2:48...

FIELD #7

Sharks are poised to score on the Dallas 11...

Cap fades back -- a Dallas defender breaks through the
line -- Cap scrambles out of the pocket -- no one can get
open -- he tucks the ball and decisively charges the goal
line.
The "old man" will not be denied in a race to the goal
line. A Dallas defender zeroes in on him. Rather than
slide, Rooney hurls himself into the air, inspired
possibly by the younger Willie and collides head-first
with a Dallas defender -- a thunderclap of sound.
The ball, tight in Rooney's grasp, is planted firmly
beyond the goal line -- touchdown!

SIDELINE #4

The Sharks taste the old glory!

FIELD #8

Rooney pulls himself slowly to his feet, accepting
the
congratulations of his teammates, inwardly numb, outwardly
ecstatic.
INGO (V.O.)
That is the meaning, in one
sentence, of 'Captain' Jack
Rooney. He will not take 'No' for
an answer. I deeply admire a man
of that caliber.
TUG (V.O.)
Ingo, I never seen you that moved
by anything.
INTERCUT WITH:

SIDELINE #5

D'Amato watches Rooney intently, sensing the worst,
but
basking in the glory of it -- the aging charioteer
pauses
in the end zone, opens his breast to the roar of the
crowd. His moment in time.
TIME CUT TO:

SCOREBOARD #2
MIAMI 17, DALLAS 14.

SECOND QUARTER.

11:12...

HUDDLE #2

Rooney's significant pain carries over. His teammates
keep a respectful silence, but he sweats and breathes
with difficulty.
CAP
Awright, come on. Second and two,
gang. Let's get it. Pro Left Y
Switch Zig 90 Fade. On two.
Ready?
As they break:
SANDERSON
(urgent, drawing
a blank)
What's the color?
What?

WASHINGTON
SANDERSON
The live color? I can't remember
the color -WASHINGTON
Red for Chrissake! On two! If
you're fucked up, Sandman? Take
yourself out, man.
SANDERSON
(panicked)
Can't remember the plays!

FIELD #9

Cap fades back, a fake screen to Julian which deceives
Dallas, then he flings it far downfield -- headed for
Sandman...
Rooney thinks it's a lock... But the pass, 45 yards in
the air, is overthrown by inches! -- Sanderson, perhaps a
half step late on his own, stretches but cannot grasp it
-- missing by an inch -- the ball implodes, incomplete,
as the Miami fans moan and the Dallas fans roar.
As Cap walks to the sideline, crossing his punting unit,
an eerie feeling invades a mind already fragile in
confidence.
TIME CUT TO:

SCOREBOARD #3
MIAMI 17, DALLAS 14.

SECOND QUARTER.

FIELD #10

Rooney scans the defense, sees the signs for a full
blitz. Under the center, his hands shake.
CAP
(audibles)
Set! Black 45... razor, razor...
495 max, 495 max... Hut! Hut!
The full blitz at the Miami 35 -- two Dallas speedsters
come from either side -- Rooney fakes a handoff to Julian
and turns upfield -- but both Dallas defenders slam into
him, a devastating double hit -- his body crumples into
the grass.
The ball sails from his hands -- a Dallas lineman
snatching it up on the bounce and sprinting to the Miami

STANDS #5

The crowd, which a few short minutes ago loved this man,
has turned surly and unsure. Time is swift.

STORAGE ROOM #1

In a dark and solitary storeroom, Sanderson is shaking
and sweating, pathetically pleading to Dr. Powers:
SANDERSON
Doc, you're my man. I'm just
asking you this one time... Look
at me.

POWERS
Stop begging, Jimmy. You're
making me nervous. You'd make
water nervous.
SANDERSON
It's like that, okay? It ain't
right, Doc, I never asked you for
nothing! M'fucker! Look at me,
look at my goddamn hands...
(shaking)
Man, i live to catch passes, you
understand that?! Ritalin, diet
shit, anything!
POWERS
Jimmy, we been through this.
can't, I won't...

SANDERSON
You're lettin' me die out there!
I can't beat 'em anymore! Half a
step, it's all I'm sayin', half a
fuckin' step! I'm 28, man, I'm an
old man out there!
POWERS
There is a line, Jimmy. I won't
cross it. You don't need it. You
can win without it.
SANDERSON
Who you shittin'! It's over...
If you could run, catch, feel
what I feel, you'd be a whole
different person, Doc. You're
just trying to hold me down. It's
all right, man, I'll make it
without you! I'll make it without
you, m'fucker...!

TRAINING AREA #2

Trainers #1 and #2 work on Cap Rooney, re-taping his
bruised ribs and back, as Tony crosses in.
Can you play?

TONY
CAP
... Banged up, but I'm okay...

Can you play?

TONY
CAP
Yeah... you bet.
TONY
Rock -- look at me -- can you

Rooney looks at him.

His face tells the story.

TONY
You fought like a son-of-a-bitch
out there, Rock... I will never
forget this.
CAP
... Go do your job, Coach.

LOCKER ROOM #4

Tony moves around the locker room, studying his team.

quietly.

He

TONY
This isn't about you and me
anymore. You've got to lead them,
Willie. When they look in your
eyes, they gotta believe.
I know...

WILLIE
Christina -- surprising everyone -- enters the locker
room, moving quickly past the players. With Ed Phillips
and Joe Polito backing her, she seeks out Tony.
CHRISTINA
What do you think you're doing?
TONY
(seething)
You got no business here -- I told
you not to come here!
CHRISTINA
Don't you see what's going on,
you...
Tony sweeps Christina by the elbow, into the small
visiting coach's locker room.

COACH'S LOCKER ROOM #1

TONY
(as intense as
he can get)
Leave here before I lose my
temper, Mrs. Pagniacci, do you
hear me?!...
CHRISTINA
I don't care what your problem
with him is -- alright!? Cap
Rooney is over! You're the only
one that's failed to see...
Outside, the players listen silently.
TONY
NEVER -- NEVER -- talk that way in
front of my players! Do you
understand!... or I'll spank the
living shit out of you, little
girl!!
CHRISTINA
(scared)
Don't talk to me like that! It's
MY team too! And I don't give a
fuck if Willie's changing the plays!
You let your ego get in the way of
this team, and it is going to cost
us the game!
GET OUT!
He throws a chair.

TONY
GET OUT NOW!

Before I...

Willie enters tentatively...

WILLIE
Miss Pagniacci...? I'm sorry
but...
(as Christina waits)
... Coach D'Amato -- he already
told me I'm going in.
A pause.

They all share looks.
TONY
(quietly)
Jesus Christ, Christy... What the
hell happened to you...?

Christina exits, her dignity intact.

CHRISTINA
(nods to Willie)
Good...! Prove 'em wrong, Willie...

She crosses to the main locker room, her entourage
following.

EXT. DALLAS STADIUM - TUNNEL - NIGHT (SECOND HALF)
Tony is talking fast to Willie as they move down the
tunnel. The sound of the CROWD GROWING...
TONY
... Take control of the huddle,
get 'em in and out quick. Take
advantage of the box while the
speaker's hot.
Yup.

WILLIE (TBD)
TONY
Keep an eye on the front four.
Make them work sideline to
sideline, they'll slow down, and
when you see them, take a knee,
lookin' for some air, they're
losing it. Then you go right at
'em. Control the line of
scrimmage, and you're gonna
control this game.
Yup.

WILLIE
TONY
Stats don't mean shit to me. Get
me five yards on first, and
they'll have to worry about
stopping both you and Julian.
Possession of the ball -- that's
all I want. Move those chains.
Yup.

WILLIE
TONY
Read the safety's drop, if he's
flat footed or in his backpedal,
we go downtown. Keep 'em honest
with your eyes. The longer you
look them off, the tougher it is
for them to make their break.
Surprise 'em, make it sudden, Willie.

Yup.

WILLIE
TONY
What are you, Gary Cooper?
Who?

WILLIE
TONY
Forget it. Remember, keep them
off balance with the hard count.
That will slow the pass rush and
buy you more time. If you see
their arms shaking and their asses
up in the air, they're coming...
Control the line of scrimmage,
you're gonna control this game,
Willie
WILLIE
Coach, you said that already...
TONY
... And don't forget to look for
the mismatches!
(as Willie sighs; he
repeats)
Look for the mismatches. You'll
find one... One more thing!
(carefully)
Right out of the gate, let it fly.
Go 999, and shock the shit out of
'em.
He grins at a surprised Willie.
As they now break from the tunnel, the ROAR of the Dallas
crowd, and the excitement of the sportscaster's voices
overwhelms all.
INGO (V.O.)
Well, everyone knows it's 'crunch
time' for Steamin' Beamen. Cagey
old veterans have been known to
crack under playoff pressure -- so
you gotta wonder how this rather
volatile kid'll stack up...
TUG (V.O.)
No, sir! Prisoners will not be
taken in this second half! The
surviving team goes to Minnesota
next week for the Conference
Championship.

SIDELINE #5

Willie steps to the side, alone -- and vomits quietly...
then he jogs out onto the field for the second half.
TUG (V.O.)
Oh boy! Dallas is in trouble now
'Willie's Ritual.' You know,
Ingo, in Tampa Bay one time you
looked just like that after...
Ingo finally laughs.

HUDDLE #3

Willie, totally focused, assesses his teammates. He
spots Cap Rooney, in uniform, signaling in the play!
WILLIE
Okay, Strong Left Zig 90 Gun, on
three, serious -- it's their call.
And by the way, guys -(beat)
I apologize for having a big head
back there -- but that wasn't me.
It was the Devil Red 6-6-6.
(as they laugh)
Now let's get this bitch before
they know what hit 'em! On
three. Ready!
They clap and break, believing it.

Over Willie:

CAP (V.O.)

Watch for the robber on the
right... you know it's a beautiful
thing to watch you throw, kid!
WILLIE
Good to hear you say that,
not-so-old-man.

FIELD #11

Hut!

WILLIE
Black 41, Black 41!
Hut!

Hut!

Willie steps back, flings it far... 50 aerial yards...
Interception!... An upset roar from the Dallas fans.

SIDELINE #6

Willie jogs back, past Tony, loose about it.
TONY

... hey at least he ran the play I
called!
WILLIE
(to Tony)
One inch to the left, it would've
worked.

LUXURY BOX #3

The AFFA Commissioner, with a small entourage, is
watching part of the game in Christina's box.
CHRISTINA
... Let me on the Finance
Committee, Phil, and I know I
could make a difference with the
networks. I know New York, I...
COMMISSIONER
Your mother looks great, by the
way...
CHRISTINA
Thank you. She's always loved
Dallas. Loves Neiman Marcus.
Great lady.

COMMISSIONER
And your golf?

CHRISTINA
I'm about an 11 now... from the
whites. Think you can take me?
COMMISSIONER
Whoa! Not bad! I'm afraid I'm
not in your class, Christina.
(rising to leave)
Good game. Good team.
(crossing to Margaret
with her two pet
dogs in hand)
Margaret...
MARGARET
It's nice to see you, Phil.
COMMISSIONER
Still miss Art.

MARGARET
I do, too...
(displaying her new
dog)
Have you met Gabrielle?
COMMISSIONER
(a beat)
... so I have.

He moves, with great dignity, to the door.
CHRISTINA
(following him,
unsatisfied)
Phil, I'd really like to...
They're out of earshot at the door. The Commissioner,
obviously under some pressure of his own, decides to
tell her now.
COMMISSIONER
Christina, the owners would like
you to come up to New York for a
meeting. Sometime before the
first of the year... if possible?

Oh?

CHRISTINA
(surprised)
About what, sir?

COMMISSIONER
Well... there's a concern that's
been voiced about some moves that
were made... mmm, on your behalf,
for another Los Angeles franchise
... Several of the Association's
rules may have been violated on
this. We've heard that...
CHRISTINA
(stunned)
Who! Who said this? Who's been
saying this...!
She checks herself.
COMMISSIONER
Is Wednesday this week too soon?
Not at all.

CHRISTINA
That'll be fine, sir.

COMMISSIONER
Good. Then the best of luck to
you today...
He exits.

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BOX

The Commissioner, on the way out, shakes his head, to
an associate.
COMMISSIONER
... I honestly believe that woman
would eat her young.

LUXURY BOX #4

Christina, staggered, turns to Ed Phillips and Johnny.
CHRISTINA
What the hell happened!?
ED PHILLIPS
I don't know, but somebody opened
his big mouth. And I'll bet you
it was our friend the Mayor!
JOHNNY POLITO
You're missing the point, Ed.
This guy definitely doesn't want
her in L.A. That's the point.
Christina is worried.

WILLIE
You gonna let me check off?
Where's the coach I know and love?
TONY
If Branco bites.

You git it, Coach.

Willie scans the defense. As predicted, the Dallas
player (Branco) is tensed for the blitz, his knuckles
white to the astroturf.
WILLIE
(audibles)
Set! Blue 22... razor, razor...
955, 955... Hut!
Branco breaks through! Willie, expecting it, throws a
classic screen pass to Julian, who rumbles for 15 plus
yards.
Branco lies on the field, bleeding. His eyeball lies
several feet away. It is shocking, and quickly covered
up by the TV cameras.

A classic sweep follows, run by Washington, thundering
towards Tony on the sideline; he turns the corner with a

You can beat him, Willie. I know

Cap's eyes are solid, supportive.

Willie believes.

CHRISTINA'S LUXURY BOX #5
In a quiet moment, Christina notices most of her
associates talk business on cell phones or to each other,
only watching the game in quick eyebursts -- she hears a
buzzing chorale of "increasing market shares" and
"merchandizing revenue streams" and "league relocation
protocols..." Margaret sits in a quiet corner with a
friend, sipping on a Bloody Mary. She smiles over at
her daughter.

FIELD #16

The Shark offense is on the Dallas 25, third and seven.
Willie is over the ball. His eyes focus... A Dallas
safety has his "go to" foot a slight inch ahead of the
other. Willie smiles.
WILLIE

Willie spins back and hands the ball off to Washington on
a counter. Washington shoots through the line with room
to run.
Go, baby!

WILLIE
Downfield, a Dallas defender tries to force Washington
out of bounds, but spinning on a dime, Washington cuts
back towards the center of the field -- Dallas defenders
tackle him -- one, two, three at a time -- but he drags
them for another five yards -- into the end zone.
Touchdown!... Willie is the first downfield to jump all
over him.

The Dallas QB shoots back, handing off to the running
back. Shark waits, poised to fill the hole. The back
powers forward, no running lanes -- he bounces to the
outside, sees daylight, speeds for it...
Shark runs desperately to the same hole on his bum and
swollen knee. The runner is almost to the first down
marker -- inches! -- He dives for it!
Shark dives at the exact same time -- an all-out lunge of
sheer faith to stop the first down -- at any cost!
Shark and the runner collide, a loud crash! The runner
is stopped! An inch or two short of the first down

Willie notices Sanderson is rattled, his eyes closed,
sweating a storm.

WILLIE
Fourth Quarter. 55 seconds left.
It's do or die. Pro Left Red 88
Bronco. On two... You tight,
'Sandman'?

Eye to eye.
SANDERSON
Tighter than pussy on pre-wedding

WILLIE
(grins)
That's why you're the best! You
like pussy as much as I do! Okay
then, let's show these big-ass
Texas boys what road-kill looks
like! Keep it lethal, 'money.
We're through on two.

Willie again sees nothing, the receivers all expertly
covered. But then he sees -- a chance -- a desperate
chance -- Sanderson is slanting free downfield -285

SIDELINE #16

Tony sees it as well:
Do it!

Do it!

TONY

FIELD #24
Willie takes that cubic centimeter of chance; he flings
it deep... In breathless suspense, the ball sails.
Sanderson, sweating like a pig in his helmet, sees it,
adjusts his route mid-stride... It's as if it is his soul
flying towards him, which he now catches! And then runs
it in another 15 yards into the end zone! A miracle!
Jimmy Sanderson feels himself freed of the demons!

SIDELINE #17

A frenzied celebration on the Miami sideline -- in the
stands -- they've won! But suddenly... Tony is
crestfallen.

FIELD #25

A yellow penalty flag lies on the field... Holding!
REFEREE #3
No touchdown. Holding on
offense #69. Repeat second down.
Ten yards.
Madman furiously shoves Referee #3 in argument, and the
Referee ejects him from the game (AD LIB).

Oh, that might just be the backbreaker right there!

That would take the air out of any
tire. It's gonna take an enormous
amount of will now to...

Christina and her guests groan.

The entire field stretches before Willie and the offense

Christina sits down next to her mother; they talk

Nice and easy, boys. One play at

kiss the sideline like it's the
hottest momma you ever seen and we
are there! Lemme hear it,
brothers!

Lemme hear it again!
(louder, even more
inspired)
Now let's see the swagger,
motherfuckers!

The team claps, breaks, and starts to the line. The
Dallas defense is worn by the swagger and trash-talking
coming right at them.
CAP (V.O.)

weakside safety. He's pretending.

MONTAGE #5 - TWO-MINUTE DRILL (5TH GAME)

FIELD #26
A flurry of plays -- Tony firmly in control -- each
play
well-called and quickly executed -- relayed from Tony to
Crozier, to Cap to Willie. A chain of minds.
Every
person doing their job.
QUICK CUTS AND FLASHES
Subjective -- A caught pass -- a runner leaps out of

Willie looks at him and laughs.

Well, frankly, Coach, it sucked -needed more seasoning... That's

I thought that. Just go out and
kick their ass and win the game!

Crozier breathes and relays the play to Cap, on to Willie.

Willie pump fakes a pass to Sanderson -- the Dallas
defenders flinch left to cover him -- Willie immediately
takes off right with the ball, skimming the outside of
the line -- Madman delivers a devastating block -- Julian
runs slightly behind Willie, ready to throw his block -... but Willie sees some daylight, and tears down the
sideline -- the Dallas safety is racing him -- Just as he
zooms in on Willie, he laterals the ball to Julian just
behind him...
Julian snags the ball -- leaps around the safety, who
slams Willie out of bounds -Julian races against time down the sideline, turning on

A sudden torrent of movement -- Miami slams forward -Dallas slams back -- in SLOW MOTION, Julian reaches for
the handoff -- the ball slaps into his stomach -- a
convincing fake -- as Willie keeps the ball -- Julian
leaps left -- Dallas defenders surge to cover him -- at
that moment Willie chooses to go right back over the hole
Julian has collapsed.
High over the goal line -- he seems to sail through the
air for suspended moments -- he is almost there -- almost
across the plain of the goal line, almost to glory -- as
a wall of Dallas players rise up to meet him like a
breaker at sea... Willie crashes into it...

BRIEF SHOT OF GHOST

whoever he be -- from another time -- diving with him.
Willie seems to bauble the football as he disappears into
"big Wednesday." All SOUND CEASES. Wind plays off the

draped and intertwined like smoking car wrecks, referee
#2 digs out the players, one by one, looking for the ball
... the tension rising to extraordinary heights! Where
the fuck is it?

Willie is hauled into the air by his ecstatic teammates.
The Dallas crowd is stunned and silent; Miami fans are
ecstatic!

Great game... whoever you are.

Thank you, Cap.

Rooney are left in a corner of the quiet locker room.
CAP
I'm calling it quits.
You sure?
I'm sure.

CAP
A beat.

TONY
I'm sorry I put you in, Cap.
CAP
Oh, hell!

relieved)
I'm not. They needed to see me
fail. So I did! And I'm glad
Cindy got a taste of it. Now
maybe I can get on with my life...
I'll see you around the pasture,

He exits.

COACH'S LOCKER ROOM #2 - LATER

Christina reenters the same small room where she fought
with Tony at halftime.
CHRISTINA
Congratulations!
TONY
Thanks.
How's Cap?

CHRISTINA
TONY
He's okay. He'll be leaving after
the season... So will I...
She nods, not surprised.
CHRISTINA
(nods)
I'm sorry it ended up this way,
Tony, I know you don't believe it
but I really am... Seeing the team
out there today -- it was like
going back in time...
(remembering)
God, it was beautiful football!
It was.

TONY
It was beautiful.

A beat.

CHRISTINA
This used to be a hell of a sport,
didn't it?
It still is.

He walks on.

TONY
Christina watches after him.

EXT. TEXAS STADIUM - NIGHT

Tony walks out onto the field where Willie stands alone,
a football in hand, watching as the groundskeepers unroll
the large tarps and stadium personnel pick through the
stands. The stars are abundant this night.
Nice night.

TONY
They walk together across the field.
WILLIE
Mmm... Can't get over Cap. I
learned more watching him in the
first half than I did in five
seasons... Next week I'm gonna
win it just for him.
TONY
Glad to see success hasn't gone to
your head too much, kid...
WILLIE
Steamin' Beamen...? Never.
TONY
Don't pat the ball.
Coach...?

WILLIE
TONY
Don't pat the ball before you
throw, it's getting to be a habit,
and they're seeing it too easy...
(as Willie looks at
the ball he is
holding)
This is your moment, Willie.
Savor it.
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
(beat)
But never forget: on any given
Sunday, you're either gonna win or
you're gonna lose. The point
is...
WILLIE
'... Can you take it like a man?' I
got it, Coach!

Tony gazes around the stadium, taking it all in.
TONY
Next year I'm out of here.
WILLIE
... I figgered...
TONY
I'm not the right guy for this
team anymore. I wanna see my
grandkids. I wanna start living
again... I wanna wait on a grocery
line. I wanna walk on a sidewalk.
I wanna do nothing... As long as
it's not fishing...
WILLIE
(laughs)
... I don't think there's anything
else you could do, Coach.
TONY
... There was this great
quarterback in the '70s I knew.
This guy was one tough
sonofabitch. Fought for every
inch he got. Didn't have your
natural skill, this guy, but he
made it happen, he won... So time
went by and he didn't know it,
but his day was over. He couldn't
go deep like he used to and he
started missing the easy
underneath routes... the game was
just passing him by... Anyway, I
ran into him a few weeks ago in
L.A. and we had a few beers, we
started talking and you know what
he said?
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
He said that when looked back at
those 200 whatever-they-were
Sundays, he didn't really miss the
Pantheon Cups or the girls or the
money or even the goddamned glory!
What he missed were those other
guys looking back at him in the
huddle. Those eleven guys -their names he could hardly
remember -- but it was their faces
he remembered... every one of 'em
seeing things the same way.
Looking downfield. Together.
(beat)
That's what he missed... I'll miss
you, amigo.
Tony pats Willie affectionately on the arm and walks off.
Willie's expression is gentle, appreciative. He drops
back three quick, lithe steps, and sails a long, perfect
spiral down the empty field.
WILLIE
So... my arm, y'know, Coach, I met
with this specialist and...
He turns to look for Tony.

But he's already gone.

WILLIE
(quietly, to himself)
I'm scared...

EXT. VERANDA (MIAMI VILLA) - DAY

Press conference.
SUPERIMPOSE:

ONE MONTH LATER

TONY
(as if in response
to Willie)
... Hey, we're all scared. If you
think any coach these days got
himself a secure visa out of
Casablanca, you need a Mandrake
X-ray.
(off laughter)
I'm a triple-decker stress sandwich
right now...

REPORTER #1
Why's that, Coach? The 32-13 loss
to Minnesota?
TONY
(smiles)
Not even close... try fishing,
Johnny.

He's responding off-handedly to a FEMALE REPORTER'S question
on the stairs leading up to the veranda of an Italianstyle villa housing the Pagniacci Foundation. The group
mills nervously; something's in the air.
TIME CUT TO:
CHRISTINA
stands before the assembled press corps -- Coach D'Amato
moving to her side on cue. Nick Crozier sits close by.
Margaret Pagniacci and the Mayor attend.
CHRISTINA
(reading)
Thank you all for coming today...
I guess you've heard all the
rumors about the Sharks leaving
for Los Angeles because Mayor
Smalls was reportedly unable to
get City Council approval for
stadium improvements...
(as Smalls tightens)
... but let me make this as clear
as I can to you: We -- the Sharks
-- have no intention of leaving
Miami. We love this town, and we
love our Shark Stadium -- and we
will continue to remodel it, at
whatever cost, to make it a home
away from home for our fans!
(looking pointedly at
the Mayor)
And we have great confidence at
the final hour that our Mayor will
be there for us...
The Mayor accepts the applause, but some in the press
mutter among themselves, believing they know the real
story.

CHRISTINA
... You know, I came to a
revelation recently. I realized
how much I love this game, and I
want to live up to what my father
left me: a legacy, a feeling
that this is our house -- the
Pagniacci house... I am resolved
therefore to stick it out here in
Miami because the Pagniaccis
are not quitters and we will never
let this town down!
As they applaud, Christina turns to Margaret. United
behind the family name, they seem to have discovered
each other again.
CHRISTINA
Nick...?
(sees Nick standing)
Nick Crozier -- our new Head
Coach. Welcome!
(as Crozier nods in
response to the
polite applause)
Tony D! Thank you!... Always!
Wherever you go, know this: you
will always be a 'Shark' in your
heart. You will always be
remembered with great respect and
love. 'Whatever it takes,'
right?... And Tony...? Thanks
for making me understand what I'd
forgotten -- that football is more
than a game. It's a way of life!
Tony D'Amato, everybody, give him
a hand!
She hugs Tony as he steps to the podium.
TONY
Thank you, Christy... I really am
sorry I've not been able to
deliver to you and the fans
another Pantheon Cup. San
Francisco sure took care of that
for me...
(off good-natured
laughter)
It's been way too long not to win
the Big One. But in football, as
in life, things change and fresh
blood is needed...
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
(beat)
... So I guess it's time for me to
get the hell outta the way. Bring
in the new. I think Nick Crozier
is gonna do a great job...
(nods to Crozier)
... Most of all, I wanna thank the
people of Miami for their long
support over these last 20something years... Geez, it flew
by like... like any other Sunday,
but it's meant everything to me
and I've had a great ride. Too
good a ride for any one man. I'm
gonna miss you all. Thank you...
There is significant, heartfelt applause from some, not
all. Rose, in spite of himself, is regretful to see his
nemesis depart, muttering to a colleague.
ROSE
I'm gonna miss that arrogant
S.O.B...
(studying Crozier)
Crozier's a wimp compared to
D'Amato.
Tony acknowledges the applause, about to leave the podium
-- but then seems to change his mind.
TONY
... I almost forgot... In thinking
about change, I guess I felt it
was time for me to change, too.
Y'know, like an old vampire, I
need a new blood supply...
(some laughter)
it was Willie Beamen who taught
me how... to give it another shot.
(as the press is
murmuring, wondering)
... So, starting today, I am
taking over as Head Coach of that
new expansion team in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, the Aztecs.
(as a wave of
questions roll across
the balcony)
Why? 'Cause they're giving me
full management control. How can
I pass that up? I guess the
bigger I get, the more ridiculous!
(MORE)

TONY (CONT'D)
(off laughter)
... But hoping not to make a fool
out of myself out there, I have
just signed Willie Beamen as
starting Quarterback and
'franchise player' for the
Aztecs...
Now there is pandemonium on the veranda. Christina's
expression drops, crossed. Crozier looks like he's going
to throw up. Tony grins. That's the way it goes.
TONY
So, Miss P., I look forward to
seeing you next year across those
sidelines... and calling it what
it always was and still is: a
game. Let's keep it that way...
So long, everybody.
He waves and walks out -- leaving Christina and Crozier
to deal with a bewildered and upset press corps.
