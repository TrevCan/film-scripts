BLACK SCREEN.
TILT DOWN TO:

EXT. STREET - FRANK - TWILIGHT

The haze and rain of winter weather is incandescent.
It RAINS. A little jumpy, he looks out at something. We don't know what. His hair is wet.

CLOSER - FRANK

on the sidewalk watching from another angle.

OVER HIS SHOULDER - APARTMENT BUILDING

across the street down the block. People coming
home from work race for doorways. As Frank watches,
we don't know who he is. We don't know why he's
looking at this building.

CUT TO:

INT. BLACK ELDORADO - FRANK'S POV - SAME BUILDING

but pebbled by rain. He watches from inside the
car, now. Closer. He gets out. THROUGH the
pebbled WINDSCREEN we SEE him turn up the collar of
his coat and enter.
CUT TO:

INT. BUILDING - REAR SHOTS - FRANK - DAY

up stairs.
CUT TO:

3/29/80

INT. APARTMENT - VI - TWILIGHT

BUZZER. VI rushes from the bedroom pulling a bathrobe
together at the SOUND of an ENTRY. A baby CRIES.
Who is it?

VI
Who's there?!

...and sees Frank who can't get in because the chain
is on the door. She opens it. The TV is BLASTING.

VI
(continuing; off guard)
I thought you're working tonite?

The living room has chrome Onkyo receivers and Betamax
TV's and clock radios, silver swirl mirrors and a vinyl
bar. Lots of cheap chrome appliances. Frank has entered
his own apartment.

TWO SHOT

APRIL cries O.S. Vi didn't expect Frank. She's a
great-looking trashy broad with white hair, a blue
rinse. Something else is going on.
VI
Forget something you need for
work, dear?
FRANK
(beat)
I thought you're out getting your
hair done?
(beat)
Why's the baby crying?
April cries louder.
VI
(shrieks to April)
Shut up!
(hisses at Frank)
I know about you!
FRANK
(half to himself,
quietly)
...this is not the way it's
supposed to be.
VI
I know what you been doing!

CONTINUED

FRANK
What have I been doin'?

Oh yeah?

VI
I figure it out. You weren't
at the car lot last night. I
checked. You weren't out buying
cars and working so goddamn hard
at night. You're out screwing
some fancy lady! Some whore on
the side you're balling, aren't
you?

FRANK
(laughs)
You're crazy. You don't have a
clue what I do at night.
Then it falls off.

Frank pushes past.

Vi's scared.

INT. BEDROOM - FRANK

moves through, enters bedroom. April cries louder.
The TV BLASTS. She shrinks back. Frank rips into
the closet.
VI
(shrieks)
You cheating rat bastard. You son
of a bitch. You're out getting
laid. Every night!

CLOSER - ROY

in polyester trousers and shirt, is between the clothes
and wall. Vi drops to the floor. Her robe falls open
in the f.g.
Ohmigod.

ROY
Ohmigod.

VI
I am... I am paying you back!
I'm paying you back. That's all!
Vi shrieks as Frank whips Roy across the room by his
neck. He crashes upside down into the wall.

He falls off the bureau.

HANDHELD - TWO SHOT

Frank picks Roy off the ground and bounces him off more
walls, knocking over chrome kitchen chairs and appliances. He throws him through the house on the installment plan as Vi shrieks, as:
FRANK
(back to Vi)
I been true to you since the day
we met! I never, ever, since we've
been married, been out with
another broad! 'Cause that's how
it was supposed to be! I been
busting my ass! I been doin' a
bottle of Bennies a week to keep
goin' working day and night! I
am popping $1400 a month for the
funny farm you got this joint
turned into so you can get your
hair painted blue in the beauty
shop every day with your mother,
who so goddamned dumb she can't
boil water, taking care of April
instead of you. And you got the
balls to think I'm out snaking
around with the broads!!

INT. HALLWAY - HANDHELD - FRANK

throws Roy -- screaming -- down the stairs and
ignores him.

INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - FRANK

returns, hearing April cry from her bedroom crib.
FRANK
You rotten fucking bitch!
April here yet!

With

VI
(shrieks)
April! Why always fucking April!
Vi is suddenly fear-struck at what she said.

She knows Frank will kill her.

FRANK

steers her gently -- as if she were wet -- through the
kitchen, to the door.
FRANK
I take April. She stays with me!
You are completely unfit! You
don't give a damn! You are out!
You, your mother, your boyfriend
stick your face in front of me,
or try to hurt or grab the kid -they find you belly up inna lake.

INT. HALLWAY - FRANK

whips her out of the apartment and throws her at Roy.
FRANK
And you, you stone jagoff!
Congratulations! You just got
yourself a broad!
Frank slams the door.

INT. APRIL'S BEDROOM - FRANK

takes April from the crib into the adjacent bath and
rinses her off in the bath with the shower hose calming
her down...
FRANK
Yeah. There ya go. I gotta get
you a pet turtle and stuff. How
would you like that? Huh? And
our own house. With a swing. And
a dog. And trees 'cause they
rustle at night a lot. Huh?
He holds his daughter wrapped in a towel in the white
tiled bathroom.
CUT TO:

INT. SALT AND PEPPER CAFE - FRANK - TWILIGHT
in a leather jacket in bright light.

The exterior and interior is white ceramic tile.
Under the "El" tracks, it is the cafe in Hooper's

out the window up at his apartment.
Coffee.

FRANK

COUNTERMAN
Coffee...? Whaddya got?

FRANK
(throws a dollar
at the Man)

Counterman shuts up and pours. The ashtray and
demolished newspaper says Frank's been there awhile.

You get hungry, order delivery or
whatever. Use the security chain
though...
MRS. B.

Sure. Okay.
Hey, kiddo...

FRANK

Frank picks April up and kisses her.

He looks at her

FRANK
(continuing; to
Mrs. B.)
Look at that face, huh?
(beat)
She's into animal cookies. She'll
boost a whole box off you...
MRS. B.
Mr. Frank. You're checking up.
Don't worry! Okay? Us girls
are getting along just great.
Everything's fine and dandy.
FRANK

Okay.

(smiles; kisses April)
Okay, kid: Daddy's gotta go to
work, now.
Frank out the door.

HOLD.

MUSIC.

EXT. MOTEL (LINCOLN AVENUE) - FRANK - NIGHT

Eldorado driven by BARRY enters and picks him up. PAN
180 degrees as car whips away under the "EL" track into
the rain. HOLD. MUSIC.
CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEY - BLACK NIGHT

MUSIC. TILT DOWN INTO a black canyon. A narrow fissure between 20-story-high downtown walls: the rears
of buildings. Fire escapes are like black lace. Light
rain. At the bottom is a Buick Regal with steamed windows.
JOSEPH, an older man is SEEN dimly inside. Colored lights
play on his face. They're from...

CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEY - TELEPHONE POLE - ILLINOIS BELL JUNCTION
BOX - NIGHT

A mass of color-coded wires lead out. TILT DOWN the
spaghetti confusion TO a beaten-up Samsonite suitcase.

BARRY STRATAGAKIS

28, tall, monitors the confusion of wires, meters and
telephone gear. The gear's industrial, not slick.
We don't understand its function. Barry's alert,
sharp. His hair's soaked by the rain. It's cold.
He blows on his hand. An O.S. WHINE becomes...
CUT TO:

INT. VAULT AREA - FRANK - NIGHT

mounted on magnets like a horizontal drill press.

inner doors. He pulls the combination dial from the
inner door, screws in a heavy dent-pulley and they
slam open.
CUT TO:

INT. VAULT - TRAYS - NIGHT

of unmounted diamonds in glycine envelopes are poured
into an open bag. He flings the empty trays over his
head, CLATTERING into the interior.

BAG - DIAMONDS

leaves trays of mounted jewelry as if so much junk.

EXT. ALLEY - FRANK - NIGHT
coming out carrying the drill.

Fast.

The WIND HOWLS.

BARRY

comes off the ledge leaving the bypasses intact. Takes
drill from Frank. They leave behind all non-essentials.

BUICK

pulls up. Frank throws the tool belt, Barry throws
drill inside. Buick roars away.

FRANK AND BARRY

dumps the overalls revealing the black jacket.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAGE BRIDGE - PONTIAC

Northbound on Wells, west on Courtland past Finkel's
Foundry and north on Halsted through the wind into
dark wasteland of cartage warehouses busy with truck
traffic.

EXT. HAINES STREET - PONTIAC

passes CAMERA, among the pillars beneath Ogden, circles
and comes back. Barry throws open a garage door. Frank
pulls into the "drop."
CUT TO:

INT. DROP - WIDE - NIGHT

Frank cuts the engine, leaves the black jacket in the
Pontiac. It's an industrial garage. (Work benches,
tools, a drill press, heliarc welding gear and the
Buick Regal are inside.) Barry kills the lights.
They're out the door.

EXT. ALLEY - FRANK - NIGHT

-- cold in his sweatshirt -- crosses to and throws
on his grey coat from inside the black Eldorado and
steps inside. Barry's Corvette pulls out. Frank
leaves in the opposite direction.
CUT TO:

EXT. JETTY - FRANK - DAWN

walks the jetty -- black and narrow into the lake's
flat pewter. A band of red is the sun in Michigan.
An old black FISHERMAN's near the end, his gear in
shopping bags. Frank walks to the end carrying a
coffee-to-go that steams. He has a bag of rolls.
... Mornin'.

FISHERMAN

FRANK
What to it, Captain...
Coldt!
coldt.

FISHERMAN
Mackerels run where it's

Frank sits at the end, swings his legs on the edge like
a kid. The sun bends the horizon line and then breaks
through. Liquid. It's still. He drinks his coffee.
Wanta Danish?
Yeah.

FRANK

FISHERMAN
Thanks.

FRANK
Look at that, huh?
FISHERMAN
That's magic. That's the Sky
Chief, man. That's what that is.
(long pause)
Ain't that Sky Chief sumthin'?
Huh.
Frank's face is washed with gold light. The sky behind
is electric blue and faraway. This is Frank's moment
of satisfaction, of mastery, of having put everything
back in order.
CUT TO:

EXT. ROCKET USED CARS - TRACKING WITH ASTRO AL - DAY

Then he had to stop about the
Chrysler with the cracked block...
CUT TO:

INT. TERMINAL BAR AND RESTAURANT - WIDE - MORNING

NOISE OF VOICES, DISHES, LAUGHTER, short-order cooks
BANGING STUFF, etc. It's busy and frantic and shiny
inside. That's the flow... It's cold outside. Windows are steamed. Frank moves through the early-50's
mixed hip-working-class and young attorney crowd at
the door.

REAR BOOTH - JOE GAGS
is 200 pounds of muscle gone to flab. He looks up as
Frank enters and gestures to a waitress for coffee.
FRANK
(low)
Put your hand out.
Gags slides over the paper on the booth seat. Frank
slips the stones from last night into the paper and
slides it back to Gags.

3/29/80

GAGS

looks down. He feels the weight, impressed. O.S.
someone BREAKS A PLATE. APPLAUSE. More NOISE.
GAGS

All right!

What do you make it?
FRANK

Fifty-nine, D -- flawless, to VSI-1,

FRANK
My money goes in the bank. You

GAGS
Let me get the check
Forget it.

FRANK

3/29/80

Frank leaves through the multiplex NOISE and crowds to
Jessie. She's up-market for this place. They talk
loudly over the NOISE as she comes on duty.
FRANK
(continuing; paying)
I thought you were on mornings?
JESSIE
(without looking up)
They switched me to noon to closing.
FRANK
You like that better?

JESSIE
Six of one, half a dozen of the other.
How's your family?

FRANK
April's terrific! A year-and-a-half

What's it, new?

Yes.

JESSIE
Bring them in!

FRANK
(paying)
I bring April in here, you are

They like each other. We'll see her again. Frank
passes through the crowd waiting to be seated at the
door, and through the glass climbs the Eldo and pulls
out.

CUT TO:

INT. ROCKET CARS SALES OFFICE - FRANK

behind a gas station across the alley. The letter on
Joliet State Penitentiary stationery. In childlike
printing:

CONTINUED

FRANK
(Haltingly, without
punctuation)
'Dear Frank, nothing new ever
happens around here. No, I don't
need any money or anything. Go
slow and EZ and keep knocking them
dead. I could never find the
words to tell you how proud I am
'cause you are making your life
happen like you said and collecting
your debt back from society. And
I know you're pretty busy, but
could you come up 'cause I gotta
see ya. Your pal, Okla.'

Frank unfolds his wallet to place the letter inside.
A tattered paste-up collage is there, too. He opens it.
There's a white house from a magazine. A cut-out
Cadillac is glued in front.
Bits and pieces of trees are drawn in with green Pentel.
A small baby from a Gerber food ad is near a woman -mother. Okla's black and white face is there. It's
weird. We don't know what it means yet. Frank carries
it with him wherever he goes. Frank refolds it with
the letter and pockets them.

Then he crosses to the

It's the dimensions of a cell -- 5' x 10'.

CUT TO:

INT. BLACK ELDO - TRAVELING - FRANK - NIGHT

CUT TO:

INT. TERMINAL RESTAURANT - JESSIE IN THE REAR - NIGHT

What do you think I'm kidding!
JESSIE

Uh... Maybe I should've waited for
Mary.
(explains; awkward)
Look... I don't have relationships.
Involvements. Nothing complex... like
with married men. Right now... at
this time... Okay?
(beat)
How's the car business?
FRANK
The car business is fine. I'm golden and
glowing -- scoring like a champ and becoming a big goddamn captain of industry. And,
right now at this time I am unmarried, Vi is
gone. I am now a free man. And how'd you get
an attitude like you got?
JESSIE

a cigarette machine, what a woman
smelled like. You know? I did
not know what I was supposed to do.

OKLA

Used to be a guy like that? He lasted
five days, woulda been a new world's
record. Well, you know. Now?

Nothing's with the wife.

FRANK
Put Humpty Dumpty back together

She's with me....

OKLA
Anyone know...?
FRANK

Other than Barry and the two, three

I got two, three years 'til I can
split.
(an impossibility:)
What do I do? Bullshit her along?

OKLA
Lie to no one. Someone's close

And if they're a stranger, then
who the hell are they that you
gotta lie to?
FRANK
(quietly)
What did you want?
OKLA

Get me outta here.

you talk?
No.

FRANK
You see our '... man'?

BARRY
There is no 'man.' He's splattered
all over the fucking sidewalk.
What do you want to do?
Barry's referring to the emergency vehicle lights flashing OUT OF FOCUS outside, down the block. Norland Ambulance *
pulls away with SIREN. Another squad car arrives.
FRANK
He down the merch?
BARRY
I was talking to somebody's somebody.
I will know in 25 minutes.

FRANK - AFTERNOON

Barry drives.
BARRY
Gags was putting juice loans on
the street. Right? For this lice,
Attaglia. Gags was pocketing the
principal and putting it back onna
street for himself -- they went
crazy... ba-boom!
Barry pulls in and parks in front of L&A Plating on
Ogden Avenue. A brown grim building among warehouses
and small shelters under a forest of water towers on
roofs:

FRANK
Gags down our merch?
BARRY
At the R.D. Lounge Pauli saw it go down.
It was your money that was in Gags' pocket
when he went out the window.

Frank pulls a .45 Colt Commander from the passenger
door, checks there's a shell in the chamber and
holsters it in his waistband. Barry waits in the

Carl looks Frank over and nods.
RECEPTIONIST

I'll buzz you in.

INT. ATTAGLIA'S OFFICE - ON DOOR - DAY
Frank enters. VINCENT ATTAGLIA is a large businessman in his late 40's. Frank crosses all the way to
the right of Attaglia's desk so his position covers
both Attaglia and the door.
ATTAGLIA
I'm Mr. Attaglia. You didn't get
a delivery or something? Sit
down. Zinc what?
FRANK
My name's Frank.
(sits)
That was bullshit.
What is this?

ATTAGLIA

FRANK
This is Joe Gags. $183,300 of
my money. We have this problem...
ATTAGLIA
What are you talking about?
FRANK
(reasonable)
He moved my merchandise. So the
money in his pocket before he
went out the window is my money...
I want my money.
ATTAGLIA
I don't know what you're talking
about, Mr. Frank a-la-la.
Whatever. The guy died?
Yes.

FRANK

ATTAGLIA
So it goes to probate? Take it
up in probate court! Don't bug
me with this shit...

I come to discuss a piece of
business. And what are you
gonna do? You gonna tell me
fairy tales?

Who the fuck are you, Slick? I

some clown named 'Gags'! Get the
fuck out of here! Beat it!
(shouts to outside,
stands, gets up;
reaches for drawer)
Hey, Carl!!

FRANK

simultaneously slams Attaglia's face with the heel of
his left hand, drawing the .45 with the right, as he
steps back into a Weaver stance three feet from
Attaglia's face. Cold.

WIDE

Richard and Carl. Frank drops the Weaver, the .45 to
the side, strong-arms Attaglia into the line of fire,
snaps the .45 back into his face.
FRANK
(shouts)
Hold it!!
ATTAGLIA
All right! All right!
Do what he tells you!

All right!

FRANK
On the floor! Spread your legs!
Hands over your head! Now!
They do it. They're immobilized. Attaglia's scared
shitless. One guard, Carl, watches Frank. The .45's

Carl)
Look at the wall!
He does.
FRANK

Attaglia)

Mitch is even heavier. Leo is a kidder. He has good
humor. Charm. He's a nice man. He'd kill you as
soon as look at you. He wears a black cashmere topcoat over a plaid shirt. Among the cars in the b.g.
is Leo's black BMW 733i.
ATTAGLIA
He 'downed merch to Gags' is what
he said. I'm telling you this

C'mon, c'mon. I thought we'd talk

FRANK
Nothing personal but I want to

country club...
LEO
(laughs)
But I know you already.
No reaction.
Yeah?

FRANK

(beat)
How do you know me?
LEO
The merch you put to Gags and
Max Sherman and that Puerto Rican
fence, Cotazar? Where do you
think they down it? To me. I'm
the bank. I handle the fence
for half this city. You're
putting down two, three scores
a month. Month in, month out.
And I see your stuff. You got
great taste. A regular highline
pro. I told Gags, 'I want to
meet this guy!' He tell you that?
Yes.
Fine.

FRANK
LEO

FRANK
Let's cut the bullshit.
LEO
(beat; then)
You want to go to work for me?
Directly? You'll put down contact
scores all over the country.
FRANK
... I'm self-employed, I'm doin'
fine. I don't deal with egos.
I'm Joe the boss. What the fuck
do I need to go to work for you
for?
LEO
I'll lay it out. You be the
judge.
Go ahead.

FRANK

LEO
You don't look, you don't case,
you don't do nothing no more. We
point you to a score, we tell you
what's in there. When we tell
you it's there, it's there. They
are laid-out scores.
FRANK
How they worked up?
LEO
Alarm system diagrams. Blueprints.
Sometimes the front door key.
Sometimes the scores are in on
it, everybody's ripping off the
insurance company.
FRANK
Work cars, drops, tools?
LEO
Whatever you need, you'd see me.
I would be your father. Money,
guns, cars. I'd be your father
from here on out.
FRANK
What's my end?

LEO
You get a price. There is no
negotiation about the price. We
got expenses here you don't have.
You'll know the price up front.
How big?

FRANK

LEO
Boxcar. Nothing under middle six
figures. You'll make a million
dollars in four months.
FRANK
I go to work for you, I'm pulling
all this exposure.
LEO
Our protection trades that off.
FRANK
I take a bust...?
LEO
Turn around: there'll be a
bondsman and a lawyer there.
You'll never spend a night in
jail.
FRANK
Uh-huh...

I steal ice. No furs, no coin
collections, no treasury bonds,
no cartage, no stock certificates,
no precious metals. No nothing.
Just diamonds. Or cash.
Fine.

FRANK
I work with a partner.
LEO
We take care of you. A partner
is your responsibility. He beefs
on you, that's your problem. He
beefs on us, that's your problem,
too.

LEO (CONT'D)
He is never supposed to know
anything about us. Never bring
him around. He never meets me.
FRANK
Who are your inside people?
LEO
That's my end. It's nothing to
do with you. So what do you say,
Frank?
I dunno.

FRANK

LEO
Whaddya mean, 'you dunno'?
with me!

C'mon

FRANK
I dunno! I don't believe in
lifetime subscriptions. Maybe
this don't fit with my retirement
program.
LEO
What are you gonna do retired?
FRANK
Pick corn with the chickens and
watch daytime TV for the rest of
my life. What's the difference?
LEO
(cracks up; he
likes Frank)
All right! Two, three moves?
You wanna keep goin'? Fine. You
wanna split? Everybody's
businesslike; everybody's an
adult. That's fine, too.

So let me know. 'Cause you'd be

I hit the yard. Everyone watches

GARNER
(machine-gun delivery)
... and the nature of this
petition is that David Okla
Bertinneau -- pleads for Your
Honor to modify the instruction
on his 1958 conviction.

JUDGE RICHARD RAMSEY

is weary, respectable. Young lawyers in sharp suits
look more sinister than their clients. The bailiff and
three guards are overweight, weary ward heelers. It
says "No Smoking." Everyone smokes. Now the Judge
rests his face in his outspread hands with only the
thumbs tucked in under his jaw. Eight fingers are
VISIBLE.
JUDGE RAMSEY
But he committed numerous
offenses, violating property
rights of many individuals...

GARNER

rests his face on two fingers of each hand on his face:
four altogether. The Judge still has eight fingers up.

GARNER
That distresses me, Your Honor.
This man...

GUIDO

from the Vehicle Bureau -- bald, avuncular, middleaged -- finds Frank and sits behind him.
GUIDO

age, and suffers from

Guido passes licenses.

whispers)
What I owe ya?
GUIDO
Thirty dollars for the

GARNER (O.S.)
... knowing him as I

years in incarceration
and has become a
different person...

Frank peels off five 100-dollar bills, rolls them into
a cylinder and passes them to Guido. Meanwhile:

JUDGE RICHARD RAMSEY

rests his face on six fingers.
I don't know.

JUDGE RAMSEY
I remain unconvinced...

GUIDO

Judge Ramsey)
What are they? Picking their
noses up there?

FRANK

I want to hear this.

Now the Judge waves a hand meaning:

It means $6,000.

Frank!

BARRY

Carl relaxes; then:
BARRY
(continuing)
...You're set up!
And Barry breaks away, knocking over Richard as...

FRANK'S

gun comes up, alert.

CARL
FIRES blowing Barry into Frank's line of vision.

on the floor his head near a drain. Blood, swill and
other liquids flush into it from a constant hosing
mechanism. Frank looks up.

WIDE

There are seven men in the room. Leo in a stained coat.
Mitch, Attaglia, Carl, Larry and two 300 pound black men.
Bumpers are on a motorized track of clips that take them
through acid sprays and into electro-plating vats. Barely
we SEE one bumper's not a bumper. It's a man. The
figure's obscured by the assembly line.
Attaglia's blase. He wipes a speck from the side of
his nose. He'd love to lean all over Frank.

Look.

LEO
(to Frank)

Frank looks. We REALIZE the form is Barry. Frank
looks away. Leo grabs his face. Mitch helps. The
two men wrestle Frank's face around.

LEO

I said fucking look at him! Look
what happened to your friend.
'Cause you gotta go against the
way things go down. What's wrong
with you?
(pause)
You carry a piece in my house?!
You one of those burned-out
demolished whackos in the joint?
You're scarey. 'Cause you don't
give a fuck!

Leo kicks Frank in the back of the neck.
LEO
(continuing)
But don't come on to me now with
your jailhouse bullshit!
Frank doesn't answer.

Leo kicks him again.

LEO
(continuing)
'Cause you're not that guy! Don't
you get it, you prick? You got
a home. Cars! Businesses! Family!
And I own the paper on your whole
fucking life.
(beat)
I'll put your cunt wife onna street
to be fucked inna ass by niggers
and Puerto Ricans. Your kid's
mine 'cause I bought it. You got
him on loan. He's leased. You're
renting him.
Frank:

it sinks in.

Leo watches it.

LEO
(continuing)
I'll whack out your whole fucking
family. I'll grind 'em into
hamburger. People'll be eating
'em for lunch tomorrow in their
Wimpy burgers and not know it!
Frank doesn't talk.

LEO
(continuing)
You get paid when I say. You do
what I say. I run you. There is no discussion. You go nowhere. I want, you
will work till you are burned out, busted
or dead. You get it? You got responsibilities. Tighten up and do it.

Frank doesn't say one word.
LEO
(continuing; looking
at Frank, but to two
black heavies)
Clean this mess up.
One flips a switch. A heavy electric MOTOR WHINES to
life. The line of bumpers and Barry jerks in slow
progress towards the acid baths. Leo takes off the
work coat. Frank has moved not at all. He said
nothing.
LEO
(continuing; to Frank)
Get him outta here. Back to
work, Frank.
Barry is about to be processed through the acid baths.
Anything is possible. Leo leaves. Barry disappears
into the machinery...

Frank is in the bathtub, clothes dumped on the floor.

JESSIE
Where are we going?!

"We" are not going.

You are going.

JESSIE

When will you come?
Frank's pulling white shoe boxes of money out of the
closet.
FRANK

I am not. You will work out where
you go with Joseph. I can't know.
I won't know.
(two shoe boxes)
Here's $410,000 here.
She throws them on the bed, spilling bills. Frank -not missing a beat -- picks them up -- recovers the
boxes.
JESSIE
We just disassemble it?! And put
it back in the box! Like some
erector set and send it back to

Frank looks lost, walks out.

HOLD ON Jessie; desolated.
CUT TO:

EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE, REAR YARD - FRANK

almost lost in shadow in the f.g. He sits on the grass
in his suede windbreaker. The rear door opens. Yellow
light bleeds out. O.S. a CAR DOOR CLOSES, a CAR STARTS.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - CRANE:

JOSEPH'S CAR

pulling away down the street with Jessie and children
inside. As an afterthought she turns her seat to look
at the house. CRANE UP AND WIDEN. No one's there.

EXT. REAR YARD - OVERHEAD - FRANK

laying on his back under his trees watching them RUSTLE
in the breeze. The rest of planet Earth is under his
back.

FRANK'S POV STRAIGHT UP - TREES

Frank's vision is lost in the stars. The BREEZE becomes a WIND. The TREES RUSTLE LOUDER.

WIDE - CRANE:

empty. Frank's gone. CRANE move DOWN and PULL BACK
slightly: Frank's: shadow's SEEN in the house. Rear
door is open. Yellow light spills out.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - WIDE

The same yellow tungsten light bleeds out from the
open door.

FRANK

walks through the foyer buttoning his shirt over a black
vest and carrying two shoe boxes. Relaxed. He does
not look around. In a smooth, easy manner -- as if
he cared not at all -- Frank lights a match, touches
it to a book and throws it into the living room.

INT. CADILLAC - FRANK

gets behind the wheel. His face lit with fine light,
he looks at the house. It is the image from the collage
the Frank put together during 11 years in his stone
cold cell. It is that dream manifested.

EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - WIDE ON FRONT - NIGHT

Frank climbs into and pulls out in the Eldo. As
it pulls out of FRAME CRANE DOWN and PULL BACK:
the house EXPLODES. Flames fill the interior.

TREES

EXT. GREEN MILL - WIDE - NIGHT

It's closed.

Frank comes out of the darkened interior carrying a
gym bag. He places it on the floor of the car. Bag

Cadillac and leaves. HOLD. NOTHING. The whole front
of the Green Mill EXPLODES TOWARD CAMERA.

Nothing. Then the Eldo comes around the corner,

two houses and crosses back yards, we DOLLY with him.

Then: FADE UP HOUSE SOUNDS including distant t.v.
then FOOTSTEPS.

ATTAGLIA

enters and crosses to the fridge, opens it, bathing
him in light. As he closes the door, he turns.
Frank smashes his chin up with his palm and smashes
the back of his neck with the gun. The fridge door
swings back open, lighting the crumbled body of
Attaglia, spilled milk and Frank: moving to clear the
den off the kitchen.

INT. DEN OFF KITCHEN - ROSA - NIGHT

Leo's 50-year-old zombie wife in her housecoat and rundown slippers, watches t.v. on the formica and chrome
kitchen table and turns as Frank enters, the .45 coming.
She reacts to it, not at all. She turns back to the
t.v.

Vince? Christ! What did you break?

Nothing. He pulls a gun, hits the lights and starts
toward the foyer.

INT. LEO'S DINING ROOM - FRANK

entering, moving. Dining room is west of foyer.
Frank opens shadowed corners, the .45 snaps to the
fire position, then down to orange. He breathes
heavily, as he moves to the west corner - the most
threatening...

INT. LIVING ROOM - LEO

inches out from behind the arch - east of the dining
room - and sees Frank's gun up to the west. Leo
darts back, trapped, in the living room by Frank's
method.

INT. LEO'S FOYER - FRANK

works the east corner of the dining room and moves
into the foyer. He works the space entering corners
obliquely and clearing walls at his rear. INTERCUT
HIS POV. At each dead area, the .45 snaps up into
firing position. Then down to see.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LEO

caught, moves into the corner behind the sofa, near
a lamp.

INT. LEO'S LIVING ROOM - FRANK

seen obliquely working the room with the .45 from the

Finally, there's only the corner where Leo is.

FRANK

moves through the arch, the .45 comes up.

WIDE

Leo FIRES a wild SHOT. Frank FIRES TWICE blowing
Leo against the lamp which doesn't break. Leo raises
the Magnum again. Frank's third SHOT kills him.
Leo's position is bent and grotesque; the fallen lamp
is lurid.

meanwhile struggles with side screen door and finally
smashes it off the top hinge, falls out and stumbles
across the side lawn.

FRANK

FIRES from a Weaver combat stance hitting Carl who's
knocked back. Frank speed reloads, FIRES ONE SHOT,
downing the Guard, Carl is bringing up the shotgun.
Frank HAMMERS ON TWO SHOTS into Attaglia as he's panning
back Carl's shotgun FIRES. Frank is knocked back, his
shirt shredded, he aims coolly, FIRES TWICE. Carl's
dead.

FRANK

walks away from the sidewalk. The shredded shirt reveals
the black vest. The heavy .45 with the hammer still back,
hangs at the end of his arm. His face bleeds where two
of the shots hit him.

TRACKING - FRANK

down the sidewalk towards the Eldo down the street.
Neighbors in housecoats and robes runs past to see
what happened. Most ignore him. One or two see the
blood and the gun and back off.
