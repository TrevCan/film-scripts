INT. SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON - CREDIT MONTAGE - NIGHT
A SERIES OF VERY TIGHT CLOSEUPS: a convict, FRANK
BEACHUM, is being examined by a prison doctor, DOCTOR
ROGER WATERS. We do not see his face until the end of
the sequence. Instead we see only the parts of his body
that are being examined, and from these we can tell that
he is black, well-muscled, and in his late twenties.

CLOSEUP of a clock on the wall:

10:17.

The face of LUTHER PLUNKITT, the San Quentin Prison
warden, watching the examination, and then looking at the
clock. Plunkitt is white, fortyish, and a little soft in
the gut. He's seen enough in his years at San Quentin to
be neither a pushover nor a martinet. To him, the exam is
routine, but he's also mindful of its significance: It's
the final exam before Beachum's execution in about twentysix hours. He nods toward a guard who is sitting at a
typewriter. The guard types.

we're done.

Then

CLOSEUP of Beachum's face. We see that he is young, and
that he might have been scary once -- might, in fact,
have been someone's worst nightmare. Now there's
something else in his face: a terrible weariness,
hopelessness mingled with the struggle against fear.
As the CREDITS END, the clock on the wall ticks to 10:18.

INT. GORDON'S BAR - NIGHT

The warm wooden interior is hung with lanterns and ads
for microbrews. At the bar sits STEVE EVERETT, a
newspaperman with the face of a smart-ass. He has wicked
eyebrows and a wicked smile. Everett is thin-waisted,
broad-shouldered, and muscular from lifting weights. He
is having a drink -- a non-alcoholic drink -- with
MICHELLE ZIEGLER, a novice reporter who is very young,
very alluring, and very ambitious. Her skirt is too
short, and her lustrous eyes gleam with the superiority
of the recent college graduate.
Well, fuck 'em.

Hey, it was good, Ev. You gotta admit.
Best stuff I've written in months.

Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the piece

'the media glorified Beachum's victim in

culture...'

Which created the very violence that
destroyed her! Exactly!
EVERETT
Alan shouldn't have killed it like that.
MICHELLE

Michelle laughs in spite of herself and gives Everett a
naughty look.

She lets him put his arm around her.
MICHELLE
Well, you've come to all the wrong

EVERETT

Not from where I sit.
For a moment they melt into each other's arms.
Michelle pulls away.
No.

Unh-unh.

MICHELLE
Not smart.

EVERETT
What's smart got to do with it?
MICHELLE
I gotta go. I can't do this. You're
married and you're -- I can't do this!
She gets up and wobbles out of the bar. Everett watches
her, more amused than sorry. He glances at the
bartender, Neil, who is just arriving with the drinks.
Neil shrugs.

Michelle rips through the windshield; the GLASS EXPLODES
outward. The GRIND of METAL AGAINST METAL, and then,
gradually, the NOISE SUBSIDES. The smoke settles,
revealing a hole in the windshield framed by a crumpled
steering column. The HISS of hot, leaking FLUIDS SLOWLY
SEGUES INTO...

BEACHUM'S POV
Green grass, sunshine, a small white house against a blue
sky. BONNIE, a pleasant-looking young black woman, calls
to him from the barbecue. In her hand is a small brown
object, which she waggles back and forth. From under the
sound of the mower, the COOING of a BABY. We LOOK DOWN
AND TO THE RIGHT: There's a plastic sandbox shaped like
a turtle, and in it is Frank's little daughter, GAIL,
whacking the sand with her shovel and cooing at her
father. Beachum's gaze returns to Bonnie, still calling
to him, waggling something.
BACK TO SCENE
BEACHUM
What?... Just hold on. I can't hear
you.
The sound of the LAWN MOWER GRADUALLY TURNS INTO a
CLACKING sound -- the sound of a TYPEWRITER.

Morning, Frank.

Beachum nods.
REEDY
Can I get you anything?

Some breakfast?

Beachum sags, pulls himself up, struggles to answer.

Some coffee?

INT. OAKLAND TRIBUNE - PRESSROOM - MORNING

14

We're in the bowels of the building. Two large presses
crank out the next edition. It's hot and noisy and dirty
down here, just the way ALAN MANN likes it. Alan emerges
from the cafeteria carrying an extra large Styrofoam cup
of coffee. He stops to schmooze with the guys who run
the presses -- newspaper guys, ink-stained and tough.
Alan is tall and broad-shouldered, with a belly that
hangs over his belt; he looks like an athlete gone to
seed. He's the newspaper's editor-in-chief.
BOB FINDLEY, the city editor, is younger and softer. As
he approaches Alan, he is wearing a neatly-pressed pink
shirt and a cheerful tie; no jacket. Bob composes his
face and takes a deep breath. He prides himself on being
caring. Just now, he has the look of a man who is about
to impart some serious news.
You hear?
Yeah.
What a tragedy.

A large, chaotic open space partitioned into smaller
cubicles. Alan crosses the city section where a handful
of reporters are making phone calls and pecking away at
computer keyboards. Bob follows, a few paces behind.
BOB
I don't know if the warden'll go for a
replacement on the interview with
Beachum. But I thought I'd take Harvey
off the fraud meeting and -ALAN
Put Everett on it.

BOB
Uh, Steve's got the day off.

ALAN
Not any more he hasn't. He can do the
interview, then he can witness the
execution. What's-his-face, the warden

Steve's dealt with him before. I can

ALAN
You're wrong. He is an asshole. Trust

good at their jobs are assholes, Bob.
Alan plunks himself into his seat, reaches into his
inside coat pocket, and removes a packet of crumb cake,
which he slams down on the desk as though making a
declaration. He opens his coffee and looks up
expectantly at Bob.
BOB
(earnestly)
I know that, Alan. It's just, Everett
thinks everything's a big investigative
witch hunt. Like on that Mike Vargas
piece -ALAN
He was a drunk then. He's not now.
BOB
Right. Two months ago he was a drunk,
now he's sober -- if you say so, Alan.
Anyway, that's beside the point. The
point is, this isn't a Steve Everett
slash-and-burn job. It's a sidebar.
It's an issue piece.

Ooh!

ALAN
(wide-eyed)

Well, dog my

ALAN
Let me tell you something, Bob. Issues
are the shit we make up to give us an
excuse to run good stories. Judge grabs
a female attorney's tits, that's the sex
discrimination issue. Nine-year-old
kills his brother with an Uzi, that's
the child violence issue. People want
to read about sex organs and blood. We
make up issues so they don't have to
feel too nasty about it.
BOB
I guess I should call Steve Everett
then. Because that's his attitude
exactly.
ALAN
(leaning back)
Bob, you've been here, what? Three
months now? I've been working with
Steve Everett for three and a half
years, and let me tell you something:
The guy is good, as good as I've ever
seen. You know why he was kicked out of
New York? You know the story?
BOB
I've heard a coupla things.
ALAN
Steve Everett busted the mayor, Bob.
The mayor of fucking New York City.
Steve got hold of a secret memo on a
contract bribe between Hizzoner and one
of the ex-borough presidents, and he ran
with it in his column.
BOB
So?
ALAN
The paper tried to kill it, 'cause the
owner was in bed with the mayor. So
what'd Everett do? Didn't whine -didn't back down, either. He walked.
A long silence.

Butts fall into the bowl, and then we see hands using
toilet paper to wipe out the ashes. We hear Everett's
voice, as though he's talking to someone in another room.
EVERETT (O.S.)
Hey, I could have been happy in New York
forever -- They were about to let me run
the investigative team. That would have
put me on the Pulitzer track.
He finishes the job and emerges into the adjoining
bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

On the mussed bed, looking wondrously shapely and
wondrously naked, is PATRICIA FINDLEY, Bob's wife. She
watches Everett's approach admiringly, but there is
something sardonic in her smile. Everett puts the
ashtray on a bedside table.
EVERETT
It was a nice life -- Broadway shows,
downtown clubs, Elaine's every night,
veal chops up the wazoo.
He does a little dance, singing James Brown's "Got the
Feeling," playing imaginary maracas.
EVERETT
'Baby, baby, baa-by. Baby, baby, baaby. Baby, baby, baa-by.' 'Course, they
never served anything like this.
He swoops down and bites Patricia on the buttock.
PATRICIA

it better.

And while he's still kissing:

PATRICIA

are you hacking out Metro stories at the
Oakland Tribune?
EVERETT
Got caught in the supply room with a
seventeen-year-old desk assistant.
No!

PATRICIA
EVERETT
Yup. Turned out to be the daughter of
the paper's owner. Blackballed me all
over town.
You bad man!

PATRICIA
What'd your wife say?

EVERETT
(not without pain)
Well, we'd just had the kid, you know.
It was tough on her, but she wanted to
keep us together. And when Alan said
he'd take me on, I guess she figured,
you know, another town, another change.
PATRICIA
You bad man. First the owner's
daughter. Now the editor's wife. Do I
detect a hostility toward authority
figures?
EVERETT
Only the ones I work for.
PATRICIA
And is that what you're going to say in
the next city, with someone else?
(imitating him)
Oh, I got caught with the editor's wife.
You know how that is.
Everett gets up and begins pulling on his pants.
EVERETT

many other cities will have me.

EVERETT
You and me, Patricia, we're just two
simple people swept away in a whirlwind
of passion. Something like that.
Everett finishes putting on his shirt and bends over to
give her a kiss. Then he turns away, looking for his
wallet and keys.
PATRICIA
Look, it's all right. It's not like I
love you or anything.

Thanks.

She picks it up.

Everett makes for the door, blowing her a kiss and
mouthing a "bye." But Patricia holds up her index
finger: "Wait a second."

Plunkitt steps into the cell. Reedy stands in front of

prisoner.
Beachum sits at a small table behind a wall of bars. The
table is covered with several sheets of paper and a Bic
pen. Beachum holds a cigarette between two of his
fingers, sending a zig-zag of smoke to the ceiling. The
ash has grown long. It drops to the table of its own
weight. Beachum doesn't move his hand at all.

Beachum is eerily still, his eyes cast to the floor.
PLUNKITT
There're some matters I gotta discuss

get it out of the way.
Frank nods slowly, as if it were a very great effort.
PLUNKITT
Your dinner tonight, for one thing. It
can be pretty much anything you want.
Frank nods again.

More ash falls to the floor.

PLUNKITT
You go 'head and tell Reedy here when
you decide. Now, about your personal
effects and belongings -BEACHUM
My wife'll take 'em.
PLUNKITT
And your remains? Does that go for your
remains, too? Because if she can't
afford the funeral expenses -BEACHUM
No, no. Her church raised some money.
It's all right.

Okay. Now, I want to give you some idea
here of what's going to happen tonight.
We'll have to ask your visitors to leave
at seven P.M. You'll be given your
dinner and a fresh set of clothes.
There's a sort of plastic underwear
thing we have to ask you to put on. No
one'll be able to see it or anything,
but we need it for sanitary purposes.
We'll make sure it's removed before your
wife claims the body.
Plunkitt pauses and stares at Beachum's cigarette, at the
ash lengthening on the end of it. Then he snaps himself
back.
PLUNKITT
We'll come for you, oh, about a half
hour before the procedure. You'll be
taken into the procedure room and
they'll hook an E.K.G. up to you and
the intravenous lines at that time.
But nothing's gonna happen early or
anything. Right up until 12:01,
we'll be monitoring the phones.
We got open lines to the attorney
general and the governor, and those'll
be checked right through to make sure
they're in working order. You got
any questions about any of that?

No.

BEACHUM
(very, very quietly)
PLUNKITT
Now, there's just one more thing, and
then I'll leave you in peace here. It's
about the sedative.
Beachum stiffens. The line of smoke coming up from his
cigarette smears as his hand shakes.
BEACHUM
I don't want no sedative.
PLUNKITT
Sedative's completely optional, Frank.
I would just like to advise you that it
can make things a whole lot easier.

PLUNKITT
Fair enough. You change your mind, you

Beachum reaches to the tinfoil ashtray next to him and

As Everett enters, he sees Bob Findley watching him from
the city desk at the far end of the room. Suddenly
Everett is terribly self-conscious; every step feels
wrong. He walks, hands in pocket, as casually as he can.
As he reaches the city desk, Jane March looks at him,
looks at Bob, looks back at him.
Morning, all.

EVERETT
Heh!

He clears his throat.

Silence.

Bob stares at him.

BOB
You got my message.
Uh.

Yeah.

EVERETT
BOB
Apparently, it seems we have a problem,
you and I.
Everett's synapses go on alert, constricting the majority
of his favorite muscles. He waits. Bob shuffles some
papers.
Do we?

Michelle Ziegler was killed last night
in a car wreck.
Everett wasn't expecting this. The news knocks the wind
out of him. He holds onto the desk to steady himself.
EVERETT
What? Michelle? I was just -- I saw
her last night. We were... Fuck! She
was just twenty-three or something.
JANE
Dead Man's Curve.
EVERETT
Jesus. Poor kid. Just got out of
school. She was twenty-three or
something. I should have...
A long moment.

They all look away from each other.

BOB
(watching him)
Michelle had an interview scheduled
today with Frank Beachum.

What?

EVERETT
(still stunned)
(beat)
Oh, Beachum. The guy they're gonna
juice today. Yeah. She said she had a
seat for the show. Poor kid.
BOB
She also had an interview with him. At
four, face-to-face in the Deathwatch
cell. Alan wants you to cover for her.
EVERETT
(still stunned)
Right. Sure. Oh man! So... okay.
Beachum. Killed a pregnant girl or
something.

called Pocum's Grocery. Owed Beachum
ninety-six bucks or something -- repairs
he'd done on her car. He shot her dead.
Nice.

EVERETT
Anything special about him?

JANE (O.S.)
SERIES OF SHOTS

Raw and grainy, with a video feel, like something out of
the TV show "Cops." The shots are punctuated with
flashes of light, as though from police flashbulbs.
JANE (V.O.)
Came from Michigan -- broken home,
alcoholic mother. He'd been in and out
of jails, violent assaults, barroom
fights, drugs, more drugs. Did two
years in the state pen for beating up a
cop who tried to give him a ticket -EVERETT (V.O.)
Sounds like a reasonable young fellow.

Jane is perusing the file.
JANE
Nope. Get this. He still says he just

EVERETT
Nice touch.

JANE
Looks like Nussbaum had two strong

Black or white?

EVERETT
JANE
Uh, let's see. Both white, looks like.
Woman in the parking lot who saw him
running away. And then this poor guy
who drives in because his car
overheated, he goes in the store to use
the phone, and there's Beachum standing
over the body, gun in hand, blood all
over him.
BOB
Okay, okay, don't overload him. All I
want is the human interest, all right?
Death row, the final day, what's it

EVERETT
No problem. Uh, Bob? That's all you
need from me. Right?
BOB
(too deliberately)
That's all, Steve.
EVERETT
Okay, Bob. Hokey-dokey.
I'll get... right on it.

I'll be...

He turns and begins to walk away, pure relief on his
face. Then he stops. Something is bugging him. He can
feel Bob's eyes on his back. The smart thing to do would
be to forget about it. But something is sticking in
Everett's craw. Slowly, he turns.

EVERETT
Yeah. Uh... that witness, the guy who
drove in and then found Beachum standing
over the body. Well, he must have heard
the shots, right?
BOB
(much too softly)
The shots.
EVERETT
Yeah. I mean, his car is overheating,
he drives into the parking lot, gets
out, probably opens the hood, sees the
engine steaming, walks in the store.
See, if a shooting was going on all that
time, he must have heard the shots.
JANE
So he heard the shots.
A long pause. Bob stands very still, growing redder by
the second. His jaw is very, very tense. Jane watches
him like a bus passenger sitting next to a ticking
parcel.
BOB

Yup.

Everett turns on his heel. Jane lets out a long breath.
Everett zips back down the aisle. Jane nods at Bob and
follows him.

AT EVERETT'S DESK - DAY

Grubby, cigarette-scarred, littered with papers, Chinese
takeout containers, a picture of his wife and son, a tape
recorder.
Everett sits in his swivel chair, examining the Beachum
file on his computer. Jane appears carrying files and
disks and tapes.
JANE
Close one. I don't know what you did to
him, but he's on your case. I figure we
were about two seconds away from a full
Bob Findley explosion.
Everett grins, shakes his head, and reaches toward his
shirt pocket, half-pulling out a pack of cigarettes.
Jane looks at him in alarm.
JANE
What are you, crazy? You're gonna light
up now, after Bob's big no-smoking
speech last week?

Everett grabs Michelle's files. The first thing he
seizes upon is a tape cassette marked "Beachum." He
slams it into his recorder and stuffs the earphone in his
ear.
ANGLE ON EVERETT'S COMPUTER SCREEN
The Beachum file. As Everett listens to Michelle's tape,
he flashes to various photos and newspaper clippings on
his computer screen.
MICHELLE (V.O.)
Beachum case. Okay. Victim, Amy
Wilson, married, twenty-year-old coed,
shot in the chest with a .38 as she
stood behind her counter at Pocum's
grocery in Richmond. Six months pregnant
at the time; both she and the baby died.
Okay, let's see. Two witnesses.
Um-um-um-um -- right. First witness,
Nancy Larson. Housewife, mother of three.
Drives her car into the parking lot at
Pocum's...

IN EVERETT'S MIND - EXT. POCUM'S PARKING LOT - DAY

NANCY LARSON pulls into the parking lot, where she sees a
dark late-model car with the hood up; it belongs to a
smallish, conservatively dressed man, DALE PORTERHOUSE,
who is about to enter the store. Nancy pulls up to the
soda machine, leaves the ENGINE RUNNING, gets out, drops
money in the slot, buys a soda, and climbs back in her
car. She begins to back out but then looks in her
rearview mirror and SCREECHES to a halt. There, in the
mirror, we see Frank Beachum, running wildly, his face
and shirt covered with blood. (The mirror reveals him
only down to his chest.)

AT EVERETT'S DESK - DAY (PRESENT)

Everett listening to Michelle's tape.
MICHELLE (V.O.)
... Larson couldn't see whether he had a
gun or not. Uhhh, no weapon was ever
found. Oh, but she later picked Beachum
out of a police line-up, and that was
the same line-up, uh, let's see, where
Beachum was picked out by Dale
Porterhouse, C.P.A...

MICHELLE (V.O.)
He was passing through the neighborhood.
Car overheated, so he drove into
Pocum's to call Triple A.
32

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - PORTERHOUSE'S POV - DAY
He scans the store -- racks of food, food sale posters in
the window, and, above the front counter, a TV BLARING.
But no one, apparently, minding the store.
CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE
The door slams behind him.
BACK TO SCENE
At the sound of the SLAMMING DOOR, Beachum pops up from
behind the counter. His face and shirt are bloody, his
eyes wild. He and Porterhouse stare at each other, and
then Beachum panics and runs for it, scampering from
behind the counter and straight out a service door on the
counter's left side. As he goes, we can see him from...
PORTERHOUSE'S POV
Beachum's whole body is IN VIEW, and there is clearly a
gun in his hand.
CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE
Shocked and frightened, and not certain at first of what
he has seen.
PORTERHOUSE'S POV
He moves toward the counter, and as he does, we begin to
discover what is behind it -- the corpse of Amy Wilson,
her eyes open in horror, a hole in her chest, from which
blood is still oozing. Porterhouse's SCREAM FADES BACK
INTO Michelle's V.O.
MICHELLE (V.O.)
... Porterhouse calls the cops, picks
Beachum out of the line-up that same
day. Records later show that Amy Wilson
owed Beachum ninety-six dollars for work
he'd done on her carburetor. Note for
future essay -- why so few female car
mechanics?

Everett grins, shakes his head, and switches off the tape
recorder. He distractedly pulls his cigarette pack out
of his pocket. He stares at the screen. He types, and
we see the words: "BUT DIDN'T P. HEAR SHOTS?"
The Trends editor, BRIDGET ROSSITER -- busty and dressed
to show it off -- is walking by Everett's desk.
BRIDGET
Want coffee, Ev? It's back in fashion
as a late-morning pick-me-up.
EVERETT
God bless you, Bridget. Make it a big

BRIDGET
Women can fetch coffee in the office now
because improved job opportunities have

BRIDGET

EVERETT

He looks up at the clock on the wall.

Fuck.

It reads:

11:30.

EVERETT
(to himself)
He picks up the phone, taps in his number, and starts
lifting transcript pages out of the Beachum file. As we
hear the PHONE RING on the other end, he jerks a
cigarette into his mouth. He reaches for his lighter and
then suddenly looks up. At the other end of the hall,
Bob is watching him.
Everett's wife, Barbara, answers the phone.

They tried here but I wouldn't tell them

A long pause. Everett plucks the unlit cigarette from
his lips and starts leafing distractedly through the
transcripts.

DALE PORTERHOUSE: No, no idea at all.
BARBARA (V.O.)
Steve? I know it's work, but I really
feel it would be a bad idea to let her
down like this again.
He pulls the lighter out of his pocket and lights his
cigarette. A long drag. Across the room, we can see
Bob's face riveted to the spectacle of Everett smoking.
Everett snaps to attention.

Uh, Barbara? Uh, the thing is: There's
been an accident. Remember Michelle
Ziegler? You met her at Christmas.

But Everett is back to the transcript.

It reads:

Shillerman's WALKIE TALKIE, strapped to his belt, erupts
in a fit of SQUAWKING. He turns it down, but not off.
It continues to emit STATIC and DISTANT VOICES. Frank
lights his cigarette and draws deeply. Shillerman sits
down in a metal chair and slides it next to the cage,
leaning forward to encourage intimacy.

The car is brown and decrepit. One of its fenders is
rusted through, a taillight is secured by gaffer's tape,
and two hubcaps are missing. It is what is commonly
known as a shitbox.
Nevertheless, Everett is driving it as though it were a
Lamborghini. He has the window down and is banging on

The grocery is a one-story red brick bunker with a dingy

FRONT WINDOW OF POCUM'S
Just over a line of withering oranges and tomatoes, a
hand-lettered sign has been taped: "An Eye for an Eye!
Beachum has to Die!"
Underneath, a dripping syringe with a death's head on the
tube.
Everett raises his eyebrows.

He gets out of the car.

As he does, he accidentally kicks something that has
rolled from under his seat -- an old (very old)
cantaloupe. It sploshes to the ground and shudders there
for a moment. Everett makes a sometimes-I-even-grossmyself-out face, gingerly picks up the rotting
cantaloupe, and throws it into the vacant lot next door.
As it hits the ground and explodes, Everett makes a "bomb
exploding" noise with his mouth.

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - DAY

The market is a long rectangle with a counter at one end,
behind which sits a sullen, bloated woman in a bulging
white T-shirt. The grocery racks are perpendicular to
the counter, and above the counter a television is
blaring. Everett stands for a moment, wiping his
cantaloupe-tainted hand against his pants. On the TV
screen, a reporter is doing a stand-up outside the San
Quentin prison walls, talking about the somber mood
there, the tight security, and so forth.
Everett strolls toward the counter, looking around.

Help you?

COUNTER WOMAN
(to Everett)
He gives her his handsome guy smile, and, as he does, he
notices a button on her T-shirt: "Remember Amy."
EVERETT

was killed, isn't it?

wall, the service entrance to the left of the counter),
and the little entryway in the back.

EVERETT
What's back there?
COUNTER WOMAN
Bathroom. Mr. Pocum was always real
nice about letting folks come in and do

Everett nods, and for a moment he is at a loss.
EVERETT
Well, thanks a bunch. I'm gonna come
back one of these days and do some
serious shopping.
COUNTER WOMAN
Am I gonna be in the newspaper?
Everett doesn't answer. He's just spotted something on
the floor to the side of the counter, and now he crouches
down for a better look.
EVERETT'S POV
On the floor, the kind of white outlines that might have
been left in the linoleum if a foot rack had once been

Nope. Good point. It's not part of the

Everett slams the door of his car as he gets out. The

watch: 12:50. He looks up at the small apartment
building where he lives. There, at the bedroom window,
is his wife BARBARA. She is young, elegant, even
beautiful, but she looks hurt and surprised, as if
someone had just slapped her across the face. She has
pushed back a white curtain and is watching Everett
approach. Their eyes meet. She does not smile. She
lets the curtain fall and disappears.

BARBARA
In the old days, I would have smelled
the Scotch. Now I just think you don't
give a damn.
Now it's Everett who looks as though he's been slapped.
He takes a deep breath and moves toward the living room.
There, in front of the TV, sits his 4-year-old daughter,
KATE. At the sight of her dad, Kate turns away from
her umpteenth viewing of Cats Don't Dance, and her chubby
face blossoms into smiles. She climbs to her feet and
runs toward her father.
KATE
Are we, are we, are we...

Kate!

Okay.

BEACHUM
LEESHA
Frank... I'm really sorry, Frank.
Beachum hands the phone back to Reedy. Bonnie watches
him, waiting for an explanation, her wet eyes still
hopeful. Gail bounces a look between the two as if
sensing an event.
BONNIE
Is there... anything?
BEACHUM
No. No, nothing yet. You know these
legal things, baby. Takes forever.
REEDY
Good news, everybody. They've found the

EVERETT
So what exactly did you see?
PORTERHOUSE
Look, I've been all through this a

Sorry. I can't seem to put it all
together in my head.
PORTERHOUSE
It's simple. I came in to use the phone
-- my car had overheated. And soon as
the door shut behind me, Beachum jumped
up from behind the counter.

INSIDE EVERETT'S MIND - CLOSE ON BEACHUM

We OVERCRANK, and Beachum rises from behind the counter,
looking bloody, looking mean. He stares at Porterhouse,
then runs out the door.
PORTERHOUSE (V.O.)
He was bloody all over, and he had a gun
in his hand. I guess he had been
bending over Amy, uh, Mrs. Wilson, and
that must have been when he took her
ring and necklace. Anyway, he got one
look at me and ran out of the service
entrance.

Shocked and dismayed. Now he runs over to the counter.
We hear his BREATHING. He looks behind the counter.

PORTERHOUSE
Well, my point was simply this...

During his next speeches, Everett pretends to be writing
in his notebook. Actually he is drawing something.
EVERETT
Can I just, do you mind if I just cut to
the chase? Didn't you ever have any
doubts? About your testimony?
Never.

PORTERHOUSE
Why should I?

EVERETT
You definitely saw Frank Beachum's face.
And the gun in his hand.
PORTERHOUSE
Obviously, if I'd had any doubt, I would
have told the police.

EVERETT
Ooh, boy. Musta been scary. He was
pointing the gun right at you?
Everett makes a gun shape with his fingers and points it
at Porterhouse. Porterhouse is a bit taken aback.
No.

PORTERHOUSE
Thank God, no.

EVERETT
Waving it high in the air?
Everett holds his hands over his head, bugs his eyes, and
pretends to wave the gun.
PORTERHOUSE
Of course not. He had it down by his
side in a very normal way.
CLOSE ON EVERETT
EVERETT
Well, how could you see it over the
potato chips?
A pause -- just a split-second.
Everett is staring into Porterhouse in a way we haven't
seen before: his eyes are like lasers. He's not trying
to spook Porterhouse, he's just looking into him, deep
into him, searching out the truth.
PORTERHOUSE
I don't understand. What potato chips?
I had a very clear view.
Everett thrusts his notebook in front of Porterhouse. On
the paper, he has sketched a rudimentary blueprint of the
store -- the counter, the two doors, and the potato-chip
rack that had left the white outlines on the floor.
67

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - DAY
The sketch segues into an OVERHEAD SHOT of the store, and
the CAMERA GLIDES DOWN TO the show what Everett is
narrating:
EVERETT (V.O.)
I mean, you came in, right? You saw
Beachum stand up behind the counter, and
you saw him run. But between you and
the service entrance, well, see, that's

door again, but this time the potato-chip rack stands
between him and Porterhouse: Porterhouse can see Beachum
only from the chest up. Plainly, no gun is visible.

more than you really had. Maybe you
wanted to be the man, tell the girls
around the coffee machine -PORTERHOUSE
(angry now)
This is absurd! You think I would
jeopardize a man's life to impress the
people in my office?
Everett looks at him, and knows that he has no real

Porterhouse's eyes.

surprised you didn't get fired on the

Yeah.

Everett takes a deep breath and rubs his eyes. He
visibly sags: Is this another Mike Vargas case? Does he
have anything, anything at all, to go on?

Everett sits for a moment, lost in thought. He is
staring at a photo of Beachum and a photo of Porterhouse,
and he is wrestling with his doubts. Finally he smacks
his fist on the desk, gets up, and starts walking toward
Alan's office.

Bob is staring malevolently as Everett strides toward
Alan Mann's office. As Everett passes Jane, she looks up
at him and then back down, shaking her head.
Inside Alan's office we can see the editor talking with a
very distinguished-looking, gray-haired man in an
expensive suit. This is HENRY LOWENSTEIN, the
newspaper's owner.
Everett knocks on Alan's glass wall, and Alan motions him
in.

Beachum's first lawyer was probably some

Well, only thing I want to say, I wanted

A loud sob from Bonnie, who is sitting on the cot.
BEACHUM
... 'cause I think everyone's afraid of
dying pretty much. I came to my faith
late in life, you know. I done some bad
things when I was younger, but that was
then, you know. Anyway, I know the
crooked will be made straight -- that's
what the Bible says, and I believe that.
Everett scribbles:

"crooked made straight."

BEACHUM
So that's how I feel about it.
He looks at Everett, but for some reason Everett can't
manage to look back. Everett just keeps staring down at
his pad.
BEACHUM
Is that all right, Mr. Everett?
Everett can't look at him.

He glances over at Reedy.

REEDY
You got nine more minutes.
BEACHUM
Is that what you wanted or...
Everett finally looks up, blowing a stream of smoke in an
unsteady breath. He leans forward, forcing himself to
look at this condemned, roiling man living out his last
hours -- the pain in that face, and the toil. Bonnie
looks up, watching Everett.
EVERETT
Mr. Beachum... You don't know me, Mr.
Beachum, but I'll tell you, I probably
got a screw loose somewhere. To tell
you the truth, I don't give a rat's ass
about Jesus Christ. And I don't care
about justice, in this life or the next.
To be honest, I don't even care about
what's right and wrong. Never have.
Everett drops his cigarette to the floor and rubs it out
with his shoe. Beachum and Bonnie are watching him,
mesmerized.
Everett taps his nose.
EVERETT
You know what this is?
BEACHUM
Is this some kind of joke?
EVERETT
It's no joke, Mr. Beachum. It's my
nose. And my nose -- well, to tell you
the pitiful truth, it's my whole goddamn
life. When my nose says something
stinks, I gotta have faith in it, just
like you have your faith in Jesus.

that woman or not?

BEACHUM

disbelieving)
EVERETT
What happened, dammit? In that store.
The day Amy Wilson was shot.
The two men stare at each other. We see that Everett is
looking right into Beachum, the way he looked right into
Porterhouse.

BEACHUM
You're not always gonna do me this way,

AMY
I swear it, Frank. We just had some
extra expenses, end of the school year
and all.
BEACHUM
It's cool. July fifteenth. Hey, I'm
just gonna use the bathroom, okay?
AMY
You know where, right?
Beachum nods and heads toward the back of the store. The
bathroom is in a small entryway, and as Beachum heads
toward it, we hear the front DOOR SLAM. Beachum
struggles for a moment with the sticky bathroom door and
goes in.

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - BATHROOM - DAY

87

Beachum is standing in the stall (it's a one-toilet
bathroom), humming to himself. We hear MUFFLED VOICES
outside, and at first Beachum doesn't notice them. He
finishes and FLUSHES the TOILET. Over the sound of the
flush, the VOICES GROW LOUDER. Beachum can't be sure
what he's hearing. Then he hears Amy's anguished
voice!-Please!

AMY (O.S.)
Not that!

-- followed by a GUNSHOT. For a moment, Beachum stands
paralyzed. Then he bolts out of the stall, pushes at the
sticky bathroom door, kicks it open, runs down the small
entryway, and emerges into the main body of the store.
88

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - BEACHUM'S POV - DAY

88

The door to the service entrance is slamming. There's no
one else in sight. Beachum runs toward the counter;
behind it, Amy Wilson is lying on her back, her eyes
wide, her chest torn open by a bullet, the last breaths
rattling out of her.
Outside, very distantly, the sound of a CAR DOOR being
SLAMMED, and then the SCREECH of TIRES.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Beachum falls to his knees by Amy's side, trying
everything he can think of, making up his own brand of
CPR as he goes along -- thumping her chest, breathing
into her mouth, trying to staunch the blood with his
hands, calling her name. Blood soaks his shirt,
splatters onto his face, runs down his fingers. Amy
looks into his eyes, terrified, and then her eyes go
blank.
Dimly, he hears the FRONT DOOR CLOSE.
Hey!

And a voice:

What's going on? Oh my God!

For a moment, he and Beachum stare at each other, and
then, for another split second, Beachum looks down at
himself, realizes how all this must seem, and bolts for
the service door. We see clearly that the potato chip
rack stands between him and Porterhouse.
89

He is RUNNING OUT the service door INTO a small
passageway full of garbage cans, fire extinguishers,
boxes and crates. OUT the outer screen door, RUNNING -and wham! Nancy Larson's car nearly backs into him.

Beachum looks up, and we see Larson's eyes looking back,
startled, from her rear-view mirror. Then Beachum runs
out of the parking lot.

Of course he didn't. 'Cause by the time

Bonnie sobs, but Everett ignores her. Beachum begins to
slump and look away, but Everett only grows more intent.
In the b.g., Reedy picks up the phone and talks anxiously
into it. He never takes his eyes off Everett.
EVERETT
So what was it, Frank, a simple robbery?
Who else could have been there? Come

Plunkitt accompanies Everett toward his (Everett's) car.
PLUNKITT
You know, people come in here, the

then the next day, in the paper, we're
the ones who come off sounding like hard
guys. It can get pretty frustrating, is
all.
Sure.

EVERETT
Of course.

PLUNKITT
We have to do what the state tells us to

murderers or anything like that.
Right.

EVERETT
I understand completely.

PLUNKITT
Knew you would.

You know, these things go through all

Okay, but what do you expect? Your

NUSSBAUM
One more thing, barfly. Just thought
you oughta know before your latest lost
cause confesses. Anyone ever tell you
that Beachum volunteered for a lie
detector test? Yeah. He flunked, big

why you didn't read about it in the
transcripts. Still, it kind of captured
our interest. Why don't you go pour

Why? Bob want you to take one?

buzzer. Everett monkeys with the credit card until he
hears a CLICK.
Only it isn't really a click. It's the SNAP of his
CREDIT CARD breaking in half. He withdraws it and
watches the other piece fall to the ground. His
flashlight jiggles on it for a moment.

Everett finds among Michelle's boxes: photos of
atrocities, notes about other murder trials, pictures of
chalk outlines, a bag of marijuana, etc. Dust rises in

The window slams shut. Everett waits for a moment,
wondering, eyeing the nasty-looking kids.
The door opens. Mrs. Russel is a powerful-looking woman
in her fifties. She wears a shapeless floral housedress
that ends at the shoulders and the knees, and she twists
a gold locket that she wears around her neck. Suddenly
she yells.

As Beachum goes into the entryway toward the bathroom, we
hear a NOISE at the FRONT DOOR. We WHIP-PAN TO the door,

can hear the bathroom DOOR OPENING. He sees the service

We see him scampering through the service entryway, out

car. The MOTOR is already RUNNING. Warren jumps in,
tosses the locket on the seat beside him, and PEELS OUT.

Everett has reached the door. He grabs the handle and

Ow!

Blood seeps down his brow and onto his fingers. Neil
notices him leaving and yells after him, but Everett is

Neil turns his attention back to the TV, and we PAN UP TO

remorse for the killing six years ago of
twenty-year-old co-ed Amy Wilson...

The door snaps open. Beachum bolts upright, his eyes

is sitting with his own pastor, REVEREND FLOWERS, who now
rises. The lead guard hands the paper bag to Plunkitt.
PLUNKITT
Reverend Flowers, I'm just going to ask
you to step into another room for a
moment, all right?
Flowers nods, nods to Beachum, and steps away. We can
hear Reedy in the b.g., typing the chronological.
PLUNKITT
Now, Frank, this is the change of
clothes we talked about. I'm gonna ask
you now to put these clothes on,
including the special underpants that
are provided for hygienic reasons. This
is required, and I have to ask you if
you're going to give me any problems
with this.
Beachum passively accepts the bag.
PLUNKITT
Good. Now, it would be wise at this

he spies the man he's looking for: the executioner, the

mounts the sidewalk, smashes into a garbage can, slips
back down into the street and comes to a STEAMING,
shuddering halt. We hear a DISTANT BELCH.

Everett leans on the BUZZER. He looks up. The windows
are dark. Everett looks at his watch: 11:32. He jams
the BUZZER AGAIN AND AGAIN, the frustration building in
him. Then he hits the door, hammering the frame with his
already-bloody fist. He kicks it. Finally he collapses
against the door, the wood against the blood on his
forehead. He groans, extends his arms along the wood,
and then slumps, the energy oozing out of him. One last
slap.

Plunkitt watches Beachum's face. It's the face of any
frightened patient on a gurney, looking to a nurse for
reassurance. To his chagrin, Plunkitt finds his right
hand trembling against his pants leg. He slips the hand
into his pocket and moves to a more private corner of the

Everett comes out of the mall, breathes in the cool air,
and lights a cigarette. Behind him and a few yards away,
the Santa Claus is plying his trade. The voice is
familiar.
SANTA CLAUS
Gimme some charity. Gimme some charity
here on toast. It's for kids. It's
official. Gimme some charity on toast.
Everett whirls. It's the Pussy Man in a Santa Claus
costume, his red-streaked eyes peering from under the
elf's cap.
Shit.

EVERETT
PUSSY MAN
Steve! You got charity! Now you're
famous, you're rich and famous, you got
charity money on toast.
Shaking his head, Everett pulls a ten out of his pocket
and gives it to him.
EVERETT
Take it, before my wife does. And get
out of here. Go drink yourself to
death.

PUSSY MAN
You got more money than that,
You got money on toast.

Everett glares at him.
PUSSY MAN
Okay, okay, newspaper man. I been out
here two hours; I'm freezing my ass off.
I'm going home.
EVERETT
You don't have a home.
PUSSY MAN
Hey, I got no wife, I got no elfs
neither. You wanna be Santa Claus these
days, you're on your own.
He begins to shuffle away.

Everett shakes his head.

EVERETT
I'm with you there, buddy.
rides alone.

Santa Claus

Just then he hears a child's voice.
Da-deee!

VOICE
Come on!

He turns. There, in the parking lot, is Frank Beachum
being pulled along by his daughter, Gail. Bonnie is with
him, laughing happily. Beachum suddenly stops when he
sees Everett.
Come on, Daddy!

GAIL
Come on now!

Beachum stays another moment, giving Everett a long look.
And Everett looks back intently, a bit the way he looked
into the eyes of Porterhouse, and Beachum, too, that day
in the prison. Then, slowly, Beachum raises his hand,
lays his finger against his eyebrow, then lowers the
finger and points it at Everett in a kind of salute.
Everett raises his cigarette and tilts it back at him,
and Beach laughs. Then Gail pulls him away, and Beachum
wraps his arm around Bonnie's shoulder. The three of
them go off. Everett smiles a deep, satisfied smile.
He tosses his cigarette into the gutter and walks away.
FADE OUT.
