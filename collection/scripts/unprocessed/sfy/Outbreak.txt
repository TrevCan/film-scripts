OUTBREAK
FADE IN:
EXT. JUNGLE
HIGH-PITCHED WHINES. LOUDER AND LOUDER. MORTARS race
through the air and EXPLODE in the distant jungle. Soldiers -- black, white, Oriental -- curse and mutter in
French, German, Australian and American as they reload.
COMPUTER KEYS POUND -- the letters leap across the screen:
THE MOTABA RIVER VALLEY, BELGIAN CONGO (ZAIRE), 1960.
THE CAMP OF FORCES LOYAL TO MOISES TSHOMBE - DAY
BLACK MALE NURSE
carrying a bucket of water from the Motaba River rushes
past the Mercenary Army to -CAMP INFIRMARY
Where he replaces the towel on the forehead of a feverish, delirious AUSTRALIAN MERCENARY with a cold new one.
AUSTRALIAN MERCENARY
Gimme somethin' for the bleedin'
pain. C'mon, mate, help me.
The Mercenary tries to lift himself out of his stretcher.
Can't. He's too weak. His skin is yellow and covered
with blisters that look like chicken pox.
NURSE
(checking the
soldier's temp)
He's still over a hundred and
six. Why can't we bring it down?
The black African army physician, DR. RASWANI, looks on,
helpless. Suddenly, the Australian emits a sharp cry.
His eyes roll back, and he begins convulsing. Before
Raswani can even reach into his bag for medecine, the
Mercenary is dead.
Raswani and his Nurse stare with horror.
The DRONE of a CHOPPER grows LOUDER as a Bell Z180 appears over the edge of the forest and kicks up a storm of
dust as it lands. Raswani and the Nurse run to meet it.
In their eyes, hope.

CONTINUED:
Two space-suited figures emerge from the chopper, their
faces hidden by thick green plexiglass shields. The U.S.
flag is emblazoned on the side of their helmets, which
also display their ranks. The much taller man is a
lieutenant whom we'll know as McCLINTOCK. Through his
visor, we can just make out his pock-marked, angular
face. The shorter, pear-shaped man is a CAPTAIN. We
can't see his features, only the reflection of hornrimmed glasses.
RASWANI
Have you brought the medicines?
Soon.

CAPTAIN

RASWANI
Why the hell didn't you bring
them?
CUT TO:
INFIRMARY
The two space-suited figures follow Dr. Raswani past
soldier after soldier infected with the same disease.
RASWANI
Thirty deaths yesterday, eighteen
the day before, the disease is
killing our men faster than enemy
bullets.
The Captain stops at a young AMERICAN MERCENARY'S cot.
He's shaking with fever. His skin is mottled and looks
like the pulp of an orange. His voice is a whisper:
AMERICAN MERCENARY
Take me home, Captain... Get me
outta this shithole. Please, I
wanna see my girl.
The American Mercenary reaches out with his arms to the
Captain, who shrinks back, not wanting to be
contaminated.
CAPTAIN
We'll get you home, soldier.
First, I need a tissue sample.
He pulls from his black bag a long metal syringe and
plunges the biopsy needle deep into the man's liver. He
places the needle in an aluminum test tube and seals it.

AMERICAN MERCENARY
Promise me you'll get me home.
Promise me, Goddamit!
A long uneasy beat.
CAPTAIN
We'll get you home.

TWO SPACE-SUITED U.S. ARMY FIGURES
boarding their chopper, Dr. Raswani and his Nurse
standing by.
RASWANI
Not just supplies, but doctors
and nurses. And suits like yours
to protect us. This disease
spreads too fast.
CAPTAIN
The plane tonight will bring
everything.
CUT TO:
INSIDE CHOPPER
ascending above the camp.
Lt. McClintock and the Captain look out the window at the
campsite.
McCLINTOCK
It's viral. There's no way to
stop it. It could spread all
over the world.
We can't see the Captain's face, but feel his remorse.
So can McClintock:
McCLINTOCK
If you'll excuse my bluntness,
sir, you can't go halfway on this
one.
CAPTAIN
Don't ever -- ever -- tell me
what I have to do.
CUT TO:

TSHOMBE CAMPSITE - DUSK
Dr. Raswani gives a shot to the American Mercenary, who
looks terminal.
DR. RASWANI
This will help the pain.
The Male Nurse rushes up.
MALE NURSE
They're coming.
AMERICAN MERCENARY
I knew... they'd come back... I
knew. Help me up. Help me -CUT TO:
RASWANI
ThE Male Nurse, and dozens of soldiers rush across the
forest to the makeshift runway beside the camp. In the
distance a camouflaged DC-3 is rapidly approaching.
INT. DC-3
The PILOT, no more than 21, sees the soldiers celebrating
their arrival down on the runway. His hand is on the
green bomb release lever.
I can't.

PILOT

McClintock is in the copilot's seat.
McCLINTOCK
It's either them or us.
He puts his hand on the green release lever.

Hesitates.

PILOT
You can't either.
ON GROUND
Dr. Raswani and the soldiers stare at the plane, coming
in too high for a landing.
INSIDE PLANE
McClintock squeezes the green lever.

CONTINUED:
The bomb cannisters under the wing open up, releasing a
thick cloud of yellow cyanide gas.
ON GROUND
Screams of agony rip out as Raswani and the soldiers
convulse and die.
The plane shoots over the treetops, spraying the ground
below like a crop duster.
Then the plane arcs and approaches again.
OVER RUNWAY
littered with the dead, the plane releases a waxy grey
cloud. One second. Two seconds. An eerie stillness.
The CLOUD EXPLODES in a huge inferno.
The plane releases more and more napalm, burning the
jungle for miles.
The CRIES of ANIMALS caught in the fire pierce the night.
Flames shoot up trees a hundred feet high.
PULL BACK to show the whole forest ablaze. A long beat,
then at the very LEFT CORNER OF the FRAME, a MONKEY with
a black and white coat (a Colobos monkey) emerges from
the fire, looks back at its mate, threatened by the
flames. The Colobos jumps up and down, baring its teeth,
SCREAMING. The fire moves relentlessly forward. The
monkeys dart to safety.
CUT TO:
MOTABA RIVER VALLEY - NEXT MORNING
A metal syringe burned to a molten shard lies beside a
mortar launcher, twisted and deformed like some bizarre
modern sculpture. PULL BACK to reveal acre after acre,
mile after mile of nothing but ashes and carcasses of
burnt-out trees. Not a single living thing remains.
FADE OUT and ROLL CREDITS.
FADE UP:
TREETOPS
A wind rippling through treetops.

Brilliant streams of orange and purple, the last rays of
the setting sun, dance across the sky and penetrate the
vapor cloud above the rain forest. Unworldly silence.

Betsy plays with a fat, round jackfruit, kicking it and
rolling it every which way. Her mother watches the
construction workers warily.
Morazu hums as he pulls a huge tree limb off the road and
into a thick patch of brush where he comes face to face
with Betsy. Morazu smiles. He takes a long piece of
sweetened bread from his pocket and lays it down right in
front of the young monkey.
Betsy eyes it warily.
MORAZU

Take it.

A long beat. Betsy takes the bread, examines it carefully, finally takes a bite.
Morazu grabs her. BETSY struggles, thrashing and SCREAMING. Morazu pins her hands behind her back. She spins

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTABA RIVA VALLEY (AUGUST 15)
Morazu gets off a bus by a small muddy river and walks
slowly toward his village of about fifty mud-thatched
huts. Pain in his back makes him wince. We see him UP
CLOSE: his eyes are red and his skin is pale. He's
sweating.
He stops at the village well and takes a drink. Other
villagers come up to say hello, and Morazu greets them
wearily, dipping his cup back in the water for another
drink. The villagers drink too.
DISCOVER in the background: the tribal medicine man, the
"ju-ju man." Streaks and circles of paint cover his
skin. He watches the excitement surrounding Morazu's
return.
CUT TO:
RAIN FOREST - LATER THAT NIGHT
A small group of Colobos monkeys including Betsy and her
mother run swiftly through the forest. Suddenly, BETSY
CRIES OUT. Her foot is snagged in a trap. Before her
mother can respond, she's pulled high into the air into a
bamboo cage. The DOOR SNAPS SHUT. BETSY SCREAMS in fear
and pain, hanging upside down -CUT TO:

The Colobos monkeys scatter as VOICES APPROACH, REVEALING

INT. GILLESPIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
FADE UP the VOICE of a MAN SINGING along with the GREAT
TENOR. CONTINUE PANNING OVER the room: the skull gives
way to a full skeleton wearing a star-spangled red-whiteand-blue bow-tie and carrying an umbrella over its forearm. CONTINUE PAST the oak rolltop desk.
MIKE GILLESPIE, about 40, keeps singing as he reads
through a lengthy typed report, making notes in the
margin.
LUCIANO hits a high C. Gillespie reaches for it... and
misses badly. DOGS WHINE O.S., probably in closer
harmony to Luciano than Gillespie. He's not pleased.
GILLESPIE
I rescue you from certain death
and instead of gratitude, you mock
me.
His two WOLFHOUNDS, Olser and Harvey, GROVEL on the floor
contritely, each with a worn shoe in his mouth. Behind
them we see the rest of Gillespie's living/dining room.
His townhouse is spartan; it needs a woman's touch. Unpacked boxes stand in the corner beside a treadmill.
GILLESPIE
That can't go unpunished. No
Letterman for three nights.
The dogs wag the running shoes.
CUT TO:
OLD CREEK PARK (FREDERICK, MARYLAND) - NIGHT
Gillespie, puffing, a weekend runner, strains to keep up
with the DOGS. They BARK excitedly.

CONTINUED:

Okay!

GILLESPIE
(reaching into his
pockets)
Okay!

Without breaking stride, he throws what look like sticks
high into the air. The dogs jump and catch the objects in
their mouths and race back to Gillipsie.
We see they're old stethoscopes with thick rubber tubing.
Gillespie lets them fly again. He laughs at their eagerness and keeps running, sprinting now, trying to prove to
himself that he's still young. Suddenly -- a PHONE RINGS.
Without breaking stride, he pulls a cellular phone from
his pocket:
GILLESPIE
(into phone)
Dr. Gillespie... How many dead?...
INT. BILLY FORD'S OFFICE (FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND)
Gillespie's boss, GENERAL BILLY FORD, MD, is a heavy-set
man in his early 60's with thinning hair, piercing, intelligent grey eyes and a warm smile. Scattered all
around his office are cages filled with frogs and reptiles. As he talks on the phone, he's feeding a greenhorned toad some dead flies.
FORD
Almost an entire village.

FORD WITH GILLESPIE

GILLESPIE

What?

FORD
How the hell do I know? I'm the
bureaucrat, you're the detective,
remember? All I know is State
wants us to lend a hand and when
the Secretary talks, I listen.
And when I talk, you listen.
You're Code Red. The plane's
leaving at 01:30.

GILLESPIE

Yes, sir.

Gillespie hangs up, out of breath... excited.
CUT TO:
EXT. GILLESPIE'S OLD BMW - LATER THAT NIGHT
Gillespie and the dogs pull into the driveway of a comfortable two story colonial home, passing a "For Sale" sign
on the front lawn pasted with a "Sold" sticker.
EXT. COLONIAL HOME
Gillespie knocks.

The DOGS BARK excitedly.

Who is it?

WOMAN (O.S.)

The dogs recognize the voice and jump against the door.
Mike.

GILLESPIE

ROBERTA "ROBBY" KEOUGH, an attractive, intelligent woman
in her mid 30's, opens the door a few inches, until the
latch LOCK CHAIN SNAPS tight. The dogs try to push
inside.
ROBBY
(smiles; delighted)
Hey, guys!
But when she looks at Gillespie, she's guarded.
GILLESPIE
Robby, I know I'm the last guy
you'd do a favor for, but I've got
no one else to ask.
ROBBY
My lawyer said not to talk to you
anymore.
GILLESPIE
Then just listen. I gotta go to
Zaire.
Robby shakes her head, "No, no way."

11.
CONTINUED:
ROBBY
Put 'em in a kennel.
GILLESPIE
So they can die of some weird
disease like Stripes did?
She mouths the word "no."
GILLESPIE
-- Look, Robby, if I had any other
choice, I wouldn't be here.
ROBBY
You should've let me have them.
You can't take care of them.
Beat.

Robby's torn.

The dogs nuzzle against her leg.

GILLESPIE
I won't be gone long.
ROBBY
You know I'm moving to Atlanta -they want me to start in four days.
GILLESPIE
I'll be back before that.
ROBBY
(sharply)
Four days is four weeks -- to you.
Silence.
GILLESPIE
It wasn't all my fault, Robby.
ROBBY
(quietly)

I know.
A long beat.

ROBBY
I'll look after them on one
condition: if you're not back in
four days, they're mine.
Gillespie doesn't like it.
Okay.

ROBBY
Hey, guys, c'mon!
They follow her in.
ROBBY
Guess what I got?
The DOGS BARK excitedly.
Damn straight!

ROBBY

She opens the freezer, grabs a couple of frozen bagels and
flips them to the DOGS. They catch the bagels and start
CHOMPING.
ROBBY
I missed you guys so much.
Gillespie hands her the note.
ROBBY

'I, Michael Gillespie, agree that
if I'm not back in exactly four
days from now, the ownership of my
dogs, Osler and Harvey, will go

ROBBY
That's stuff from med school...
Some of it's yours. I don't know
if you want any of it.
He fishes through it, shoving aside old medical books
and equipment. He finds an old wood stethoscope with
thick rubber tubing. He shoves in into his pocket.
GILLESPIE
Got a place yet?
An apartment.

ROBBY

GILLESPIE
The first thing you'll do is spend
the whole night unpacking...
You'll stay up 'til dawn but
you'll get everything in its
place.
ROBBY

Probably.
GILLESPIE
Nothin' in my life has been
organized since you left, Robby.
Beat. She's surprised at his admission. And uncomfortable. So's he. He continues searching through
the box and pulls out...
A photo taken during their honeymoon cruise: they're
both smiling radiantly as they hold between them a
trophy of a dancing couple.
GILLESPIE
Y'know, this is the only evidence
on Earth that I was ever graceful.
He checks her reaction.
Take it.

There is a hint of a smile.
ROBBY

GILLESPIE
Nah, people might see it... get
the wrong impression.
He drops the photo back in the box and moves toward
the door.

As we hear the front DOOR OPEN and SHUT, HOLD ON
Robby: a hint of regret.
CUT TO:
ANDREWS AIR BASE, MARYLAND
COMPUTER KEYS POUNDING: "Andrews Air Base, Maryland."
Flood lights illuminate a huge C5A transport plane
waiting on the runway, its nose cocked open exposing
its innards to the pouring rain. Several enlisted
men rapidly wheel equipment into the open hatch. A
private pushes a dolly loaded with boxes with the red
cross emblem up the ramp.
DR. ISAAC "IZZY" BERMAN, a short, bald Army Major in
his late 30's directs traffic.
IZZY
Blood in the freezer over the
right wing. C'mon! Gut it!
We're late.
The private grunts and pushes the dolly slowly up the
ramp. Izzy lends a hand, and the two of them run it up
the ramp.
Mike Gillespie, dressed in a uniform, climbs down from
the cockpit. Now we see his rank: Colonel.
GILLESPIE
Where the hell's Yaffe?
IZZY
His wife... she's due tomorrow.
I put him on leave.
GILLESPIE
We need him now! Who's going to
read the electron micrographs?
I will.

IZZY

GILLESPIE
You can't even read a Playboy
pinup.
IZZY
He said he'd get a guy to fill in.
We can't wait.

GILLESPIE

A Jeep drives across the tarmac, toward them and comes
to a park a short distance away. The Driver scurries
out to open the passenger door to let -General Ford get out.
IZZY
What does he want?
The driver pulls two suitcases out of the Jeep and
follows Ford into the plane.
FORD
I'm comin' along, Mike.
GILLESPIE
Sir, we're going into very
dangerous territory.
FORD
I'm well aware of the dangers.
GILLESPIE
Beggin' your pardon, General, I
don't think you are. You've had
only the most cursory training
on how to avoid contamination.
Concerns for your safety would
distract us.
FORD
Nothing distracts you, Colonel.
You won't even know I'm there.

Bullshit.

GILLESPIE

IZZY
All of a sudden, playing golf and
pushin' papers isn't good enough.
Damn, when I'm his age, that's all
I'm gonna want to do.
Gillespie flips a coin, covers it over his wrist.
Heads.

No!

Gillespie lifts his hand and smiles.
Fuck!

Gillespie pulls a lever and the hatch starts to close.
Wait!

IZZY

Mike follows his eyes out to the -TARMAC
where a BLACK MAN carrying a duffel bag is sprinting
toward them at incredible speed, like a ghost through
the pelting rain.
Berman swings the lever down and the hatch starts to
open but the Man doesn't wait for it to lower
completely. Without breaking stride, he leaps the
four feet onto the plane and slides to a stop right
in front of Gillespie. He steadies himself and
salutes:
SALT (BLACK MAN)
Captain Walter Salt reporting, sir.
Izzy smiles. He looks at Gillespie, who is impressed
but won't show it.
SALT
I'm sorry to be late, sir. I was
wrapping up some tests in my lab --- Strap in.

GILLESPIE

The huge JET ENGINES come to life. Gillespie, Berman,
and Salt strap themselves into the row of jump seats
along the fuselage.
Issy is filled with the excitement of a young kid who
can't believe his luck:
IZZY
You're not the football player
from West Point, that Salt?
The same, sir.

SALT

IZZY
I thought you had the Heisman
sewed up 'til you hurt your knee.

SALT
You and my mother, Major... I was
never that good. But thank you
for saying so, sir.
IZZY
Don't call me sir. The only one
who does that is the Colonel here.
Everyone else calls me Izzy.
Izzy, sir?

SALT

IZZY
My mother calls me Isaac, but I
hate it. I pitched for my high
school team. My dad thought I
was gonna be another Dizzy Dean.
So he called me 'Izzy.'
SALT
Yes, sir, Izzy, sir.
The plane surges forward and taxis down the runway.
GILLESPIE
I want to know just one thing.
Can you read electron micrographs
as well as you can run?
SALT
I'm not sure how to assess the
question -IZZY
-- Just say 'yes, sir,' Captain.
Whatever the Colonel asks, you
just say 'yes, sir.' That's how
we keep him under control.
GILLESPIE
Have you ever seen filovirus
infection in a human being?
No, sir.

SALT

GILLESPIE
It's about as pretty as goin'
naked up the middle against the
Dallas Cowboys.

CONTINUED:
SALT
I grew up on the South Side of
Chicago, sir. Whatever it is,
I can handle it.
GILLESPIE
I hope so, because if you can't,
you'll make a mistake. You'll
be holding a needle and it'll
slip. Or your glove will have
a crack in it and you won't notice.
You work with filoviruses, it's
like working with plutonium. A
single drop of blood can hold
six billion... That's more
filoviruses than there are people
in the world. You get a single
one of those inside you, you're
infected. Say you're lucky and
it's one of the few filoviruses
we have antiserum for. Then we
can treat you and you'll probably
live. But say you're unlucky.
And you get one of those
filoviruses we don't have an
antiserum for, which is most of
them. There's no medicine, no
cure, nothing we can do to help
you. Your body gets so hot, your
liver, your kidney, all your
vital organs melt, and your skin
turns into tapioca pudding.
Stunned silence.
IZZY
(smiles)
He means chocolate pudding.
Salt smiles slowly.

He likes Izzy.

The WHEELS come up with a THUMP. The giant jet shakes
and rattles and soars into the air.
SHOCK CUT TO:
TWO U.S. ARMY HUEY HELICOPTERS - DAY

Gillespie and his crew, the second is a gunship flying
escort. They pass over the wide Motaba River that
snakes for miles.

On the river: a Zairean Army patrol boat cruises downstream, looking for guerrillas. The machine gunner
swivels his cannon around at the two choppers.
The machine gunner looks up at the U.S. Army insignia
and waves.
INT. BACK OF CHOPPER
Izzy slips the clear helmet over General Ford's head.
PULL BACK to reveal:
The General covered from head to toe in BL-4 biosafety suit. Salt, dressed the same, looks on, amused.
FORD
(panicking)
How do you breath in here?
IZZY
(laughs)
With a respirator. Positive
pressure's what you want. Keep
those buggers out.
Izzy flips the switch on Ford's respirator, which sucks
air out of the atmosphere, filters it, and pumps it
into the suit. Ford starts to swell up like the
Pillsbury doughboy.
FORD
And I thought it was a hassle
wearin' a tie all day.
INT. FRONT OF CHOPPER - A LITTLE LATER
Gillespie, now suited up in full biosafety gear, but
holding his helmet in his hands, sits beside the
CHOPPER PILOT. In the distance, we see a village in
which numerous huts are burning.
GILLESPIE
We got a lot of equipment.
You're gonna have to get us in
close.
PILOT
I... I don't want to get no
disease, sir.
GILLESPIE
Then don't kiss me, Sergeant.

ground on the perimeter of the village.
INT. CHOPPER
Gillespie, Salt, Berman and Ford stand by the door,
ready to get out as soon as the chopper puts down.
Gillespie has to shout at Salt over the sound of the
WHIRLING CHOPPER BLADES:
GILLESPIE
Captain Salt, if you fail to
observe strict decontamination
protocol, three things can happen.
First, you can be court-martialed.
Second, you can die from this
horrible disease. Third, and
worst of all, you can incur my
displeasure. You got it?
Yes, sir.

SALT

GILLESPIE
If one of us gets sick, we all get
sick.
(turns to Ford)
And I didn't come here to die.
BURNING HUTS - WIDE ANGLE SHOT
juxtaposed against the U.S. Army choppers disgorging
the U.S. Army Infectious Disease Team -- blue spacesuited figures with the U.S. flag emblazoned on their
arms and helmets.
The ju-ju man remains high on the cliff above the
village, chanting and wailing, burning an offering to
the gods.
The U.S. Army Team approaches the village through the
smoky haze, and we see -Two different worlds juxtaposed -- men in spacesuits
and a man in a loincloth.
Gillespie, followed by Berman, Salt and Ford, moves
across the village which now looks devastated and
deserted except for a few remaining huts and a small
cinder block building with an old Volkswagen van,
marked with a red cross, parked out front.

There's no cough. Or we'd all be

If anyone got out, they are dead,

GILLESPIE
Finding the host is the only way
to control the spread. Our only
hope is that this is like most
viruses and that it has to live in
a host, an animal, to which it's
adapted over thousands of years.
And that animal host has developed
antibodies to protect itself
against the virus. If we can
identify that animal host, and
harvest its antibodies, we can use
them to fight the disease in
humans.
DR. IWABI
There are a hundred thousand
species of animals and insects in
this rain forest. The
construction worker could have
been in contact with any one of
them. Where do I start?

personnel supplies, whatever it
takes.

it. We've got to find the host,
Donny.

How? The San Jose animals were
all negative.

For thirty years you've thought it
was a breath away. And we looked,

carry the antibodies against the
African strain -- before it
mutated.

Nature is more generous than man,
Donny... it creates more
variablity in the antibodies. If
we find the host, its antibodies
may be effective against the
mutated strain.

time, no cure. We have no choice
but to implement the Emergency
Containment Plan.

Gillespie, Robby, Lisa, and Izzy peer...
Into the Brown Rhesus's cage. The monkey looks dreadful:
he's crouched in a fetal position and his nose drips puss.
SALT
He's dying of Motaba. His blood
doesn't have any protective
antibodies. Nothing.
Gloom and defeat sink over the room.
ROBBY
But where did this monkey get the
disease?
LISA ARONSON
Christ, it could have been
anywhere... Maybe he was on a boat
from Africa, next to the host.
IZZY
Then there's no hope.

No. Unless Jimbo Scott had close

animal is somehow traceable.
There's got to be something at

The big board -- a computerized map of the Quarantine
Area.
DR. FRANKLE, a Biowar Defense expert, an intense, bearded
man of about 50 -- paces in front of the big board. As
Frankle briefs Ford and McClintock, we literally see the
epidemic spreading out from the center of Bonneville -more and more terrain is colored red each time the big
screen redraws. The red gets larger and larger, until it
comes within three miles of the Columbia River, which cuts
a big blue swath through the map.
FRANKLE
Mosquitoes are picking up this
virus. An hour ago a squirrel
with Motaba was trapped just three
miles from the river.

The best stuff we've got won't

one bug, one animal's going to get
through to the river. Worst case
is the virus penetrates the
ecosystem. Then we can't stop it.
FORD
There's got to be a way to deal
with it -FRANKLE
-- The only similar case I know of
is the Influenza Epidemic of 1918.
It circled the globe in two weeks.

Betsy hides behind a nearby tree. She's hungry and can't
take her eyes off the half-eaten sandwiches lying in the
kids' snack boxes.
Sean is distracted by a glimpse of Betsy and spills his
