Because you forgot on our tenth,
too. Remember I got you that beerof-the-month club thing?
JOHN
Yeah, that was great. The beer.
JEREMY
You thought it was gay.
JOHN
I didn't think it was gay, for
Christ's sake! It was beer!
JEREMY
Then how come you never get me
anything for our anniversary?
JOHN
Okay
what you said right there?
That was a little gay.

Oh, fuck you. Anyway, we've got a

Mrn hmm.

JEREMY
What's wrong with you?-This is the
Clearys!! They're an institution!
We've never crashed anything like
this! Five hundred single women.
Three live bands! Oysters!
Okay.

..

JOHN

Jeremy stares at him.
JEREMY
"Okay?!" See? This is what I'm
talking about!
JOHN
I'm tired, all right?! My feet
hurt. My voice is hoarse.
JEREMY
You don't care about this anymore!
JOHN
What are you talking about? Of
course I care!
JEREMY
At the Buckner nuptials, you were
in the corner, sulking!

JOHN
I w a s n ' t s u l k i n g ! I t w i s t e d my

JOHN
I g o t a c o u p l e of words mixed

up. Big d e a l !

...
JEREMY
A couple of words mixed up?! You
told the entire wedding party that
the bride was very lucky because
her new husband smelled like the
anus of the cobra!

JOHN
I meant.he had the power.. of
the...cobra! Okay?!
anyway I
managed to turn that into a
compliment, did I not?!

...

JEREMY
So do you want to do
Oh please
this or not?

...

JOHN
Give me the paper.
john grabs the paper from Jeremy and reads the announcement.
JOHN
(continuing; beat)
All right, well first of all, I'm
not saying it's impossible, but it
is going to require some planning.
JEREMY
There ' s my man. He's back. My man
is back!
EXT. CHURCH YARD - MORNING, A WEEK LATER
John and Jeremy are standing outside John's car in front of
a very nice old Catholic church on the Cape. They're in their
tuxes, both putting on their cufflinks, combing their hair,
etc. We see guests milling about in front of the church.
JOHN
Okay, let's do our pre-game,
JEREMY
What's to know? Big Catholic
wedding. Lots of rich fuckers. Hot
chicks. We can do this in our
sleep.
JOHN
Rule one: Always prepare.
JEREMY
Fine. What do you have?
John reaches in the car and hands him a folder

JOHN
A few articles on Secretary
Cleary's economic policy. Skim
them quickly. Also a roster of the
key family members. A glossary of
sailing terms. Sailing's like sex
to these 'people.
Jeremy looks over the folder.
JEREMY
(reading to himself)
Okay
Harvard
Kennedy School of
Government. ..Mom's big with the
charities blah blah blah. Three
daughters, one son, a million
foundations. Barf. Puke. Gag.
Okay. Got it. What1s our back
story?

...

...

JOHN
We're brothers from New Hampshire.
We're venture capitalists.
JEREMY
I'm sick of that one. Why
. don't we
be from. ..Vermont and..; and have,
say, an emerging maple syrup
conglomerate.
JOHN
Because we don't know anything
about maple syrup.
JEREMY
I know everything about maple
syrup. I love maple syrup.
JOHN
I love red vines. Doesn't mean we
should be the red vine barons,
riqht?
JEREMY
Good point.
EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - A MINUTE LATER
John and Jeremy walk toward the church confidently. They see
two men checking names as the guests enter the church. John
and Jeremy stop abour twenty feet from the cnurch. They see
men in suits with earpieces.
JOHN
I knew it! Secret Service.

he answered it. He said that at

another in danger, there is a
breaking in of a metaphysical

EXT. YACHT --- THAT AFTERNOON
John, Jeremy and about fifteen others are on the Cleary
yacht, a large expanse of boat, sailing toward Martha's
Vineyard. John and Jeremy stand at the stern of the boat.
Gloria approaches the guys.
GLORIA
Jeremy, sweetie, I'm making
lemonade. Interested?
JEREMY
Sure, sure..ThatUdbe great, honey.
She smiles and crosses away.
JEREMY
(continuing; sotto)
And could you put some heroin in
it? John, this is against the
rules! You've got a wedding and a
reception tc seal the deal.
Period. No overtime!
JOHN
Oh really? No overtime? Need I
remind you of the Chung wedding,
1997?

.

JEREMY
- P.11 right, look-JOHN
We finished the reception. I'm
ready to go home. Next thing you
know, you're dragging me to watch
you and some chick play mah-jongg
with her grandmother thirty miles
away at a retirement home.
JEREMY
I needed to do that, all right?!
JOHN
You needed to do that . . .ha.
JEREMY
She was into her grandma! You know
the drill!

John scoffs.
JEREMY
(continuing; loudly)
It was my first Asian!

The people.an the boat turn around and look at Jeremy. John
shoots him a look.
JOHN
Look, I just need some alone time
with her.
JEREMY
She's got a boyfriend.
JOHN. . .
They all have boyfriends. So what?
JEREMY
Okay. Fine. Get some alone time,
seal the deal and let's get the
fuck away from these people.
Sack walks over to them.
SACK
Gentlemen. Everything okay?
JOHN
Oh yeah. Fine.
Sack looks overboard.
SACK
Oh man, will you check that out.
A school of bluefish.
John and Jeremy lean over to take a look.
SACK
(continuing)
You know, these waters use to be
flush with bluefish. And then the
corporate polluters came in and
well, you can guess the rest.
After we, and I mean the National
Environmental Defense League under
my stewardship, got Massachusetts
to pass the Bluefish Revival Act-JOHN
Bluefish Revival Act? They were at
Woodstock, right?
Sack laughs insincerely. William Cleary ambles over, cocktail
in hand, and quickly looks overboard.

J e r e m y and John l i n e up i n a scrimmage w i t h o t n e r g u e s t s

b r o t h e r s i t s i n a l a w n c h a i r on t h e s i d e l i n e r e a d i n g .

John hikes.the ball to Jeremy and goes out for a pass. He's
being covered by Sack. John fakes like he's doing an "out"
pattern but goes long. Sack is completely fooled. John
catches the pass from Jeremy for a touchdown. John is
congratulated by his teammates. Sack fumes.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - A FEW MINUTES LATER
John hikes the ball to Jeremy. Sack rushes in, aiming for
John. He misses him and completely flattens Jeremy who
manages to get the pass off.
ANGLE ON: John racing downfield. He reaches out to catch the
pass, however Claire intercepts. She does a little pivot
dance to get around John. John mimics her wildly. She laughs.
He touch/tags her.
CLAIRE
Not fair! You made me laugh!
JOHN
No, it's not fair. Yet a lot of
things in life aren't fair.
He mimics her again. She laughs and looks upfield.
CLAIRE
Hey, is your friend okay?
ANGLE ON: A few people are dragging Jeremy's seemingly
lifeless body off the field. John runs over.
SACK
I don't know what got into me.
SEC. CLEARY
I do! Five generations of Lodge
family breeding. Hell, your father
used to pull the same stunt when
we were your age.
Sack and Cleary share a laugh. John rushes over to Jeremy
JOHN
Are you all right?
SEC. CLEARY
Oh he's fine! Hey, Jeremy, why
don't you sit out the next play.
Todd, come on in.
Todd looks up from his book.
TODD
You must be joking.

.-

SEC. CLEARY
It wouldn't kill you to play some
competitive sports once in a
while, would it?
Todd scoffs. Cleary rolls his eyes.
JEREMY
(grabbing his side)
It's ok. It's ok. Um, perhaps Todd
could donate a kidney instead.

. .

*

Gloria rushes over, hyper-concerned. She leans over him and
sticks her tongue half way down his throat. Jeremy jumps up
to get away from her.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Good, good. I'm better now. Second
down.
EXT. CLEARY FAXILY COMPOUND - A MINUTE LATEK
Different scrimmage. John is the quarterback. Jeremy hikes it
to him as Sack comes in to rush. John whips the ball quickly
to Jeremy who is pummeled and flattened by Sack.
SACK
Damn! What in the world is wrong
with me?!
SEC. CLEARY
Nature versus nurture, Lodge.
Nature always wins.
They share another overly-exaggerated manly chortle
SEC. CLZARY
[continuing)
Let's take a daiquiri time-out.
John walks over to Jeremy.
JOHN
You all right?

JEREMY
Um ... I may need you to perform the
Heimlich maneuver. I think I'm
choking on my own nuts. Do we get
to leave now?

No.

Randolph shuts the door, shakes his head and walks away.
JEREMY
Oh Jesus ...
GLORIA
Don't worry. Be won't say
anything. Now where were we? Oh

She starts to straddle him again.
JEREMY
It's like eight hours ago you were
a shy virgin. Now you're not
wearing panties?
GLORIA
(purring)
You do that to me.
She starts kissing him. He moves her off his lap.
JEREMY
Gloria, look, I'm tired. It's been
a long day. Not to mention that
your sister's boyfriend made a
smoothy with my nards. I'm not
exactly in the mood.

Fine.
She takes a swab of mecurichrome and stabs his wound.

Todd picks up a flashlight and shines it on a painting
resting on Jeremy's dresser. We see a surreal red mess
blotched onto the the canvas.

I call it "Tortured Scrotum." It's
sexual and violent. Sort of a selfportrait. I thought you'd like it.

the boyfriends a tool. But if

This is about love!

You've known her for a day.

They nod " p r e t t y good." From t h e back of t h e c h u r c h , Jeremy

JOHN

I do a n d l o o k , I d o n ' t know

Sorry Father.

(continuing)
But, C l a i r e , I ' v e made a change i n

Oh, you've got to be kidding!

SEC. CLEARY
Lodge, you're a tool. In fact, you
come from a long line of tools. I
suppose youlre maintaining the
tool tradition...but not with my
daughter.
Sack glares at Sec. Cleary, then bolts off the altar. He's
running straight for John but before he can get there, Jeremy
runs up from the back of the church and tackles him.
JEREMY
(to Sack)
Oh sorry, dude, I don't know what
got into me. I'm seeing a Buddhist
about it.
Claire runs up and hugs John. They begin rushing out of the
church.
JOHN
Tianks , buddy.
JEREHY

Gloria's noticed Jeremy for =he first time.
GLORIA

She runs toward him.

Todd stands up, runs toward a man in the first row and hugs
him.
TODD

There's total chaos in the church. John and Claire kiss. They
run out of the church.
