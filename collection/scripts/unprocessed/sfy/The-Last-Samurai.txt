A WHITE TIGER

Surrounded by dark shapes with spears. The TIGER's eyes
burn as he lunges at one tormentor, claws at another.
Suddenly, the TIGER leaps over them all and BURSTS INTO
FLAME.

THE FACE OF A JAPANESE MAN

Sits up INTO FRAME. He is KATSUMOTO. He has been
meditating. We will come to know him later.
FADE TO BLACK.
CREDITS OVER the FAINT SOUND of a BRASS BAND.
WINCHESTER REP (V.O.)
And now Ladies and Gentlemen, the
moment you've been waiting for...
Winchester, America's leader in
all forms of armament used by the
United States Army, celebrates our
Nation's centennial by bringing
you a true American hero.

INT. CONVENTION HALL (SAN FRANCISCO) - DAY

3

A trade show is in progress. Scantily-clad lovelies in
red-white-and-blue undies demonstrate the nation's newest
export: arms. Banners declaim the virtues of Winchester
and Springfield. Crowds mill around a stage, where:
WINCHESTER REP
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known. The
bloody cornfield of Antietam. The
stone wall of Sharpsburg. Winner
of the Medal of Honor for his
gallantry on the hallowed ground
of Gettysburg.
LITTLE TIN SOLDIERS line up in a diorama. A troop of
Union cavalry facing brightly-painted Indian Braves on
horseback.

WINCHESTER REP
He is late of the 7th Cavalry and
their triumphant campaigns against
the most savage Indian Nations.
Decorated again for his gallantry
in vanquishing the awful and
terrible Cheyenne at the Washita
River... Ladies and Gents, I
present to you: Captain Nathan
Algren!

A smattering of polite applause.
No Captain Algren.

The rep looks around.

WINCHESTER REP
Captain Nathan Algren!
(beat)
Yes!... Yes!
(still no Algren)
[Where is he -- ?]
(to the audience)
One moment, Ladies and
Gentlemen...
He heads behind the stage where he comes upon a man
leaning against a wall, half-asleep on his feet -CAPTAIN NATHAN ALGREN, U.S. Army, ret. The rep attempts
to awaken him, but Algren barely opens his eyes before
shutting them again. Next, the rep makes the mistake of
shaking him.
WINCHESTER REP
Hey --

Algren.

Algren suddenly and ferociously comes to life, grabbing
the man by the throat, terrifying him.
WINCHESTER REP
No... Stop...! Aaaaagh...
For a moment it seems possible that Algren might choke
the man to death, but gradually he comes to his senses.
WINCHESTER REP
(collecting himself)
Damn it, man, you're on.
...Right.

ALGREN
We realize he's drunk. The rep goes to straighten
Algren's tie and recoils at the whiskey fumes on his
breath.

The rep walks away. Algren takes a last furtive swig
from a flask, steels himself, then climbs onstage,
stumbling on the steps.
ALGREN
My thanks, Mr. McCabe... You're
too kind.
For a moment, he looks down at the rifle in his hands.
ALGREN
This, Ladies and Gents, is the Gun
that is Winning the West.
Only a few people are paying attention as he looks at the
little toy soldiers and Indians, then out at a man
holding cue cards, and haltingly begins.
ALGREN
... Many's the time I've found
myself surrounded by a swarm of
angry hostiles -- with nothing but
this rifle between me and a
certain... and gruesome death.
But let me tell you, folks, when
you need a friend, Winchester is
by your side.
As he tries to recall the speech, the little Indian
braves begin sliding up the metal hill. At a nearby
exhibition, a STEAM CALLIOPE begins to PLAY.
ALGREN
And make no mistake, the red man
is a fearsome enemy. If he had
had his way, this scalp of mine
would be long gone and it'd be a
balder man standing before you
today.
A nice chuckle from the audience, but as the laughter
dies, something has begun to change in Algren's eyes.
Nearby, someone starts RINGING the BELL of a STEAM
ENGINE, further distracting him. He departs from the
script.
ALGREN
-- Like those poor bastards out
there on The Little Big Horn.
Bodies stripped bare. Mutilated
and left to rot in the sun. Just
a fortnight ago.

The Winchester Rep

WINCHESTER REP
That's not in the script. What's
he doing?
ALGREN
The Seventh Cavalry, Ladies and
Gentlemen. Finest bunch of
troopers ever to be led to
slaughter.
And softly at first, then louder, Algren begins to
whistle "Garry Owen." At first the audience is
perplexed, but gradually a few of them begin to join in.
ALGREN
Come on, now... To the Seventh!
As the whistling grows, Algren begin to dance a little
jig.
ALGREN
Captain George Yates. Sergeant
William A. Curtis. Private Thomas
Atcheson, Corporal William -The audience claps in time to Algren's dance. In the
audience, one man laughs knowingly. His name is SERGEANT
ZEBULON GANT.
Finally the Winchester Rep has had enough, and speaks
from the crowd. [ALT: he steps up onstage].
WINCHESTER REP
-- Thank you, Captain Algren.
Thank you.
But Algren refuses to be moved.

However burnt-out and dissipated, Algren is a man

ALGREN

The terrified Winchester Rep backs away. Nearby, the
CALLIOPE BEGINS again. So does the BELL. Grimly shaking
his head, Algren reaches into his pocket for a handful of
cartridges.
Algren begins loading the Winchester.

The rep turns to

Oh, God... Is he doing what I

Un-huh.

the audience)
The Model '73 lever-action
"Trapper." 7-shot capacity. One
round-per-second, accurate at 400
yards.

audience)
Son, you ever seen what this can
do to a man? Why this beauty will
blow a hole six inches wide in
your daddy's chest.

member)
That's right, Missy. You'll kill
yourself five, six, seven braves

Winchester Rep.

Algren adjusts the aim over the heads of the crowd. KABOOM!!! Ladies scream. The calliope is forever silenced.

The incessant bell has been blasted into oblivion.

I thank you on behalf of all those
who gave their lives in the name

glimpse of his torment.

Mr. McCabe is here to take your
orders.

the gun)
God bless you all.
As Algren gives a small bow and starts offstage -- before
tripping and stumbling headlong down the stairs. Gant
shakes his head.

INT. ALGREN'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Algren lifts his head from the wash basin into which Gant
has forced him in an effort to sober him up. He looks
vaguely like a drowned rat.

advertisement for civilian life
I've ever seen.

ALGREN
I've been busy.
GANT
Aye. Appreciated your performance
today, especially the little speech
about the Seventh. Bastard got
what he deserved, you ask me.
ALGREN
Who's asking you?
GANT
You've got a gift for melodrama,
Nathan.
ALGREN
You're a critic now?
GANT
No, boyo, just a fella who's saved
your sorry ass six or seven times
and still feels obliged to look
after you.
ALGREN
Thanks, but it was me saved your
sorry ass.
They smile. Both have saved the other more times than
they can remember.
ALGREN
When'd you get out?
GANT
Six months ago. Already failed at
mining, bridge building, and
selling insurance door to door.
Even tried working in a bloody
store. Can you picture me selling
haberdashery to the ladies? 'Oh,
dearie, don't you look a picture
in that lovely print...?'

Bagley extends his hand. Algren doesn't take it.
Instead he gives Gant a murderous look.

So who would I be training your

Although offended by Algren's temerity, Omura is
eternally polite.
OMURA
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He is samurai.
Samurai?

GANT
OMURA
The word you might use is
"warrior." Katsumoto helped
restore the Emperor to his throne,
but he is now a traitor, and he
must be punished.

Mr. Omura knows we have experience
dealing with renegades...
Does he?

ALGREN
BAGLEY
He's even read your book.

This is a real opportunity, so

behind us...?

I did what I was ordered to do out
there. And I have no remorse.

EXT. SHIP (OCEAN) - DAY

A steamship churns its way across the great Pacific.
ALGREN (V.O.)
July 22, 1876. Twentieth day at
sea. Somewhere out there is
Japan.
Algren looks out into the endless waves.
ALGREN (V.O.)
For six months' work, I am to

pay. Could it be that training
Orientals to soldier is more

conscripts in my own country?

EXT. DOCK (YOKOHAMA) - DAY

13

The Yokohama docks are a frenzy of languages and looks
and smells and sounds. A series of rickshaws await our
voyagers. As does SIMON GRAHAM, a dissipated Englishman
who has lived in Japan for many years.
OMURA
Colonel Bagley, would you care to
join me?
Bagley gets into Omura's rickshaw, Graham smiles at
Algren.
GRAHAM
The hired help ride back here, I'm
afraid.
(offers his hand)
Simon Graham. I'm to be your
humble translator.
ALGREN
Nathan Algren. And Zebulon Gant.
GRAHAM
Welcome to Japan, gentlemen. Not
your Wild West, but I trust you'll
find it dangerous enough.

everything you can turn up on this
Katsumoto and his samurai.
GRAHAM
I'm afraid it's all in Japanese.
ALGREN
You're a translator, right?
The rickshaw sets off.
14

INT./EXT. RICKSHAW/TOKYO STREETS - DAY
In the bustling streets, white-face-painted geishas walk
alongside bearded Russians. Traditional Japanese kimonos
alongside European suits and hats; a schizophrenic world
of ancient Japan versus modern commercialism.
GRAHAM
Twenty years ago, this was a
sleepy little town. Now look at
it. For centuries this place was
sakoku, closed to foreigners -until one summer's day, out of the
blue, your Commodore Perry sails
in with his gunboats and politely
requests they open the country to
trade... or else he'll burn the
entire place to the ground. Their
whole world turned upside down in
an instant. Government collapses.
Men and women crying in the
streets. Even the mighty Samurai
couldn't figure out how to fight
back.
(smiles)
But they're very clever, the
Japanese. They hired people from
around the world to learn how to
beat us at our own game. I came
over with the British trade
mission, but I was soon relieved
of my position.
(off Algren's look)
I had an unfortunate tendency to
tell the truth in a country where
no one ever says what they mean.
So now I very accurately translate
other people's lies.

The army has shaped-up considerably. Gant marches them
in review past a pavilion where a garden party has
assembled to see them. They applaud politely. A brass
band plays Yankee tunes as Algren and Bagley, in dress
uniform, are being congratulated by DIPLOMATS representing
all the powers currently trying to devour Japan: Russia,
England, Germany, France.
DIPLOMAT
-- Marvelous, Captain. Such
discipline. We're all so thrilled
you're here. The entire diplomatic
community is talking of nothing else.
You must dine with us at the embassy.
Graham comes to Algren's rescue.

Monsieur Tarquin, forgive me, the
Captain is urgently required at

Algren watches a chef artfully wield a razor-sharp blade
in preparation of slivers of glistening, raw fish. Gant,
meanwhile, gazes unhappily at the live squirming eel
destined to be his dinner. Graham and Hasegawa sit with
them, cross-legged, on the floor.
ALGREN
The blade of that sword...
GRAHAM
Indeed, the samurai test the
sharpness of their blades by
practicing on corpses.
ALGREN
I've never seen an edge like that.
GRAHAM
Each sword is beaten and folded
and beaten a thousand times, and
then a thousand more.

skin doesn't come off all at once.

Gant uses his Winchester with deadly accuracy. Algren
uses his REVOLVER -- FIRING as he turns on his horse -when the revolver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber.
He parries the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past -And then the Samurai attack from behind! Soldiers flee.
Algren calls out orders but all discipline is gone -- it
is every man for himself.
Suddenly, a Samurai, wearing BLACK ARMOR, slams into
Algren's horse, sending both horse and rider to the
ground.

Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be
found as another rider heads toward him carrying a lance.
Algren wrestles the lance from his grip, throws the rider
to the ground, and runs him through. Gant SHOOTS another
who is about to spear Algren.
In the midst of battle one samurai, wearing a BLACK FACEPIECE, is just sitting on his horse. He watches Algren
fight.
Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as
they sweep past. He spears one and then unseats another.
When a third samurai cuts his lance in half, Algren uses
the remaining half as a club to take him down.
Gant, meanwhile, is slashed by the horseman in BLOOD RED
ARMOR. Algren sees his friend, dazed and helpless on the
ground, and tries desperately to fight his way to the
rescue. But it's too late. The Samurai dismounts,
raises his sword, and impales Gant on the ground.
Algren is attacked from behind. He whirls, just in time
to parry the blow. The Masked Samurai continues to watch
him. Algren fights with heroic passion, refusing to give
an inch, long after those around him have fled.
It has become a rout.

Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by
ashigaru!-- samurai foot soldiers carrying pikes. He
turns to discover his retreat cut off by other samuraiwielding katana -- the lethal long sword.
But rather than seek any quarter, Algren launches an
attack. He kills one samurai before he is STABBED in
the shoulder, by a lance.
In agony, Algren fights on. He parries a blow -- which
grazes his scalp. Blood flows down his face.
Algren is surrounded by samurai. A man's heroic stand
against certain death is of great interest to them. As
they begin to close in, Algren whirls the lance, a
tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still dangling
from the end.
The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE
MAN (MORI KATSUMOTO) whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed
at the beginning of the story. His eyes widen in
surprise, he watches his dream come to life -- the white
tiger holding the men at bay.

In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as the samurai in
the blood-red armor, advances. With a murderous smile,
the man draws his katana.
Algren seems spent -- he drops to one knee, swaying, on
the brink of losing consciousness. But as the RED
SAMURAI lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward
for the death blow -- Algren suddenly LEAPS UP and
propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into
the unprotected throat of his attacker.
As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in
to cut Algren off.
A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks. The Masked
Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside
deferentially as he looks down at Algren.
Sensing that he is about to die, Algren gets to his
knees, and tries to swing his saber, but like lightning,
Katsumoto draws his sword and cuts it in two.
Katsumoto looks down at Algren, who now awaits certain
death. Instead, Katsumoto barks an order. Rough hands
lift Algren to his feet.
As Algren is being led away, he sees samurai calmly
walking among the wounded, killing them with a single
stroke.
And then he sees General Hasegawa standing alone, his
sword sheathed, his head lowered. He is unhurt.
Katsumoto walks over to Hasegawa. A few words are
exchanged. Katsumoto bows his head in respect, seems to
agree to something.
General Hasegawa kneels and pulls out a small blade.
Quietly and with great ceremony, he opens his uniform,
then wraps a clean handkerchief around the blade so he
can grasp it, backwards, facing his belly.
Closing his eyes, General Hasegawa calmly and
deliberately plunges the knife into his stomach.
Algren watches, stunned, as Katsumoto arcs his sword
toward his friend's bowed head.
It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide.
Algren passes out, his wounds overcoming him.

Ujio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can
follow. Algren's sword is knocked from his hands, then,

around and cracks Algren across the chest hard enough to
knock the breath from his body and send him to his knees.
Higen's friend goes running off toward Taka's house.
Algren staggers back to his feet.

Algren is sprawling on the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's
sword out of his hand, and starts away.
Satisfied with himself, Ujio walks away, but the
expressions of the bystanders cause him to turn back:
Algren is standing again, holding the sword.
Nearby, Taka watches with interest. There is some
atavistic satisfaction in seeing Algren physically
punished.
Higen also watches closely.
The Silent Samurai merely stares at Algren as Ujio spins

head.

appetite for vengeance is not as great as she might have

Katsumoto is an enthusiastic actor. He plays to the
children in the audience. They are delighted with his
broad theatrics.
Algren sits back and takes in the fullness of the moment.
His eyes are drawn to the stars above, which seem
particularly bright at this moment.
Which is why he notices something odd -- a blackness
darker than the sky, the slightest shifting of a shadow
on a rooftop.
His eyes return to the stage, but something nags at him,
and he quickly realizes what it is: the guards are now
gone.
Quickly, he looks up into the darkness again, and now
sees more shapes, no more than the shifting shadows on
the rooftops.
He jumps to his feet -KATSUMOTO!

ALGREN
Several things happen at once:
Katsumoto turns at the sound of Algren's voice, and this
act saves his life -- as a crossbow BOLT WHISTLES past
where his head just was, into the mask of the actor
behind him -Villagers scream as -Arrows and throwing stars rain down on the unprotected
square -Algren has grabbed hold of Taka and the boys and, as
arrows thud all around, is propelling them toward Taka's
house -Katsumoto ducks down and rolls off the stage as bolts
riddle the platform area.

Algren pushes Taka and the boys into the house. A
samurai enters the house behind them, but is struck by a
shooting star just as he slides the shoji screen closed.
Ujio and Nakao, swords flashing, are organizing a ring
around Katsumoto, and they make their way toward Taka's
house.
Nobutada grabs his bow and is already picking off Ninja
from the rooftops -The ring of samurai around Katsumoto is also moving
toward Taka's house, but one by one, they are being
picked off -More Ninja have now appeared, this time on the ground -Samurai rush to engage them, and small hand-to-hand
engagements break out around the square -The circle of Samurai mount the steps.

Higen and Taka run into a corner. Algren places Magojiro
beside his mother. The Samurai following them is struck
by a shuriken as he closes the shoji screen. He falls to
the floor as Taka comforts Magojiro.
The injured Samurai manages to drag himself next to his
charges as an intruder is heard entering the house.
Algren swiftly turns ready to attack, only to see it is
Katsumoto with two more samurai.
They share a look as they hear -A terrifying SCRAPING sound from above -- like rats.
Ninja are up there.

In the main room, for one moment Katsumoto and his men

toward the kitchen area.

As Katsumoto and his men rush in -Ninjas EXPLODE into the house. Katsumoto's two
bodyguards are immediately cut down -- one takes a
throwing star in the face, the other is felled by a
ninja-to, a short sword ideal for fighting in confined
spaces.
Katsumoto dives and rolls across the floor. He instantly
kills one Ninja, and narrowly escapes the slicing blow of
another.
Another Ninja dives in through the window.

Algren dodges the sword and takes a sharp kick to the

floor, Algren kicks the table back into the Ninja's legs
catching him off balance.

Algren rises, catching the Ninja by the wrists, swings
him violently through a wooden screen just as a second
Ninja bursts through the paper shoji.
Taka quickly grabs the dying samurai's sword and plunges
the blade into the Ninja's stomach. Algren turns seeing
she has saved him and kicks the second Ninja away just
as -A third Ninja enters -Algren grabs the low tea table, lifting it up to avoid
the blade as the Ninja's sword LODGES deep in the wood.
Algren flings the table to the floor and kicks his opponent
in the knee. Algren tries to reach for a dropped sword,
but the Ninja is too quick and kicks it from his hand.
Algren throws himself, bodily, at his attacker. He
manages to grab him by the arm and flip the Ninja to the
floor. Algren elbows the Ninja and rolls, but the Ninja
grabs his head, forcing his face toward the blade lodged
in the table.

Katsumoto wields two swords. It is the first time we

More Ninjas pour in through the window. Katsumoto is now
facing four attackers. One of them hurls a throwing
star. With blind instinct, Katsumoto turns and takes it
in the meat of his arm. His attackers circle him,

moves toward Algren, but -Higen suddenly yells, appearing with his father's sword,
to distract the much larger man -Algren's attacker is on top of him, and pushing his face
closer to the blade. Finally, Algren's hand finally
seizes upon a chopstick on the floor, and he plunges it
upward into the eye of his attacker.
Taka rises lifting Magojiro into her arms.

as Higen rolls to avoid the body. The young boy runs
into Algren's room. Algren turns to help Taka and
Magojiro inside also.

Katsumoto is breathing heavily. His kimono is shredded
and bloody. He fends off the Ninjas' increasingly savage
attacks as Algren enters.
Algren SCREAMS, distracting them just long enough for
Katsumoto to take advantage and kill one.
Then, just as a Ninja is about to kill Algren, Katsumoto
FLINGS his short sword -- it pinwheels across the room,
hitting Algren's attacker in the back.
Without missing a beat, Algren pulls the short sword from
the dying Ninja's back and uses it stab another who,
thinking Algren defenseless, launches an attack.

Ninja JACKKNIFES as if punched by an unseen hand. As he
spins, dead, to the ground, we SEE an ARROW lodged
between his shoulder blades. Nobutada has FIRED blindly,
through the wall, killing Algren's attacker.
Algren and Katsumoto stand back to back, facing the last
two remaining Ninja. Their movements are instinctively
in synch as they work together to kill first one and then

Ujio helps dress Katsumoto in his exacting wardrobe as
Algren is ushered in by the silent samurai. He smiles at
the familiar, impassive, dour face.
ALGREN
Always nice talking to you.
The silent samurai is, of course, silent.
ALGREN
(seeing Katsumoto's

Excuse me.
Stay.

KATSUMOTO

Thank you for helping my son.
ALGREN
They're about to close a trade
agreement that will bring this
country more weapons than you can
imagine.
KATSUMOTO
Yes, if the Emperor agrees -- but
Omura knows the Emperor must
believe there is reason for those
weapons before he will sign.
ALGREN
And you are to be the reason.
Omura passes laws guaranteed to
start a revolt so the Emperor has
no choice but to take the deal.
KATSUMOTO
And my country is sold to yours.
Elegant, isn't it?
As Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body
is a battleground of old scars, so like his own.

Today the Council passed two laws.
The first law takes away our topknots.

Everything happens so fast it is hard to tell just what

Within seconds, four bodies lie in the street.

trench separates the Imperial Army from its goal.

A charging soldier thrusts his bayonet into Katsumoto's
arm -- Katsumoto kills the soldier with his short sword
but is awkwardly tangled with his body, a second soldier
races toward him for the kill -- Algren spins and
attacks!-- killing the second soldier -- but a third
races toward Algren, bayonet flashing -He dodges -- but the bayonet slices into his side -- then
Ujio appears like a black spectral figure to save him.
All SOUND gradually FADES and is replaced by the elegiac
sound of a BAMBOO FLUTE... The images of combat become
fragmented and impressionistic.
But no matter how bravely the samurai fight, they are
simply outnumbered...
Nakao leads the Ashigaru (infantry) to cut off the road
-- throwing the Imperial Army into confusion.
He is like a cornered bear, arcing his two swords wildly
around him. He is SHOT in the chest, and staggers a
moment. Another soldier SHOOTS him in the arm at pointblank range.

Nakao's sword goes flying, so the giant Samurai leaps
forward and picks up the shooter bodily, twirling him
around like a wrestler, throwing him finally onto the
upraised pike of a fellow Imperial soldier. But now
three more soldiers have leveled their weapons, and a
ruthless VOLLEY STAGGERS him again. SHOTS RAIN on him as
he tries to continue fighting, but his strength leaves
him. Finally, with one last lunge, he manages to pull an
Imperial soldier with him, crushing him as he falls.
More fall as Algren and Katsumoto fight desperately...
An Imperial soldier holds up a rifle to protect himself,
but Ujio's blade cuts through the barrel. The soldier
just has time to look at the gun in amazement before a
second sweep of Ujio's sword beheads him.
The tide begins to turn as Imperial Army soldiers run out
of ammunition, fumble with jammed weapons, cower before
the furious onslaught.
Finally, a bugler issues a call and they stumble back
through the defile in a disorganized retreat.
