EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

1

An immaculate pool -- clean, clear and placid -- crowds
the back yard, bouncing light against the house.
2

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - AT WINDOW - DAY

2

The pool can be seen THROUGH filigreed metallic blinds.
ROY ENTERS FRAME, suited, coffee cup in hand, and peers
out at it for a spell. A calming moment to start his
day. Then:
He raises the blinds, wincing at the floor of sunlight.
He checks the window's lock, re-locks it for good
measure, then closes the shade again.
AT NEXT WINDOW
The ritual repeated:

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - MORNING
Three doors line the left wall; one divides the right;
all are shut. Roy emerges from the nearest door on the
left (a bedroom) and shuts it behind him. He crosses to
the single door on the right (a bathroom), opens it,
enters, and shuts it behind him. WATER RUNS and a TOILET
FLUSHES.
He reappears, shuts the door behind him, and enters the
middle door on the left (another bedroom, unoccupied).
He re-emerges with a handkerchief in hand, then in
pocket, and a beeper on his belt, and again shuts the
door behind him.
He starts for the far door (to a living room) but manages
only a few steps before he stops, turns, and heads back
to the bathroom door. He opens it and peers inside. A
three-count and he shuts it again.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - DAY

4

Roy rinses out his mug of coffee, washes the sink basin
clean of it, wipes down the kitchen countertop, already
spotless, and lets the faucet run as --- he takes from a cupboard an unlabeled vial of pills.
Pulls off the cap, taps two capsules into his palm. And
just stares at it. Anxious and exhausted.
Then: He tosses the pills down his throat, chases them
with tap water, and gives the faucet a firm tug off.
5

INT. ROY'S CHEVY CAPRICE - DAY

5

Window cracked just enough to suck out his cigarette
smoke. AM-FM forecasts the natural weather, region-byregion.
RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
Elsewhere, temperatures in New
York in the high 80's, Chicago
reports rain, temperatures in the
high 70's...

EXT. STOPLIGHT - DAY

Roy slows to a halt behind a mini-van full of kids. They
laugh and scream and wave at Roy. His hands stay glued
at 2 and 10.
FRANK (V.O.)
No, ma'am, it's confirmed -7

INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY

7

FRANK MERCER, younger than Roy, works the phones. A sea
of papers floods his desk, while the adjoining desk
(Roy's) is pristine. In lieu of decor there are stacks
of cardboard boxes piled everywhere.
FRANK
-- the Chevy Blazer, the Paris
vacation, or the Tiffany necklace.

entering the contest, ma'am,
you've won -The next call -(CONTINUED)

sponsor's rep to fly in for the
final drawing. That should be

INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY

At his window, Frank watches Roy, frozen in his car.
FRANK
-- if you buy the Waterford II
water filtration system, the prize
gets recorded as a sales expense
and you don't pay any tax. Good
deal, huh?
Frank turns to one of the boxes marked "Waterford II" and
peels off a price sticker: $49.99.
FRANK
$398.00 even. You'd pay twice
that in stores.

You want to what? When will he be
home?

Mrs. Fisk, my supervisor just
stepped into my office and he
would love to talk to you. Can
you hold just a sec?
(puts her on hold;
to Roy, overly sunny)
Good morning. Something on the
radio?
(he offers phone)
Irene Fisk. 'Wants to talk to her
husband first.'
Who doesn't?

ROY
Roy declines Frank's phone, moves to his own. He plucks
up the receiver, cleans its mouthpiece with his
handkerchief, then un-holds Mrs. Fisk. The moment he
does, his whole personality transforms.
ROY
Mrs. Fisk? John Goodhew, regional
vice-president at Allied
Affiliates. Congratulations!
Which prize are you hoping for?
(beat)
That would be my choice, too. Can
I ask you one question, Irene? Do
you have grandchildren?
(beat)
Five! How old? Well, you're a
very lucky woman. Yes, I agree:
they are our most precious
resource. I've got a six and twoyear old at home and I'll tell
you: the day I installed a
filtrator... Absolutely you can
taste the difference. Now I
understand you'd like to talk to
your husband about this first, and
I understand why, but the thing
is, Irene -(confidentially)
-- my secretary is having a baby
this afternoon and the whole
office here is about to bug out
and go over to the hospital. Yes,
it's very exciting. But today is
our deadline, so you see...

Listening, Roy nods to Frank: she's in. Frank goes to
work -- calling a courier service on Roy's line (his
mouth grazing the receiver, Roy notices) -- as Roy
finishes up. And though his voice may be grinning, his
eyes betray him: he doesn't enjoy this.
ROY
Irene, that's sweet of you to
offer, and I'm sure she'd love
that, but we're in Chicago. Uhhuh, cooped up in our corporate
offices on State Street. I'll
tell you, though, I rather be out
in sunny California with you today
'cause it's just pouring up here.
Cats and dogs, exactly. Now let
me confirm your address for our
courier service...

Frank angles his foot up on the dash, and Roy points it

Roy moves briskly ahead of Frank along a sidewalk, his
hands thrust deep in his coat pockets, which he does
whenever he's outside.
13

EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS HOME
Door answered by a MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE. Roy and Frank
stand on her front porch. Roy presents identification.
ROY
Carolyn Schaffer?

I'm Agent Kellaway, this is Agent
Cole, we're from the Federal Trade
Commission. Sorry to disturb you.
We'd like to ask you a few
questions if we could.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

14

Roy and Frank sit at a breakfast table, across from the
Housewife and her HUSBAND. The Housewife gives her
testimony:
HOUSEWIFE
He said there'd been a contest,
and I'd won a prize. He said
there'd be a drawing in a week,
and I'd either win a trip to, um,
France or Italy, I can't remember.
He said if I bought one of their
products, their filtration things,
I wouldn't have to pay tax of the
prize.
She indicates a Waterford II installed on her kitchen
faucet, then wilts under her husband's stare.
HUSBAND
Jesus, Carolyn...
HOUSEWIFE
(penitent, near tears)
I was going to surprise you...
ROY
I'm sorry to tell you this, ma'am,
but you won't be receiving any
prize. And I'm sorry to tell you
you've been the victim of fraud.

Otis!

HUSBAND
(pissed, taking it out
on family dog who
scratches at door)
Knock it off!

FRANK
It's not the newest swindle in the
world, just new to some. They
bait you with something bogus,
then sell you something worthless.

ROY
How much did you give them, Mrs.
Schaffer?
HOUSEWIFE
Seven hundred dollars.
HUSBAND
Ah, Jesus, Carolyn...
(to Frank and Roy)
What's it worth?
FRANK
Any hardware store they're about
fifty bucks -ROY
But we've met people who paid
twice what you did.
(to Housewife)
You wrote a check, ma'am?
(as she nods)
Did you mail it to them?
HOUSEWIFE
A courier picked it up.

Roy and Frank exchange grimaces.
What?

HUSBAND
ROY
If they use the postal system,
it's mail fraud and we can go
after them. Otherwise, there's
not a lot we can do.
Unless...
Unless what?

FRANK
HUSBAND
ROY
A lot of these sons-of-bitches -excuse me, ma'am -- they work in
syndicates. If they cashed your
check out of state, it's federal
and we can act. But we'd need a
signed clearance from you for your
bank to run a trace on the check,
and then -(CONTINUED)

HUSBAND
I'll give you a clearance. If
it'll help get those bastards.
ROY
(to Frank)
You have any more of those L-47's?
FRANK
Maybe in the car.
(rises to go, by
chance feels inside
his pocket)
Wait, here we go.
Roy takes the form and lays it before the Husband.
ROY
Here, use my pen.
As the Husband's eyes glaze over the small print, the DOG
SCRATCHES at the door again.
HUSBAND
Let him out, will ya, Carolyn?
The Housewife slides open a glass door for the dog, then
returns to her seat -- without closing it behind her.
Roy's focus fixes on it. And every voice drifts into
the distance.
ROY
All we need is the name of your
bank, your account number and your
signature at the bottom. Any
luck, these guys were amateurs,
cashed your check in Nevada.
HUSBAND
See, darling? I told you: you're
too trusting. You gotta be more
careful of people.
FRANK
I'm sorry to say, ma'am, he's
absolutely right.
HUSBAND

uneasy stare)

Frank notices now, too -- Roy is sweating and uneasy,
fixated on the small wilderness outside -- and recognizes
the cause of his infirmity: the open door.
FRANK
Do you mind if I close this?
They don't. Frank rises and closes the glass door. Roy
snaps out of it. Sound within the room returns to normal.
ROY
I'm fine, thanks.
(he takes L-47)
Thank you.
Sorry.

Frank smiles to allay the Husband's suspicions:
fuck was that about?

FRANK
You're not taking your pills, are you?
Roy faces him, testily, but he never pauses in his effort
to get inside his car as fast as he can. Frank,
admonished, takes his time getting in.
FRANK
It's just that... you looked like
you were gonna whoopsy-daisy all
over those people's Oriental.

FRANK
You are taking your pills?

Yes.

The car pulls out.

ROY
If it's real money, it's long con.
I don't do long con.
FRANK
You haven't done it lately.

Frank is looking for a glimmer of hope.

Roy gives him none.

ROY
Without me, Frank.
Frank puts up his hands:

never mind.

FRANK
Okay. I'd just like to, you know,
take a girl out somewhere nice
once in a while.
ROY

You have to pay her extra for that?

INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT AISLE - DAY
Roy drops a half-dozen cans of Chicken-By-the-Sea on the
conveyor. The CHECK-OUT WOMAN totals them:

of Winston's.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Roy, shoeless, skirts the living room rug to approach a
ceramic horse in the corner, next to a sofa. He slides
its head up and off its body and rests it on the floor,
then reaches into its hollow belly to withdraw a .38. He
removes from his jacket the day's take and stuffs it
inside the horse. He replaces the weapon atop it.

Roy throws the leaves away in the trash below the sink,
then rinses out his coffee mug/washes down the
basin/cleans the countertop/lets the faucet run. Finds
his vial of pills and taps two capsules into his palm.
Sets the vial down beside the sink. Stares at the pills
again --- then throws them back in his throat and washes them
down with tap water (filtrated by a Waterford II). He
reaches to turn the faucet off --- and accidentally knocks the uncapped vial into the
sink, upending it and sending pills scattering.
Dammit!

ROY
He grabs for the vial, empty -- pills are swirling down
the drain -- then scrambles for the tap, slamming it off,
but too late: all the capsules have been swept away.

Roy frets, thinks, decides. Rolling up his sleeve, he
dips his hand into the sink's disposal, patting around
its base for pills.
At last, he finds one. Pinches it and raises it into the
light. And Roy knows: there's no way he'll ever put
that thing in his mouth.

Beside a door, a plaque reads: "DR. HARRIS KLEIN, M.D."
Roy watches from a darkened breezeway, smoking, hands in
coat pockets. He stamps out his cigarette and approaches.

What happened in the past I don't
care about.

That's a funny thing for a shrink
to say.

Klein smiles; Roy doesn't.
ROY
Yes. I was getting them
illegally.
Why?

So I wouldn't have to talk to
someone like you. Do you know
what they were?

Can you get me

DR. KLEIN
Yes.
ROY
Then let's get that prescription
pad out.
DR. KLEIN
Roy, usually I don't prescribe
medicine unless I've had a little
chat with the patient first. If
you're inclined against that,
then!-- as you say -- this session
will be quite brief.
Roy stares the doctor down.

Klein never blinks.

DR. KLEIN
It says here you're an antiques
dealer. How long you been in that
line?
Nothing from Roy.

The face-off continues.

DR. KLEIN
Would you like to tell me what's
been bothering you?
And continues.

Then, abruptly, Roy quits.

ROY
I get tired a lot, but I can't

me, make me feel sick to my
stomach.

Incorrectly, but yes. Anything

Dirt.

ROY
Especially around moldings.

Klein makes a note.
DR. KLEIN
Have these distractions affected
your work of late?
(off Roy's nod)
And your personal relationships?
ROY
What personal relationships?
DR. KLEIN
When was the last time you were in
one? A relationship?
ROY
A long time ago.

With a woman?
Five years?

DR. KLEIN
Ten years?
ROY

Keep going.

DR. KLEIN
You haven't seen her since?
No.

ROY
DR. KLEIN
You haven't spoken?
ROY
She left with a black eye, which I
gave her, and a bun in the oven,
which might have come from anyone.
So, no, I haven't. For all I know
she got hit by a bus. For all I
know she got rid of the baby,
'cause she'd been down that path
before.
(a breath to cool
his temper)
Doc: I spent last Tuesday on my
living room sofa. Watching my
carpet. Watching fibers on my
carpet. And the whole time I was
watching my carpet I was worrying
that I might vomit, and the whole
time I was worrying I might vomit,
I was thinking: I’m a grown man,
I should know what's going on in
my head. And the more I thought
about it the more I realized I
should just blow my brains out and
end it all, but the more I wanted
to blow my brains out, the more I
thought about what that would do
to my goddamn carpet.
(beat)
And that was a good day, Doc. So
gimme some pills and let me get on
with my life.

Klein studies Roy.
ROY
I was young, she was very young.
We met in a bar. Discovered we
both had similar interests.
Basically, drinking and -He waves his hand.
DR. KLEIN
Sexual intercourse.
ROY
If you gotta be dirty about it.
Then we got hitched. I don't
think either of us put a whole lot
of thought into it.
DR. KLEIN
And she got pregnant.

Hit her?

DR. KLEIN
Roy nods.
DR. KLEIN
Do you think about her much? What
could have been, what might have
been.
Roy shakes his head.
And the baby?

DR. KLEIN
ROY
If there's a baby.
DR. KLEIN
Do you think about that?
ROY
Sometimes. Rarely. If I see a
school bus or -- I wonder: Is one
of those kids Roy Jr.?
DR. KLEIN
He -- if he's a he -- would be how

INT. DR. KLEIN'S ANTEROOM

Roy waits. Dr. Klein appears from his stockroom/closet
and hands Roy a handful of unlabeled sampler packs.
DR. KLEIN
Congratulations. You bought
yourself a month's worth.
ROY
Doc, do you know of a way of...?
Just to find out...
DR. KLEIN
There's nothing wrong, Roy, with a
man telephoning his ex-wife.
ROY
I tried that last night.
(withdraws the
number from his
shirt pocket)
Couldn't say a word.
Klein looks surprised.
Could you?

Roy pushes the number on him.

ROY
Call her?

DR. KLEIN
I don't know, Roy. I, uh...
ROY
Just to find out.
Klein hesitates: This is unorthodox. But that's what Roy
wants. At last, Klein relents; he takes Heather's number.

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY

Roy's on the portable.
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
I just got off the phone with
Heather. We had a nice
conversation.
ROY
Does she want to talk to me?
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
No. She doesn't. I'm sorry. She
didn't understand it might help
with your therapy.
ROY
You told her I was in therapy.
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
I told her I was a psychiatrist.
I can't lie, Roy. Angela wants to
talk to you, though.
Who?

ROY
DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
Angela. Your daughter. She knows
you're her father, and she says
she really wants to meet you.
Roy can't move or speak for a moment.

Then:

ROY
Doc, can you hold the line a
moment?

Roy cups the phone. Carries it inside the bathroom.
Turns on the light and shuts the door behind him.
Through the door: The unmistakable convulsions of a man
puking up everything he has. Then:
Where?

ROY (O.S.)

MOVING SHOT
MOVING UNDER a highway sign:

SAN PEDRO.

Then DOWN TO: Roy's Caprice, Roy at the wheel, white
knuckles at two and ten.
48

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK - DAY

48

Except for one young mother and her infant, empty.
Stopped across the street, Roy checks his watch -- he's
early. He burrows out a cigarette, lights it, and
unrolls his window an eighth of an inch.
49

SAME SCENE - LATER

49

Roy is chain-lighting his next cigarette, then pushing
the old butt through the window crack, when in his side
mirror: A YOUNG GIRL floats INTO VIEW atop a skateboard.
Pretty but not fully formed, slender but not fragile.
She rides past his Caprice, then dismounts and walks into
the park.
Roy doesn't move.
50

SAME SCENE - LATER

50

The Young Girl sits waiting, rolling her skateboard backand-forth. Roy remains in his car, watching, amazed,
bewildered.
51

SAME SCENE - LATER

The Girl stands, looks this way and that, then gives up.
She mounts her board and starts away, and as she passes
Roy's car, he can see: there's disappointment in her
eyes.

Shit.

Roy throws open his car door.
Hey -- hey!!

The Girl stops. Roy stumbles out of his Caprice, clothes
disheveled, cigarette dangling from his mouth.
You Angela?
You Roy?
He nods.

ROY
ANGELA (YOUNG GIRL)
Father and daughter meet.

ON PARK SWINGS

Angela rocks gently. Roy stands nearby, on pavement, not
sand, hands deep in his pockets. He doesn't know what to
say, except:
ROY
You're fourteen.

So:
Yep.

ANGELA
She swings a little more.
ANGELA
When'd you get out?
What?
Of prison.

ANGELA
First she told me you were dead.
Then she said you might as well
be.
I'm not dead.

ROY
I'm in antiques.

ANGELA
That's what the doctor said. On
the phone. When he said that, Mom
started to laugh.
Roy glances about, anxious.
ROY
You -- you hungry?
(as she shrugs)
Do you mind eating? It's just -I'd feel better somewhere indoors.
I get uncomfortable sometimes
being outside.
She gives him a curious look.
53

INT. SAN PEDRO DINER

53

Angela is served an enormous meal (turkey, mashed and
gravy, chocolate shake), and Roy takes note from across
the table.
ROY
I thought you weren't hungry.
ANGELA
You're gonna get wet, might as
well go swimming.
ROY
What's that thing with girls -where they don't eat?

Anorexia.

ANGELA
I could have bulimia. That's when
you go in the bathroom after and

She continues to eat.

Roy studies her face.

ANGELA
You're staring.
ROY
Sorry.
ANGELA
That's okay. I used to do it,
too. Look at your picture and see
if I got your nose or your eyes.
Mom used to say I got lucky and
only got your elbows.
ROY
How is your mom?
ANGELA
Fine.
Roy waits: Is there more information forthcoming?
Angela eats, deliberately: No, there isn't.
ROY
So you're in school, right?
Not now.

ANGELA
It's summer.

ROY
Right. Well, school's real
important. If I had anything to
do over again, I'd work harder in
school.
You drop out?

ANGELA
Roy hesitates, then nods.
ANGELA
That why you ended up a criminal?

the dregs with her straw as she studies Roy.
You finished?

ROY
ANGELA
It's okay, you know. Whatever you
do. Everybody's done something
bad in their life -ROY

a lot of something strung together -ROY
Cut the shit, huh? I'm not a

What -- what was that word?
'Shi...t'?

When's the last time you saw each

ROY
Before you were born.
ANGELA
You still love her?
He doesn't know how to answer.
ANGELA
'Cause she still hates you, you know.
Yeah.

ROY
I pretty much figured that.

Angela leaps

Not just now.

Thanks, honey. Come back later

windbreaker, remove the white envelope, and drop it on

loose, whiskey in hand.

Hey, Chuck, I didn't know you were

wild-haired, impatient.
ROY
C'mon, c'mon.
A few customers look back at Roy. He stares their
glances away. Soon he can wait no longer. He pushes to
the front of the line, empty packet in hand.
ROY
Hi, I need a refill of this. I
don't have a prescription, but -PHARMACIST
Sir, please, wait your turn -ROY
I know, but this is an
emergency!-Hey, buddy:

That decides it: nobody's screwing with Roy. The
Pharmacist scans the horizon for security, doesn’t see
anyone.
Please.

ROY
I need a refill.

PHARMACIST

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Roy stirs awake, sweating heavily. The air conditioner
is off. The room is dark. The chair where the uniformed
cop sat is empty.
ROY
Hello!

Hey! Officer Maddox!
(off no response)
Could someone turn the A.C. back
on?!
Yo!

Roy reaches for a bedpan on the floor, to throw at the
door, but something rattles within. Roy shakes it again,
then pulls out: a handcuff key. Roy tries it on his
restrained wrist: it's a fit.
He releases himself, checks the door, then pulls his feet
off the bed. For the first time in days, he stands, a
little wobbly, in nothing but a hospital gown.
CLOSE ON ROY
as he quietly cracks open his hospital room door, and his
eyes go wide. Dumbfounded, he moves down a brief hallway,
peers into -ADJOINING ROOM
Empty except for the surveillance monitor propped up on a
chair. Coffee cups and newspapers litter the floor.
Also there: Roy's pants, shirt, jacket and shoes, thrown
in a pile in a corner.
Roy pushes on, through an exit door and steps out onto -168

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DESERTED ROOF - DAY

168

Blinding sunlight. Roy's hospital room resides within a
mobile construction-site trailer anchored atop the fivestory garage. A freeway passes in the distance.
Roy can't believe it. He staggers around the trailer, to
the roof's edge, and looks down. The parking structure
overlooks a largely-deserted stretch of Los Angeles.
Roy feels his bandage again. Starts to unwrap it. Then
pulls it clean off. Gingerly feels about his skull. No
stitches, no fracture, no bullet hole. Just one mother
of a bruise.

Cab waiting, Roy finds the front door locked, finesses it
open. As he enters, he notices Klein's plaque is gone.

Dark, until Roy turns on an overhead light. The place is
empty. Furniture and fixtures stripped, diplomas off the

Much as he left it. "Blood" stain on the carpet. The
head of the ceramic horse beside it. Roy reaches within,
extracts the only remaining item: a handwritten letter.

EXT. HEATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

182

For the first time, Roy parks in front of the house. He
staggers to the front door and knocks, running on the
slenderest of hopes.
A moment passes before the door opens, and Heather stands
before him. They share a long moment of recognition.
Roy...

HEATHER
He looks numb, glass-eyed.

He can barely speak.

ROY
She's not here, is she?

HEATHER
That's -- that's why you're here?
ROY
You were pregnant.
She nods.
ROY
You were.
Tears come to her eyes, too, a painful memory.
His last hope dashed, all the revelations of the day come
to a point, and Roy crumbles. He gasps for air, clutches
his gut, and folds into himself.
Roy, Roy:

HEATHER

Heather stands helpless before him, then slowly -because of their history, or despite it -- reaches out
and caresses him.

His salesman's uniform is not terribly different from his

least. Dark glasses and cutoff jeans. She comes
straight at her boyfriend, doesn't notice Roy at all.

Eh.

There's no special carpet that
dogs like, is there?

Will Roy say something?

We call it Astroturf. C'mon,

Roy watches Angela and her boyfriend flip through carpet
fragments. Her attention is obviously divided.

Ooh, I really like that one.

That's a nice choice. Durable. You
barely notice stains it's so dark.
ANGELA
How much is it?
ROY
Sticker's seventy-five. But I can
knock off twenty percent if you
pay cash.
Angela and her boyfriend mull it over, under their breaths,
then agree: it's a sale. Angela dips into her purse...
SLACKER

rent, she buys all the carpets.
ANGELA
Shit. I think I left my... yeah,
I left my wallet in the car.

with a big sigh)
Can you get it for me? It
probably just fell under my seat.
He smirks at Roy -- what can he say? -- and heads off.
SLACKER
Be right back.
Roy and Angela watch him go, alone together. She turns
at last to face him. They lock eyes for a moment, then
she indicates the cigarettes in his shirt pocket.

It's not that much different from

Only been on it six months.

They smoke in silence.

Nah. I'm retired. That was a

Roy pulls his Caprice up the driveway and gets out.
Groceries in hand, he heads to the front door, unlocks
it, enters.
Turning to look inside the house: THROUGH the front
windows, for the first time open and unencumbered by
shades: Roy walks into the living room. A new carpet
replaces the old. He pays it no mind. He leafs through
mail, calls out a name, then turns as --- Kathy enters from the kitchen, wiping her hands clean
on a dishrag. She smiles and Roy smiles, too, explaining
what he got at the market and opening his market bag wide
for her to see. She rubs his head: nice job, then
kisses him, and he kisses back --- and when they break, she whispers sweetly in his ear,
and he smiles even more.
He looks down to lay his palm
gently on her belly. They go into dinner.
