CAST OF CHARACTERS
In the order of their appearance
SAMUEL SPADE.............His thickish brows, hook nose,
hight flat temples and widow's
peak give him the look of a
rather pleasant Satan. He is
over six feet tall. The steep
rounded slope of his shoulders
makes his body seem almost conical -- no broader than it is
thick and keeps his clothes
from fitting very well. He is
what most private detectives
would like to be, a hard, shifty
fellow, able to take care of
himself in any situation, able
to get the best of anybody he
comes in contact with whether
criminal, innocent bystander or
client.
EFFIE PERINE.............Spade's secretary. A lanky,
sunburned girl of twenty-two or
three, with a shiny boyish face,
bright, direct, unspoiled.
BRIGUD O'SHAUGHNESSY.....alias Miss Wonderly. Tall,
pliantly slender. Her body is
erect and high-breasted. Her
legs long, her hands and feet
narrow. She has dark, soft,
wavy hair, full lips. Her eyes
are timid, childlike at times
in their apparent innocence.
MILES ARCHER.............Spade's partner. Medium height,
solidly built, wide in the
shoulders, thick in the neck,
with a heavy-jawed red face.
He's about as many years past
forty as Spade is past thirty.
DETECTIVE TOM POLHAUS....A barrel-bellied, tall man with
shrewd, small eyes, a thick
mouth and carelessly shaven
dark jowls.

CAST OF CHARACTERS (Cont.)
LT. OF DETECTIVES DUNDY..Compactly built man with a
round head under short-cut
grizzled hair and a square face
behind short-cut grizzled moustache. His eyes are hard as
pebbles and so deliberate as to
make their focus seem a matter
of mechanics, something only to
avoid.
IVA ARCHER...............Miles' wife. Blonde, a few
years more than thirty. Her
facial prettiness is perhaps
five years past its best moment. Her body is finely
modelled and exquisite in a
full-blown way.
MR. FREED................Hotel Manager. Plump, middleaged, in well fitting clothes.
He has the ingratiating-yetslightly-skeptical manner of
the professional host.
JOEL CAIRO...............Dark, small-boned, of medium
height. His hair is black,
smooth, glossy. He has narrow
shoulders, plump hips. Jewels
twinkle on the fingers of both
hands. He speaks the rather
too-perfect English sometimes
heard out of foreigners. He
is elaborately formal and
polite.
WILMER COOK..............A boy of nineteen or twenty,
under-sized, pale-faced with
small regular features and
light-colored small eyes that
stare bleakly under long,
curling lashes.
LUKE.....................House detective. Round and
sallow of face, compactly
built, tidily dressed in dark
clothes.

CAST OF CHARACTERS (Cont.)
KASPER GUTMAN............Flabbily fat with bulbous pink
cheeks and lips and chins and
neck with a great soft egg of
a belly that is all his torso
and pendant cone for arms and
legs. His eyes, made small by
fat puffs around them, are dark
and sleek. Dark ringlets thinly cover his broad scalp. He
wears a black cutaway coat,
black vest, black satin Ascot
tie holding a pinkish pearl,
striped grey worsted trousers,
and patent-leather shoes. His
manner, or rather the manner he
affects, is benevolently paternal. Good humor, tolerance,
bonhomie echo in his every
utterance.
BRYAN....................District Attorney. He has a
lofty forehead, an orator's
wide mouth and a wide dimpled
chin. His voice in conversation has the latent power and
deep resonance of the orator.
MATE OF THE "LA PALOMA"..A thickly-set figure in dark
uniform. He carries himself
stiffly erect. His watery
blue eyes are candid and his
slow speech carries a slight
Scandanavian accent.
CAPTAIN JACOBY...........Tall, gaunt, with a deeplylined weather-beaten face.
FRANK RICHMAN............Chauffeur. Thick-set, youngish man with a plaid cap and
a tough, cheery face.
Policemen, Deteectives, Cab Drivers,
Asst. Dist. Attorney, Stenographer
(Male), Hotel Clerk, etc. etc.....

FADE IN:

CLOSE SHOT - ON A WINDOW
upon which the words - SPADE AND ARCHER - appear in
reverse, in big black letters. Through the window we see
to the left tall buildings that front San Francisco's
Market Street, to the right, a section of the Bay Bridge.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO:

INT. OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - SAM SPADE
behind his cheap office desk, back to the window. His jaw
is long and bony, his chin a jutting V under the more
flexible V of his mouth. The V motif is picked up again by
thickish brows rising upward from twin creases above a
hooked nose. His dark hair grows down to a point on his
forehead. He looks rather pleasantly like Satan. Spade is
rolling a cigarette. OVER SCENE the SOUND of the office
door opening. He does not look up.
SPADE
Yes, sweetheart?

INT. OFFICE - MED. SHOT
EFFIE PERINE, a lanky, sunburned girl with eyes brown and
playful and a shiny, boyish face, shuts the door behind
her, leans against it.
EFFIE
There's a girl wants to see you.
Her name's Wonderly.
SPADE
A customer?
I guess so.
her anyway.

EFFIE
You'll want to see
She's a knockout.

SPADE
(licking his cigarette)
Shoo her in, Effie darling -- shoo
her in.
(he puts the
cigarette in
his mouth, sets
fire to it)
The door opens again.
on the knob.

Effie Perine stands with her hand

EFFIE
Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?
OVER SCENE a voice murmurs something, then MISS WONDERLY
appears, advances slowly with tentative steps, looks at
Spade with eyes that are both shy and probing. Spade
rises, bows, indicates with a thick-fingered hand, the
oaken armchair beside his desk.
MISS WONDERLY
(softly)
Thank you.
She sits down on the edge of the chair's wooden seat.
Spade sinks back into his swivel chair, makes a quarter
turn to face her. OVER SCENE the tappety-tap-tap of Effie
Perine's typewriter. Spade smiles politely. White teeth
glisten in the crescent Miss Wonderly's answering smile
makes. She remains erect in the chair as if she expected
to stay seated for only a moment. Her hands in dark gloves
clasp and unclasp the flat, dark handbag in her lap.
SPADE
(rocking back in
chair)
Now what can I do for you, Miss
Wonderly?
She catches her breath, looks at him, swallows.
MISS WONDERLY
(hurriedly)
Could you? -- I thought -- I -that is...
She tortures her lower lip. Only her dark eyes speak now,
pleading. Spade smiles and nods.
SPADE
(after several moments)
Suppose you tell me about it from
the very beginning.
MISS WONDERLY
That was in New York.
SPADE
Yes?
And now the words tumble out.

MISS WONDERLY
I don't know where she met him in
New York. She's much younger than I
-- only seventeen -- we didn't have
the same friends. Father and mother
are in Europe. It would kill them.
I've got to get her back before they
come home.
He nods as though the rush of words made perfect sense
to him.
SPADE
Yes...
MISS WONDERLY
They're coming home the first of
the month.
SPADE
(reassuringly)
That gives us two weeks.
MISS WONDERLY
I didn't know what she had done
until her letter came. I was
frantic.
(her lips tremble)
I didn't know what to do.
(pathetically)
What could I do?
SPADE
(in the gentle tones
one uses to a child
on the the verge of
tears)
Nothing, of course... But then, her
letter came?
MISS WONDERLY
Yes.
(again the words
tumble forth)
And I sent her a telegram asking her
to come back home. I sent it to
General Delivery here. That was the
only address she gave me... I
waited a whole week but no answer
came -- and mother's and father's
return was growing nearer and
nearer, so I came out here to get
her. I wrote her I was coming. I
shouldn't have done that, should I?

SPADE
It's not always easy to know what to
do... You haven't found her?
MISS WONDERLY
No, I haven't. I wrote her that I
would go to the St. Mark and I
begged her to meet me there and let
me talk to her. I waited three
days. She didn't come... didn't
even send a message.
Spade nods, frowns sympathetically.
MISS WONDERLY
It was horrible! Waiting...!
...Not knowing what had happened to
her -- what might be happening to
her.
(she stops trying to
smile -- shudders)
I wrote her another letter General
Delivery. Yesterday afternoon I
went to the post office. I stayed
there until after dark but I didn't
see her. I went there again this
morning and still didn't see Corinne
-- but I saw Floyd Thursby.
Spade's frown goes away.
attentiveness.

In its place comes a look of sharp

MISS WONDERLY
He wouldn't tell me where Corinne
was.
(hopelessly)
He wouldn't tell me anything except
that she was well and happy. But
he'd say that anyway, wouldn't he?
SPADE
It might be true.
MISS WONDERLY
(tremblingly)
I hope it is... I do hope it is.
But... but... he said she didn't
want to see me. I can't believe
that. He promised to tell her he
had seen me, and to bring her to see
me, if she would come, this evening
at the hotel. He said he knew she
wouldn't. He promised to come
himself if she didn't...

The office door opens. She breaks off with a startled hand
to her mouth. The man who opened the door comes in a step.
ARCHER
Oh, excuse me -(hastily, he takes
off his brown hat,
starts to back out)
SPADE
It's all right, Miles. Come in.
Miss Wonderly, this is Mr. Archer,
my partner.
Archer ducks his head, smiling at Miss Wonderly, shuts the
door behind him and makes a vague gesture with the hat in
his hand. He is of medium height, solidly built, wide in
the shoulders, thick in the neck with a heavy-jawed, red
face. He is about as many years past forty as Spade is
past thirty.
SPADE
Miss Wonderly's sister ran away from
New York with a fellow named Floyd
Thursby. They are here in San
Francisco. Miss Wonderly has seen
Thursby and has a date with him
tonight. Maybe he'll bring the
sister with him. The chances are he
won't. Miss Wonderly wants us to
find the sister and get her away
from him and back home.
(he looks at Miss
Wonderly)
Right?
MISS WONDERLY
(indistinctly)
Yes.
Archer comes forward to the corner of the desk. While the
girl looks at her bag, he looks at her. His little brown
eyes run their bold appraising gaze from her lowered face
to her feet and up to her face again. Then he looks at
Spade and makes a silent whistling mouth of appreciation.
Spade winks at him.
SPADE
It's simply a matter of having a man
at the hotel this evening to shadow
him when he leads us to your sister.
If she doesn't want to leave him
after we've found her -- well, there
are ways of managing that.

ARCHER
(his voice heavy,
coarse)
Yeah...
Miss Wonderly looks up quickly.

Fear shows on her face.

MISS WONDERLY
Oh, but you must be careful.
(her voice shakes
a little and her
lips shape the
words with nervous
jerkiness)
I'm deathly afraid of him -- of what
he might do. She's so young and his
bringing her here from New York is
such a serious -- mightn't he -mightn't he do something to her?
Spade smiles, pats the arms of his chair.
SPADE
Just leave that to us.
how to handle him.

We'll know

MISS WONDERLY
(earnestly)
But I want you to know that he's
a dangerous man. I honestly don't
think he'd stop at anything.
don't believe he'd hesitate to -to kill Corinne if he thought it
would save him.
ARCHER
Can he cover up by marrying her?
MISS WONDERLY
(blushes in confusion)
He has a wife and three children
in England.
SPADE
They usually do though not always
in England.
(reaching for
pencil and pad)
What does he look like?
Spade makes notes as she talks.

MISS WONDERLY
He has dark hair and thick eyebrows.
He talks in a loud blustery way. He
gives the impression of being -- a
violent person.
SPADE
Thin, medium or heavy-built?
MISS WONDERLY
Quite athletic. He's broadshouldered and has what could be
called a military carriage. He was
wearing a light gray suit and a gray
hat when I saw him this morning.
SPADE
(laying down the
pencil)
What does he do for a living?
MISS WONDERLY
I haven't the slightest idea.
SPADE
At what time is he coming to see
you?
MISS WONDERLY
After eight o'clock.
SPADE
All right, Miss Wonderly.

We'll

ARCHER
(interjects)
I'll look after it myself.
Spade gives him a glance of concealed amusement.
MISS WONDERLY
(pathetically grateful)
Thank you... Thank you.
She opens her handbag with nervous fingers, brings out two
bills, puts them on Spade's desk.
MISS WONDERLY
Will that be enough?
Spade nods. She gives Spade her hand.
graceful tone:

Then, in the same

MISS WONDERLY
Thank you... Thank you.
SPADE
Not at all... It'll help some if
you meet Thursby in the lobby.
MISS WONDERLY
I will.
ARCHER
You don't have to look for me.
I'll see you all right.
She nods.

Spade goes to the door with Miss Wonderly.
MISS WONDERLY
(repeats once again)
Thank you...

When she is gone, Spade comes back to his desk.
picked up one of the bills, is examining it.

Archer has

ARCHER
(growls complacently)
They're right enough.
(he folds it
and tucks it
in his vest
pocket)
And they have brothers in her bag.
Spade pockets the other bill before sitting down.
SPADE
What do you think of her?
ARCHER
Sweet.
(guffaws suddenly)
Maybe you saw her first, Sam, but
I spoke first.
He puts his hands in his trousers pockets and teeters on
his heels. Spade, behind his desk, grins wolfishly at
Archer, showing the edges of his teeth far back in his
jaws.
SPADE
You've got brains.

Yes, you have.

He begins to make a cigarette.
DISSOLVE TO:

DARKNESS
A telephone is RINGING. It rings three times. Then the
SOUND of bed-springs creaking and of the instrument being
lifted.
SPADE'S VOICE
Hello... Yes, speaking... Dead?...
Yes... Fifteen minutes... Where?...
Bush and Stockton... Thanks...
The SOUND of the instrument being replaced, followed by the
click of a switch.

INT. SPADE'S ROOM
Spade, barefoot in checked pajamas, sits on the side of his
bed scowling at the telephone. The hands of a tinny alarm
clock, which sits on a volume of "Duke's Celebrated
Criminal Cases of America", are at five minutes past two.
Spade scratches the back of his neck, reaches for a packet
of brown papers and a sack of tobacco by the telephone,
makes a cigarette with deliberate care, licks it, puts it
in his mouth. The curtains at the two open windows
flutter. From across the bay comes the dull moaning of the
Alcatraz fog horn. Spade sits for several moments with the
cold cigarette in his mouth. Then he reaches for the
telephone again, dials a number. Waiting for the answer,
he shivers.
SPADE
(into the telephone)
Send a cab to...
DISSOLVE TO:

MED. SHOT - FRONT OF SECOND CLASS APARTMENT BLDG. - NIGHT
The overhead arc throws light on faces at the windows.
CAMERA PULLS BACK past a uniformed policeman, who is
chewing gum, to include the sign on the lamp post: BUSH
STREET. Cars are parked helter-skelter on either side of
the street. A taxi comes into scene, stops in the middle
of the street. Spade gets out, gives the driver money. As
he starts across the street toward CAMERA, the policeman
puts out an arm.
POLICEMAN
What do you want here?
SPADE
I'm Sam Spade. Tom Polhaus phoned
me.

POLICEMAN
(recognizing him -his arm goes down)
I didn't know you at first.
back there.
(he jerks a thumb
over his shoulder)

They're

CAMERA PANS with him toward the alley-way in which a dark
ambulance stands.

MED. SHOT - THE ALLEY-WAY
as Spade enters. It is bordered on one side by a waisthigh fence. Spade crosses to a place where a ten-foot
length of the top rail of the fence has been torn from a
post at one end and hangs dangling from the other. He
looks down.

LONG SHOT - THE HILLSIDE
SHOOTING over Spade's shoulder. From the foot of the fence
the hillside drops steeply away. Fifteen feet down the
slope a flat boulder sticks up. Two men stand in the angle
between the boulder and slope. One is pointing a camera.
A bulb flashes and we get a momentary glimpse of a body
lying on the boulder. Other men with lights move up and
down the slope. One of them raises a torch so the beam
strikes Spade in the face.
POLHAUS
(calls)
Hello, Sam.
Lowering the beam, Tom Polhaus clambers up to the alley,
his shadow running before him. Stepping over the fence, he
joins Spade by the broken rail. He is a barrel-bellied,
tall man with shrewd, small eyes. His shoes, his hands and
his knees are covered with mud.
POLHAUS
I figured you'd want to see it
before we took him away.
SPADE
What happened?

Thanks, Tom.

Polhaus points at his own left breast with a muddy finger.
POLHAUS
Got him right through the pump
with this.

He takes a flat revolver from his coat pocket, holds it
toward Spade but Spade doesn't take it. After a moment
Polhaus flashes his light on it. Mud inlays the
depressions in the revolver's surface.
A Webley.

POLHAUS
English, ain't it?

Spade takes his elbow from the fence post, leans down to
look at the weapon but does not touch it.
SPADE
Yes. Webley-Fosbery Automatic
Revolver, thirty-eight, eight shot.
They don't make them anymore. How
many gone out of it?
POLHAUS
One pill.
(he pokes his left
breast again)
SPADE
(speaking quickly)
He was shot up here, huh?... standing
like you are with his back to the
fence. The man that shot him stands
here.
(he goes in front
of Polhaus and
raises his hand
chest high with
a leveled forefinger)
Miles goes back, taking the top off
the fence and going on through and
down till the rock catches him.
That it?
POLHAUS
That's it.
(he works his
brows together)
The blast burnt his coat.
SPADE
Who found him?
POLHAUS
Man on the boat.
SPADE
Anybody hear the shot?

POLHAUS
Somebody must've. We only just got
here, Sam.
(turning he puts
a leg back over
the fence)
Coming down for a look at him before
he's moved?
SPADE
(shortly)
No.
Polhaus, astride the fence, looks at Spade with surprised,
small eyes.
SPADE
You've seen everything I could.
Polhaus nods doubtfully, withdraws leg from the fence.
POLHAUS
His gun was tucked away on his hip.
It hadn't been fired. His overcoat
was buttoned. There was a hundred
dollar bill in his vest pocket and
thirty some bucks in his pants...
Was he working Sam?
After a moment's hesitation, Sam nods.
POLHAUS
Well?
SPADE
He was supposed to be tailing
fellow named Floyd Thursby.

POLHAUS
What for?
Spade puts his hands into his overcoat pocket, blinks
sleepy eyes at Polhaus.
POLHAUS
(impatiently)
What for?
SPADE
We were trying to find out where
he lived.
He gins slightly, takes his hand from his pocket, pats
Polhaus' shoulder.

SPADE
Don't crowd me.
(his hands go
back into his
pockets)
I'm going out to break the news to
Miles' wife.
(He turns away)
Polhaus, scowling, opens his mouth, closes it, without
having said anything, clears his throat, puts the scowl off
his face and speaks with a husky sort of gentleness.
POLHAUS
It's tough -- him getting it like
that. Miles had his faults same as
the rest of us but I guess he must
of had some good points too.
SPADE
I guess so.
He goes toward the mouth of the alley. The brick wall to
his left reflects the light of another flash bulb.

MED. SHOT - BUSH STREET
Spade comes out of the alley, turns down Bush Street.
uniformed policeman is on the sidewalk now.

The

POLICEMAN
(as Spade passes)
Bad business.
SPADE
Bad enough.
Another car pulls up. Two men get out, one in uniform, and
cross toward the alley. The first policeman salutes the
one who is not in uniform. Spade goes on down the street.
WIPE TO:

INT. DRUG STORE - CLOSE SHOT - SPADE
in telephone booth, receiver to his ear. The receiver
repeats the ringing sound four times. Then:
SPADE
(into phone)
Effie -- it's me... Listen, Precious
...Miles has been shot... Yes...
He's dead... Now don't get excited...
(MORE)

SPADE (CONT'D)
Yes... You'll have to break it to
Iva -- I'll try first -- keep her
away from me... That's a good girl
-- get right over there... You're
an angel... Bye.
He hangs up, opens the door, leaves the booth. CAMERA PANS
as he goes out of drug store and up the street.
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SPADE'S ROOM
The tinny alarm clock on the volume of "Celebrated Criminal
Cases" says 3:40 when Spade turns on the light. He drops
his hat and overcoat on the bed and exits into the kitchen,
returns after a moment with a tall bottle of Bacardi. He
pours a drink, drinks it standing, pours another.
OVER SCENE the SOUND of the street-door buzzer. Spade's
face becomes ugly. He makes no move until the buzzer
SOUNDS again. Then, sighing, he goes to the telephone box
beside his bedroom door, presses a button that releases the
street-door lock, stands scowling at the black telephone
box. OVER SCENE the grating and rattling of the elevator
door in the corridor opening and closing. Spade sighs
again, moves into the corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR - CLOSE SHOT
as Spade opens the door on the barrel-bellied detective
Polhaus, and Lieutenant Dundy. Spade's face brightens.
His eyes lose their harassed expression.
SPADE
(to Polhaus)
Hello, Tom.
(to Dundy)
Hello, lieutenant.

Come in.

They nod together, neither saying anything, and enter.
Spade shuts the door as they go toward his bedroom.

INT. SPADE'S BEDROOM - MED. SHOT - SPADE, POLHAUS, DUNDY
as Polhaus sits on and end of the sofa and Spade on the
side of the bed. The Lieutenant takes a chair beside the
table. Lieutenant Dundy is a compactly-built man with a
round head and short-cut grizzled hair and a square face
behind a short-cut grizzled moustache.

A five-dollar gold piece is pinned to his necktie and there
is a small elaborate diamond-set secret society emblem on
his lapel. He examines the room with hard, deliberate
eyes. Then he looks at Polhaus, who shifts uncomfortably
on the sofa.
POLHAUS
Did you break the news to Miles'
wife, Sam?
SPADE
Uh-huh.
POLHAUS
How'd she take it?
SPADE
(shaking his head)
I don't know anything about women.
POLHAUS
(softly)
Since when, don't you?
The Lieutenant puts his hand on his knees, leans forward,
fixes eyes on Spade in a peculiarly rigid stare as if their
focus were a matter of mechanics -- to be changed by
pulling a lever.
DUNDY
What kind of gun do you carry?
SPADE
(easily)
None. I don't like them much.
Of course, there are some at the
office.
DUNDY
You don't happen to have one
here?
Spade shakes his head.
DUNDY
You sure of that?
SPADE
Look around.
(smiling, he waves
his empty glass)
Turn the dump upside-down if you
want. I won't squawk -- if you've
got a search warrant.

Polhaus shifts his seat on the sofa again, blows a deep
breath out through his nose.
POLHAUS
(plaintively)
We're not wanting to make any
trouble, Sam.
SPADE
(ignoring Polhaus -to Dundy)
I don't like this. What are you
sucking around for? Tell me or
get out!
(he rises)
POLHAUS
(pleading)
You can't treat us that way, Sam.
It ain't right. We got our work
to do.
Dundy jumps up, stands close to Spade, thrusts his square
face up to the taller man's.
DUNDY
Why were you tailing Thursby?
SPADE
I wasn't. Miles was. For the
swell reason that we had a client
who was paying good United States
money to have him tailed.
DUNDY
Who's the client?
SPADE
Sorry, can't tell you that.
POLHAUS
(begging)
Be reasonable, Sam. Give us a
chance. How can we turn up
anything on Miles' killing if you
won't tell us what you've got?
DUNDY
Tom says you were in too much
of a hurry to even stop for a
look at your dead partner.
Polhaus growls something, hangs his head.

DUNDY
And you didn't go to Archer's
house to tell his wife. We
called up and the girl in your
office was there and she said
you told her to go.
Spade's face is stupid in its calmness.
DUNDY
I give you ten minutes to get
to a phone and do your talking
to the girl. I give you ten
minutes to get to Thursby's
joint -- Geary near Leavenworth -you could do it easily in that
time.
SPADE
(to Polhaus)
What's your boy friend getting
at, Tom?
DUNDY
Just this.
(he taps Spade's
chest with the
knuckles of two
bent fingers)
Thursby was shot down in front
of his hotel about half an hour
after you left Bush Street.
SPADE
(separating his words)
Keep -- your -- paws -- off -- me!
DUNDY
(his eyes are pale
disks)
What time did you get home?
Spade searches for his tobacco and papers, starts making a
cigarette.
SPADE
(candidly)
I came in just a few minutes ahead
of you. I was walking around
thinking things over.

DUNDY
We knew you weren't here. We tried
to get you on the phone. Where'd
you walk to?
SPADE
(licks his cigarette)
Out Bush Street a way.
DUNDY
See anybody that...
SPADE
No -- no witnesses.
(he laughs pleasantly)
Sit down, Dundy. You haven't
finished your drink.
(to Polhaus)
Another one, Tom?
POLHAUS
No thanks, Sam.
Dundy sits down but pays no attention to the glass. Spade
fills his won glass, drinks. Then himself sits down again
on the side of the bed.
SPADE
I know where I stand now.
(he looks with
friendly eyes
from one man
to the other)
Sorry I got up on my hind legs, but
you birds trying to rope me made me
nervous. Miles getting knocked off
bothered me and then you birds
cracking foxy. That's all right now
though -- now that I know what
you're up to.
POLHAUS
Forget it.
SPADE
Thursby die?
POLHAUS
Yes.
SPADE
How did I kill him?

I forget.

POLHAUS
(grunts disgustedly -then:)
He was shot four times in the back
with a .44 or .45 from across the
street. Nobody saw it but that's
the way if figures.
SPADE
Hotel people know anything about
him?
POLHAUS
Nothing except he'd been there a
week.
SPADE
Alone?
POLHAUS
(nods)
Alone.
SPADE
(makes a careless
gesture with his
cigarette)
Did you find out who he was?...
What his game was?... Did you?
DUNDY
We thought you could tell us that.
Spade regards the Lieutenant with eyes that hold an
exaggerated amount of candor.
SPADE
I've never seen Thursby -- dead or
alive.
Dundy gets up again.

His lower lip pushes the words out.

DUNDY
You know me, Spade. If you did it
or you didn't, you'll get a square
deal out of me, and most of the
breaks. I don't know that I'd blame
you a lot -- the man that killed
your partner.
(his eyes become
hard as pebbles)
But that wouldn't keep me from
nailing you.

SPADE
(evenly)
Fair enough... but I'd feel better
about it if you'd have a drink
with me.
Spade pours Bacardi into the three glasses, gives one to
each of the detectives, then raises his own.
SPADE
Success to crime!
Dundy barely touches his lips to the glass, puts it down
and starts out. Polhaus drinks his off, puts his hand out
awkwardly. Spade shakes the hand. Then Polhaus follows
his superior into the vestibule and the hall. As Spade
starts to undress -FADE OUT.
FADE IN:

CLOSE SHOT - A GLASS PANELED DOOR
On it in black gold-edged letters:
SPADE AND ARCHER
Spade enters scene, opens the door, goes into the outer
office.

INT. OUTER OFFICE
as Spade enters. Effie Perine is at her desk opening the
morning mail. She puts down a handful of envelopes and a
brass paper knife, frowns at Spade.
EFFIE
(voice low and warning)
She's in there.
Spade makes the face of one who has an ugly taste in his
mouth.
SPADE
(his voice low)
I told you to keep her away!
EFFIE
(irritably)
Yes -- but you didn't tell me how.
(her shoulders
droop wearily)
(MORE)

EFFIE (CONT'D)
Don't be cranky, Sam. I had her all
night.
Spade puts his hand on the girl's head, smoothes her hair.
SPADE
Sorry, angel. I didn't mean -(he breaks off as
the door to the
inner office opens)
-- Hello, Iva.
IVA
Oh, Sam.
She is a blonde woman of a few more years than thirty. Her
facial prettiness is perhaps five years past its best
moment. Her body in black clothes from hat to shoes, is
finely modeled and exquisite. She steps back from the door
and stands waiting for Spade. He takes his hand from Effie
Perine's head, enters the inner office.

INT. INNER OFFICE - SPADE AND IVA
as she shuts the door. Iva comes to him quickly, putting
out her arms and raising her face for his kiss. After the
kiss, he makes a little movement as if to release her but
she presses her face to his chest and begins sobbing.
Spade strokes her shoulder saying:
SPADE
Poor darling!
His voice is tender but his eyes, on the desk across the
room from his own -- the desk that had been his partner's
-- are angry. He turns his chin aside to avoid contact
with the crown of her hat.
SPADE
Did Effie attend to everything?
IVA
Yes, I think so... Oh, Sam...
Spade's teeth show in an impatient grimace. He bends his
head for a surreptitious look at the watch on his wrist.
The woman stirs in his arms, raises her face. Her eyes are
wet, round, white-ringed. Her mouth is moist.
IVA
Oh, Sam...
(she moans)
Did you kill him?

Spade takes his arms from around her, steps back, stares at
her with bulging eyes, his bony jaw hanging loose. She
keeps her arms ups as he left them. Anguish clouds her
eyes. Her soft, damp red lips tremble.
Spade laughs -- a harsh syllable, goes to the window,
stands there looking out until she starts towards him.
Then he turns quickly, goes to his desk, sits down and
looks at her with eyes that glitter between narrow lids.
SPADE
(coldly)
Who put that idea in your head?
IVA
I thought...
She lifts a hand to her mouth and fresh tears come to her
eyes. She moves with easy, sure-footed grace to a place
beside the desk.
IVA
(humbly)
Be kind to me, Sam.
He laughs again, his eyes still glittering.
SPADE
You killed my husband, Sam.
kind to me!
(he claps his
hands together)

Be

Iva begins to cry audibly. Spade's jaw muscles bulge, then
he takes a deep breath, makes his face expressionless, gets
up, goes around the desk to stand behind her, put his arms
around her.
SPADE
(softly)
Now... don't... Iva... don't...
(he puts his
mouth to her ear
and whispers)
You shouldn't have come here today,
darling. You ought to be home.
Iva turns around in his arms to face him.
IVA
You'll come soon?

SPADE
As soon as I can.
(he leads her
to the door,
opens it)
Goodbye, Iva.
He bows her out, shuts the door, returns to his desk. He
takes tobacco and cigarette papers from this vest pocket
but does not roll a cigarette. He sits holding the papers
in one hand, tobacco in the other, and looks with brooding
eyes at his dead partner's desk. Presently Effie Perine
opens the door, comes in.
EFFIE
(quietly)
Well?
Spade says nothing. His brooding gaze does not move from
his dead partner's desk.
EFFIE
(in a louder voice)
How did you and the widow make out?
SPADE
(only his lips move)
She thinks I shot Miles.
EFFIE
So you could marry her?
Spade makes no reply to that. The girl leans over, takes
the papers and the tobacco sack.
SPADE
The police think I shot Thursby...
the guy Miles was tailing for the
Wonderly girl -- Who do you think I
shot?
Effie's thin fingers shape the cigarette. She licks it,
smoothes it, bites the end and places it between Spade's
fingers.
SPADE
Thanks, honey.
He puts an arm around her slim waist, rests his cheek
wearily against her hip.

EFFIE
Are you going to marry Iva?
(she snaps his
desk lighter)
SPADE
Don't be silly.
(he puts the
end of his
cigarette to
the flame)
I wish I had never laid eyes on her.
EFFIE
Maybe you do now.
(a trace of
spitefulness
comes into her
voice -- leans
over for a view
of his face)
Do you suppose she could have killed
him?
Spade sits up straight, takes his arm from her waist,
smiles at her.
SPADE
(tenderly -- through
the smoke)
You're an angel... a nice rattlebrained angel!
EFFIE
(wryly)
Oh, am I? Suppose I told you that
your Iva hadn't been home many
minutes when I arrived to break the
news at three o'clock this morning?
Spade's eyes are immediately alert.
SPADE
Are you telling me?
EFFIE
(nods)
She kept me waiting at the door
while she undressed. Her clothes
were on a chair where she had dumped
them -- hat and coat underneath.
Her singlet on top was still warm.
She had wrinkled up the bed but the
wrinkles weren't mashed down.

SPADE
(pats Effie's hand)
You're a detective, darling, but...
(shaking his head)
She didn't kill him.
EFFIE
Do the police really think you shot
this what's-his-name?
He brushes the ashes off his cigarette.
EFFIE
(insisting)
Do they?
Spade shrugs.
EFFIE
Look at me, Sam.
He obeys with elaborate seriousness.
EFFIE
You worry me. You always think you
know what you're doing but you're
too slick for your own good, and
some day you're going to find it out.
Spade grins mockingly at her.
takes up the receiver.

The telephone RINGS.

Effie

EFFIE
(into the phone)
Spade and Archer... Oh, yes, Miss
Wonderly...
Spade takes the phone from her hand.
SPADE
(into phone)
Hello... Yes, this is Sam Spade...
I was just going to call you...
Oh...
(after a short pause)
How's that?... Oh... Where are
you?... The Coronet on California
Street, Apartment 1001...
As Spade repeats the address, Effie Writes it down on a
slip of paper.

SPADE
What's the name?... Miss Leblanc...
OK, I'll be right over.
Spade sets down the phone and puts on his hat.
SPADE
Have Miles' desk moved out and have
the "Spade and Archer" taken off the
door and windows and "Samuel Spade"
put on.
He turns to the door, hesitates, then goes back to the
desk, picks up the slip of paper on which the address is
written, takes out his lighter, snaps on the flame, and
sets fire to the slip of paper. He holds it until all but
one corner is curling black ash, then drops it on the
linoleum and mashes it out with his foot.

pressing the buzzer of Apartment 1001. Miss Wonderly, in a
belted green crepe dress, opens the door immediately. Her
face is flushed. Her hair parted on the left side sweeping
back in loose waves over her right temple, is somewhat
tousled.
SPADE
(taking off his hat)
Good morning.

-- then in a hushed
timid voice)
Come in, Mr. Spade.

She lays his hat on a table, sits down on a walnut settee.
Spade sits on a brocaded oval-backed chair, facing her.
She looks at her fingers, working them together. Then:

MISS WONDERLY
Mr. Spade, I've a terrible, terrible
confession to make.
He makes a polite smile.
MISS WONDERLY
That -- that story I told you
yesterday was all -- a story.
(she stammers,
looks at him
with miserable
frightened eyes)
SPADE
Oh, that...
(lightly)
We didn't exactly believe your story,
Miss -- Miss -- is your name Wonderly
or Leblanc?
MISS WONDERLY
(working her fingers again)
It's really O'Shaughnessy -- Brigid
O'Shaughnessy.
SPADE
We didn't exactly believe your story,
Miss O'Shaughnessy. We believed your
two hundred dollars.
BRIGID
You mean...
SPADE
I mean, that you paid us more than
if you had been telling us the
truth...
(blandly)
...and enough more to make it all
right.
BRIGID
(bites her lip)
Mr. Spade, tell me...
(her face becomes
haggard, eyes
desperate)
Am I to blame -- for last night?

SPADE
You warned us that Thursby was
dangerous. Of course, you lied
to us about your sister and all -but that doesn't count. We didn't
believe you.
(he shrugs his sloping
shoulders)
I wouldn't say it was your fault.
BRIGID
(very softly)
Thank you.
(she puts her hand
to her breast)
Mr. Archer was so -- so alive
yesterday, so solid and hearty
and...
SPADE
(sharply)
Stop it. He knew what he was
doing. Those are the chances
we take.
BRIGID
Was -- was he married?
SPADE
Yes, with ten thousand insurance,
no children, and a wife who didn't
like him.
BRIGID
Oh, please don't!
SPADE
(shrugging again)
That's the way it was.
He glances at his watch, gets up.
SPADE
Anyway, there's no time for worrying
about that now.
(nods his head toward
the window)
Out there a flock of policemen and
assistant district attorneys are
running around with their noses to
the ground.
Brigid moves over on the sofa, making a place for him
beside her -- but Spade remains standing.

BRIGID
(her voice thin
and tremulous)
Mr. Spade, do they know about me?
SPADE
Not yet. I've been stalling them
until I could see you.
BRIGID
Must they know about me at all,
Mr. Spade? Couldn't you somehow
manage to shield me from them?
So I won't have to answer their
questions?
SPADE
Maybe. But I'll have to know what
it's all about.
She rises, puts a timid hand to his coat sleeve.
BRIGID
I can't tell you -- I can't tell
you now -- later I will -- when I
can. You must trust me Mr. Spade.
Oh, I'm so alone and afraid!
I've got nobody to help me if
you won't help me.
(begging)
Be generous, Mr. Spade. You're
strong. You're brave. You can
spare me some of that strength
and courage, surely.
(she drops to her
knees, her hand
touching his, clings
pitifully)
Help me, Mr. Spade! I need help
so badly. I've no right to ask
you but I do ask you. Help me!
Spade empties his lungs with a long sighing exhalation.
SPADE
You won't need much of anybody's
help. You're good. It's chiefly
your eyes, I think, and that throb
you get in your voice when you
say things like "Be generous,
Mr. Spade."

She jumps to her feet. Her face blanching painfully, but
she holds her head erect and she looks Spade straight in
the eye.
BRIGID
(voice chilled)
I deserve that. But -- Oh -- the
lie was in the way I said it and
not at all in what I said.
(lips trembling
slightly, but
head still erect)
It's my own fault that you can't
believe me now.
Spade's face darkens.

He looks down at the floor.

SPADE
(muttering)
Now you are dangerous.
Brigid O'Shaughnessy goes to the table, picks up his hat.
She comes back and stands in front of him, holding the hat
for him to take if he wishes. Her face is thin, haggard.
SPADE
(looking at his hat)
I've got nothing against trusting
you blindly except that I won't
be able to do you much good if I
haven't some idea of what it's all
about. For instance, I've got to
have some sort of line on your
Floyd Thursby.
She puts his hat on the table, slips down onto the settee
again.
BRIGID
I met him in the Orient.
(tracing with
pointed fingers
a figure eight
on a sofa pillow)
We came here from Hong Kong last
week. He had promised to help me.
He took advantage of my dependence
on him to betray me.
SPADE
Betray you how?
Brigid O'Shaughnessy shakes her head and says nothing.

SPADE
(taking a new tack)
Why did you want him shadowed?
BRIGID
I wanted to learn how far he had
gone, whom he was meeting. Things
like that.
SPADE
Did he kill Archer?
BRIGID
(surprised)
Yes, certainly.
SPADE
He had a Luger in his shoulder
holster. Archer wasn't killed
with a Luger.
BRIGID
Floyd always carried an extra
revolver in his overcoat pocket.
SPADE
Why all the guns?
BRIGID
He lived by them. The story in
Hong Kong is that he first came to
the Orient as bodyguard to a gambler
who had to leave the States -- that
the gambler had since disappeared
and that Floyd knew about his
disappearance. I don' know. I do
know that he always went heavily
armed and that he never went to
sleep without covering the floor
around his bed with crumpled
newspapers so nobody could come
silently into his room.
SPADE
You picked a nice sort of playmate.
BRIGID
(simply)
Only that sort could have helped me
-- if he had been loyal.

SPADE
(pinching his lower
lip between finger
and thumb)
How bad a hole are you actually in?
BRIGID
(the chill coming
back into her voice)
As bad as could be.
SPADE
Physical danger?
BRIGID
I'm not heroic. I don't think there
is anything worse than death!
SPADE
Then it's that?
BRIGID
It's that as surely as we're sitting
here...
(she shivers)
...unless you help me.
Spade releases his lower lip, runs his fingers through his
hair.
SPADE
Who killed Thursby?

Your enemies or

Brigid puts a crumpled handkerchief to her mouth, speaks
through it.
BRIGID
I don't know. His, I suppose.
But I'm afraid... I don't know.
Spade makes a growling animal noise in his throat.
SPADE
This is hopeless. I don't know
what you want done. I don't even
know if you know what you want.
(he reaches for his hat)
BRIGID
(begging in a
somewhat choked
voice)
You won't go to the police?

SPADE
(his voice loud with rage)
Go to them?
(puts his hat on
his head, pulling
it down tightly)
All I've got to do is stand still
and they'll be swarming all over
me. Well, I'll tell them all I
know and you'll have to take your
chances.
The girl rises from the settee and stands very straight in
front of him, holding her white, panic-stricken face high,
though she cannot hold the twitching muscles of mouth and
chin still.
BRIGID
You've been patient. You've tried
to help me. It's hopeless and
useless, I suppose.
(she stretches
out her right
hand)
I thank you for what you have done.
I -- I'll have to take my chances.
Spade makes the growling, animal noise in his throat again.
Then:
SPADE
(abruptly)
How much money have you got?
The question startles her.
BRIGID
(reluctantly)
I've about five hundred dollars left.
SPADE
Give it to me.
She hesitates, looking timidly at him. He makes an angry
gesture. She goes into her bedroom, returning almost
immediately with a sheaf of paper in one hand. He takes
the money from her, counts it. Then:
SPADE
(scowling)
There's only four hundred here.

BRIGID
(meekly)
I had to keep some to live on.
(she raises a hand
to her breast)
SPADE
(brutally)
Can't you get any more?
BRIGID
No.
SPADE
You must have something you can
raise money on.
BRIGID
I've some rings -- a little jewelry.
SPADE
You'll have to hock them.
(he holds out his hand)
Brigid looks pleadingly at him. His eyes are hard and
implacable. Slowly she puts her hand into the neck of her
dress, brings out a slender roll of bills, gives them to
him. He smoothes the bills out, counts them, gives her
back two of the five bills, puts the others in his pocket.
SPADE
I'll be back as soon as I can
with the best news I can manage.
I'll ring four times -- longshort-long-short -- so you'll
know it's me. You needn't come
to the door with me. I can let
myself out.
He leaves her standing in the center of the floor looking
after him with dazed blue eyes.

INT. SPADE'S OUTER OFFICE - MED. SHOT - EFFIE PERINE

looking at the corridor door. Through the frosted glass
panel we see the shadowy form of a man who is at work
there. The word "Samuel" and "Sp" and most of the "a" show
through in reverse. As Effie watches, the "a" is completed
and the "d" begun. It is interrupted to allow for the
opening of the door and the passing of Spade into the room.

INT. SPADE'S INNER OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - SPADE
seated behind his desk with the phone clamped between his
shoulder and ear so that his hands are free to make a
cigarette.
SPADE

I think I'm going to have to tell
a coroner to go to blazes, Sid.
Can I hide behind the sanctity of
my client's secrets and identities

(listening, he licks
the cigarette, then:)
I know... but Dundy's getting
rambunctious -- and maybe it is a
little bit thick this time...
(lights cigarette)
Hoe much will it cost to be on the
safe side?... I guess it's worth it.
Go ahead... Bye.
He leans back in his chair, surveys the office through
smoke. Miles Archer's desk is gone and the windows say
simply "Samuel Spade" now. Effie comes in, closing the
door behind her, comes over to his desk, puts a card down
before him.

INSERT:

ENGRAVED CARD
Mr. Joel Cairo

BACK TO SCENE
Spade picks up the card, lifts it to his nose, looks at
Effie with arched brows.
EFFIE
(nods)
Gardenia!
Quick!

SPADE
In with him, darling!

She goes to the door, opens it.
EFFIE
Will you come in, Mr. Cairo?
Cairo comes in and she goes out. Mr. Joel Cairo is a
small-boned, dark man of medium height. His hair is black
and smooth and very glossy. A square-cut ruby surrounded
by baguette diamonds gleams against his dark cravat. His
black coat cut tight to narrow shoulders, flares a little
over plump hips. His trousers fit his legs more snugly
than the current fashion. The uppers of his patent leather
shoes are hidden by fawn spats. He holds a black derby hat
in a chamois-gloved hand, and he comes toward Spade with
short, mincing, bobbing steps. Spade inclines his head at
his visitor and then at a chair.
SPADE
Sit down, Mr. Cairo.
Cairo bows elaborately over his hat.
CAIRO
I thank you.
He sits down, primly placing his hat on his knees and
begins to draw off his chamois gloves.
SPADE
(precisely as he
addressed the same
question to Brigid
O'Shaughnessy when
she first appeared)
Now, what can I do for you , Mr.
Cairo?

Cairo turns his hat over, drops his gloves into it and
places it bottom up, on the corner of the desk. Diamonds
twinkle on the second and third fingers of his left hand.
A ruby, surrounded by diamonds, like the one in his cravat,
is on the third finger of his right hand. Cairo rubs his
palms together, then, in a high-pitched thin voice:
CAIRO
May a stranger offer condolences
for your partner's unfortunate
death?
SPADE
Thanks.
CAIRO
May I ask, Mr. Spade, if there is,
as the newspapers infer, a certain
-- ah -- relationship between that
unfortunate happening and the death
a little later of the man Thursby?
Spade does not reply. When it is obvious to Cairo that
Spade does not mean to answer, he rises and bows.
CAIRO
(punctiliously)
I beg your pardon.
He sits down and puts his hands side-by-side flat on the
corner of the desk.
CAIRO
More than idle curiosity prompted my
question, Mr. Spade. I am trying to
recover an -- ah -- ornament that
has been, shall we say, mislaid. I
thought, and hoped, you could assist
me.
Spade nods once, briefly.
CAIRO
The ornament is a statuette -- the
black figure of a bird.
Spade nods as before.
CAIRO
I am prepared to pay on behalf of
the figure's rightful owner, the sum
of five thousand dollars for its
recovery.

He raises one hand from the desk corner and touches a spot
in the air ever so lightly with his fore-finger.
CAIRO
I am prepared to promise that -what is the phrase? -- "No questions
will be asked."
(he puts his hand
back on the desk
beside the other
and smiles blandly)
SPADE
(thoughtfully)
Five thousand dollars is a lot of
money.
OVER SCENE there is a light rapping on the door.
SPADE

Come in.
The door opens enough to admit Effie Perine's head and
shoulders. She is wearing a small dark felt hat and a

SPADE
No. Goodnight. Lock the door when

EFFIE
Goodnight.

Spade turns in his

SPADE
It's an interesting figure...
The SOUND of the corridor door closing comes OVER scene.
Smiling, Cairo takes a short, compact, flat black pistol
out of an inner pocket.
CAIRO
You will please clasp your hands
together at the back of your neck.

Spade raises his arms, leaning back in his chair,
intertwining the fingers of his two hands behind his head.
His eyes, holding no particular expression, remain focused
on Cairo's dark face. Cairo coughs, a little apologetic
cough, smiles nervously. His dark eyes are humid and
bashful and very earnest.
CAIRO
I intend to search your offices,
Mr. Spade. I warn you that if you
attempt to prevent me, I shall
certainly shoot you.
SPADE
(in a voice as empty
of expression as
his face)
Go ahead.
CAIRO
You will please stand. I shall have
to make sure you are not armed.
Spade gets up, pushing his chair back with his calves as he
straightens his legs. Cairo comes around behind him. He
transfers the pistol from his right hand to his left. He
lifts Spade's coat-tail, looks under it. Holding the
pistol close to Spade's back, he puts his right hand around
Spade's side, pats his chest. His face is no more than six
inches below and behind Spade's right elbow.
Spade's elbow drops as Spade spins to the right. Cairo's
face jerks back but not far enough. Spade's right heel on
the patent-leathered toe anchors the smaller man to the
elbow's path. The elbow strikes him beneath the
cheek-bone.
Spade's right hand closes on the pistol. Cairo lets the
pistol go the instant Spade's fingers touch it. Spade
makes an about-face. With his left hand he gathers
together the smaller man's coat lapels while his right hand
stows the captured weapon away in a coat pocket. His face
is wooden with a trace of sullenness around the mouth.
Spade, by means of his grip on Cairo's lapels, turns him
slowly, pushes him back until he is standing close in front
of the chair he lately occupied. A puzzled look replaces
the look of pain and chagrin on Cairo's face.
Spade smiles. His smile is gentle, even dreamy. His right
shoulder raises a few inches. Then his fist strikes the
edge of Cairo's jaw-bone. Cairo shuts his eyes and is
unconscious.

Spade lowers the limp body into the chair where it lies
with sprawled arms and legs, the head lolling back, the
mouth open. Spade empties the unconscious man's pockets,
one by one, working methodically, making a pile of the
pockets' contents on the desk. When the last pocket has
been turned out, he returns to his chair, rolls and lights
a cigarette and begins to examine his spoils.

CLOSEUP - SPOILS
Spade's fingers open the wallet. It contains several
hundred dollars in United States bills, two five-pound
notes, three much-used Greek passports bearing Cairo's name
and portrait, five folded sheets of onion-skin paper
covered with what looks like Arabic writing, a thin sheaf
of Mr. Joel Cairo's engraved cards, and a ticket for an
orchestra seat at the Geary Theatre.
Besides the wallet and its contents, a wafer-thin platinum
watch, a handful of United States, British, French and
Chinese coins, a package of violet pastille and a large
silk handkerchief with a florid design.

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AND CAIRO
Spade takes the unconscious man's wrist between finger and
thumb. Then, after a moment, he rocks back in his chair
and smokes his cigarette. Cairo moans, flutters his
eyelids presently. Several moments pass before the eyes
remain open, and several more moments before they focus
properly. Then he raises his head from the back of the
chair, looks around the office in confusion, sees Spade,
and sits up. There is a dark bruise where Spade's fist
struck him.
SPADE
Sorry.
(he grins wolfishly)
But imagine my embarrassment when
I found that five thousand dollar
offer was just hooey.
CAIRO
(through his teeth -painfully)
You're mistaken, Mr. Spade. That
was, and is, a genuine offer.
SPADE
(his surprise is genuine)
What the hell?

CAIRO
I am prepared to pay five thousand
dollars for the figure's return.
(he takes his
hand away from
the bruised head,
prim and businesslike again)
You have it?
SPADE
No.
CAIRO
(politely skeptical)
If it is not here, why did you risk
serious injury to prevent my
searching for it?
SPADE
I should sit around and let people
come in and stick me up.
CAIRO
Surely, it is natural enough that I
should first try to spare the owner
such a considerable expense, if
possible.
SPADE
Who is he?
CAIRO
(smiling demurely)
You will have to forgive my not
answering that question.
SPADE
(blinking his eyes
sleepily)
It might be better all around if we
put our cards on the table.
CAIRO
(his voice suave)
I do not think it would be better.
If you know more than I, I shall
profit by your knowledge and so will
you to the extent of five thousand
dollars. If you do not, then I have
made a mistake in coming to you, and
to do as you suggest would be simply
to make that mistake worse.

Spade nods indifferently, waves a hand at the articles on
the desk.
SPADE
There's nothing like five thousand
dollars there.
CAIRO
You wish some assurance of my
sincerity?... A retainer?... Would
that serve?
SPADE
It might.
Cairo puts his hand out toward his wallet, hesitates,
withdraws his hand.
CAIRO
You will take, say one hundred
dollars?
Spade picks up the wallet, takes out bills.
SPADE
(frowning)
Better make it two hundred.
(he does make it
two hundred, then
rocks back in
his chair again)
Your first guess was that I had the
bird...
(shakes his head)
There's nothing to that. What's your
second guess?
CAIRO
That you know where it is. Or, at
least, that you know it is where
you can get it.
SPADE
(his face solemn
except for wrinkles
at the corners of
his eyes)
You're not hiring me to do any
murders or burglaries for you but
simply to get it back, if possible,
in an honest, lawful way.

CAIRO
(also solemn-faced)
If possible. And, in any event, with
discretion.
(he puts his bills
back into his
pockets, then he
picks up his hat)
I am at the Hotel Belvedere when you
wish to communicate with me -- Room
635. I confidently expect the
greatest mutual benefit from our
association, Mr. Spade.
(he hesitates)
May I have my pistol?
Sure.

SPADE
I'd forgotten it.

Spade takes the pistol out of his coat pocket, hands it to
Cairo. Cairo points the pistol at Spade's chest.
CAIRO
(earnestly)
You will please keep your hands on
top of the desk. I intend to search
your office.
SPADE
Well, I'll be...
(then he laughs
in his throat)
All right -- go ahead.
you.

I won't stop

Spade, looking on, smiles pleasantly as Cairo moves quickly
to his task. Drawers and filing cabinets are opened. He
looks behind curtains and under the seats of the three
office chairs and into the wastebasket. He even opens the
window and looks along the lighted window ledge. Finding
nothing, he sighs a little sigh of disappointment. Then,
turning back to Spade, he bows politely.
CAIRO
Thank you very much, Mr. Spade...
I shall await your call.
And he is gone. Among other things that Cairo's search
uncovers is a bottle of Bacardi. Spade reaches for it,
fills a lily cup two-thirds full, drinks.
SPADE
(to himself)
Anyway, they're paying for it.

He fills the cup again, drinks, returns the bottle to the
drawer, then rising, puts on his hat and overcoat and
starts turning off the lights.

Oh!

had not been
entirely certain
of his coming)
Mr. Spade! Come in.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SPADE AND BRIGID
as they enter.
BRIGID
(taking Spade's hat
and coat)
Do you bring me any news?
(MORE)

BRIGID (CONT'D)
(anxiety looks
through her eyes
and she holds
her breath)
I mean, did you manage it so that
the police won't have to know
about me?
SPADE
They won't for a while anyway.
Brigid sighs happily, sits on the walnut settee, her face
relaxed and her body relaxed. She smiles up at him with
admiring eyes, then at another thought, the admiration goes
out of her eyes and the anxious worried look returns.
BRIGID
You won't get into any trouble?
SPADE
I don't mind a reasonable amount
of trouble.
She makes room for him on the settee, just as she did on
the last occasion.
BRIGID
Do sit down.
But Spade remains beside the fireplace, looking at her with
eyes that frankly study, weigh and judge her. She flushes
with becoming shyness under his scrutiny. He stands until
it seems plain that he means to ignore her invitation -then he crosses to the settee.
SPADE
You aren't exactly the sort of
person you pretend to be, are you?
She starts slightly, then averts her face.
BRIGID
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
SPADE
School girl manner, stammering,
blushing and all that.
Her face turns slowly until her eyes meet his.

BRIGID
(voice hushed, almost
to a whisper)
I haven't lived a good life. I've
been bad -- worse than you could know.
SPADE
That's good...! Because if you
actually were as innocent as you
seemed to be, we'd never get
anywhere.
BRIGID
I won't be innocent.
SPADE
Good.
(then in the
manner of one
making polite
conversation)
I saw Joel Cairo tonight.
Brigid's eyes focused on his profile, become frightened,
then cautious. Spade's legs are stretched out and he is
looking at his crossed feet. His face has a blank
expression.
BRIGID
(uneasily)
You -- you know him?
SPADE
(maintaining his light
conversational tone)
Only slightly.
She gets up from the settee, goes to the fireplace to poke
at the fire. She changes the position of an ornament on
the mantelpiece, crosses the room to get a box of
cigarettes from a table in the corner, straightens a
curtain, and returns to her seat.
SPADE
(grins sideways at her)
You're good. You're very good.
BRIGID
What did he say?
SPADE
About what?

BRIGID
(hesitatingly)
About me.
SPADE
Nothing.
(he turns to hold his
lighter under the end
of her cigarette)
BRIGID
Well, what did he talk about?
(with half playful
petulance)
SPADE
He offered me five thousand dollars
for the black bird.
Brigid starts, throws a swift alarmed look at Spade, then
rises again.
SPADE
You're not going to go around poking
at the fire and straightening the
room again, are you?
(he laughs lazily)
Brigid's laughter mingles with his. She drops her
cigarette into a tray and looks at him with clear, merry
eyes.
BRIGID
No, I won't... and what did you say?
SPADE
Five thousand dollars is a lot of
money.
She smiles but instead of smiling too, he looks gravely at
her. Her smile becomes faint, confused. Then she stops
smiling, lifts her shoulders and hands and lets them fall
in a gesture that accepts defeat.
BRIGID
It is. It is far more than I could
ever offer you if I must bid for
your loyalty.
Spade laughs.

His laughter is brief and somewhat bitter.

SPADE
That's good -- coming from you.
What have you given me besides
money? Have you given me any of
your confidence? Any of the truth?
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty
with money and nothing else?
BRIGID
I've given you all the money I have.
(tears glisten
in her eyes,
her voice is
hoarse, vibrant)
I've thrown myself on your mercy -told you that without your help I'm
utterly lost.
(she turns on
him suddenly -cries in a
vibrant voice)
What else is there that I can buy
you with?
Spade takes her face between his hands, kisses her mouth
roughly and contemptuously, then releasing her, he sits
back. She sits, holding her face where his hands left it.
Spade gets up, takes two steps towards the fireplace,
halts. Brigid doesn't move. He turns to face her.
SPADE
I don't care what your secrets are
-- but I can't go ahead without more
confidence in you than I have now.
You've got to convince me that you
know what it's all about -- that you
aren't simply fiddling along hoping
it'll all come out right in the end.
BRIGID
Can't you trust me a little longer?
SPADE
How much is a little?

She bites her lip, looks down.
BRIGID
(almost inaudibly)
I must talk to Joel Cairo.

SPADE
You can see him tonight.
(looks at his watch)
He's at the theatre. It'll be out
soon. I'll call his hotel.
(crosses room -picks up telephone)
BRIGID
(eyes alarmed)
But he can't come here. I can't let
him know where I am. I'm afraid.
SPADE
(dials a number)
My place then.
She hesitates, working her lips together.
BRIGID
(finally)
All right.
SPADE
(into phone)
I want to leave a message for Mr.
Joel Cairo.

EXT. SPADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A dark sedan is parked directly in front of the entrance.
A taxicab pulls up behind the dark sedan.

CLOSE SHOT - TAXICAB

stands waiting for him while he pays the driver, CAMERA
DOLLIES with Spade as he comes up beside her. Iva Archer
is alone in the dark sedan, sitting at the wheel. Spade
lifts his hat to her but says nothing. He and Brigid go
into the apartment house. Looking after them, Iva's face
is strained, tense. Spade comes back out of the apartment
house, crosses quickly to the sedan.

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AND IVA
Frowning, Spade returns his gaze to Iva's insistent
face.
SPADE
What's the matter? Has anything
happened? You oughtn't to be here
at this time of night.

IVA
(quarrelsomely)
I'm beginning to believe that. You
told me I oughtn't to come to your
office. Now I oughtn't to come here.
Do you mean I oughtn't to... chase
after you? If that's what you mean,
why don't you say it right out?
SPADE
(with a certain false
emphasis)
Now, Iva, you've got no right to
take that attitude.
He looks away from her down the street, frown
slightly.

LONG SHOT - STREET
In front of the garage on the corner, an undersized youth
in a neat gray cap and overcoat is loafing back against a
wall.

IVA
I know I haven't. I haven't any
rights at all, it seems, where
you're concerned. I thought I did.
I thought you pretended to love
me...
SPADE
(wearily)
This is no time to be arguing about
that, Precious. What was it you
wanted to see me about?
IVA
I can't talk to you here, Sam.
I come in?

Can't

Spade shakes his head.
IVA
Who is she?...
Spade says nothing. She makes a thin line of her mouth,
squirms around behind the wheel and starts the engine.
SPADE
Goodnight, Iva.

She engages the gears violently, the car jumps ahead.
Spade turns back toward the apartment house.

INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT HOUSE

Brigid rises from the bench as Spade enters. He goes to
the run-yourself elevator, opens the door for her to pass
in.

seem all irises and his high-pitched, thin-voiced words
start tumbling out as he enters.
CAIRO
There is a boy outside who seems
to be watching the house, Mr. Spade.
I know.

SPADE
I spotted him.

The girl comes into the passageway behind Spade.
BRIGID
(anxiously)
What boy? What is that?

SPADE
(unconcerned)
I don't know -- a kid -- he's been
tailing me around town all evening
... Come on in, Cairo.
Brigid grasps Sam's arm above the elbow tensely.
BRIGID
(breathlessly)
Did he follow you to my apartment?
No.

SPADE
I shook him before that.

She breathes again.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SPADE'S APARTMENT
as Spade leads the way in, Cairo, holding his black hat to
his belly with both hands, bows stiffly.
CAIRO
I'm delighted to see you again,
Miss O'Shaughnessy.
BRIGID
(offering him her hand)
I was sure you would be, Joel.
He takes her hand, makes another formal bow over it, then
releases it quickly. She goes to the padded rocker she had
occupied before. Cairo takes the armchair by the table.
Spade, after hanging Cairo's hat and coat up, sits on the
edge of the sofa in front of the window, begins to roll a
cigarette.
BRIGID
(to Cairo)
Mr. Spade told me about your offer
for the Falcon. How soon can you
have the money ready?
CAIRO
(eyebrows twitching)
It is ready.
He smiles, showing teeth too white and too even, then he
looks at Spade. Spade is lighting a cigarette.
BRIGID
In cash?

CAIRO
(primly)
Oh yes.
BRIGID
You are ready to give us five
thousand dollars if we turn over
the Falcon to you?
CAIRO
(holding up a
wriggling hand)
Excuse me, I expressed myself badly.
I did not mean to say that I have
the money in my pocket but that I am
prepared to get it on a few minutes
notice at any time during banking
hours.
BRIGID
Oh.
SPADE
(grins wolfishly
through smoke)
That's probably right. He had only
a few hundred in his wallet when I
frisked him this afternoon.
Brigid's eyes open wide.
CAIRO
(trying, and failing,
to keep eagerness
out of his voice)
I shall be able to give you the
money at, say, half-past ten in the
morning.
BRIGID
But I haven't got the Falcon.
Cairo puts a hand on either arm of his chair, holds his
small-boned body erect and stiff.
BRIGID
(quickly)
I'll have it in another week at the
most though.
CAIRO
(with bitter skepticism)
Where is it?

BRIGID
Where Floyd hid it.
Floyd?

CAIRO
Thursby?

She nods.
CAIRO
And you know where he hid it?
She nods again.
CAIRO
Then why must we wait a week?
BRIGID
Perhaps not a whole week.
Cairo rubs the back of one hand with the palm of the other.
His lids lower to shade his eyes.
CAIRO
Why, if I may ask another question,
are you willing to sell it to me?
BRIGID
I'm afraid -- after what happened
to Floyd. I'm afraid to touch it
except to turn it over to somebody
else right away.
If Spade feels either excitement or curiosity, he does not
betray it. Lounging on the sofa, he takes an occasional
drag at his cigarette between occasional sips of rum.
CAIRO
(leaning forward -his voice low)
Exactly what did happen to Floyd?
BRIGID
The fat man.
CAIRO
(clicks his pearly teeth)
Is he here?
BRIGID
I don't know. I suppose so.

What

Cairo rearranges his hand in his lap so that, intentionally
or not, a forefinger points at Spade.
CAIRO
It might make a world of difference.
The girl glances at the pointed finger, makes an impatient
motion with her head.
BRIGID
...Or me or you.
CAIRO
Precisely... And shall we add, more
certainly the boy outside.
BRIGID
Yes.

But you might be able to get around

Istanbul -- What was his name?...
Cairo's face is suddenly distorted.
enraged voice.

He cries in a shrill,

CAIRO
You mean the one you couldn't get
to come to...
Before he can finish, Brigid is out of her chair. As Cairo
starts to rise, her right hand goes out, cracks sharply
against his cheek. Cairo grunts, raises his hand to strike
back.
Spade, wooden of face, is up from the sofa by now and close
to them. He catches Cairo by the throat, chokes him.
Cairo gurgles, puts a hand inside his coat. Spade grasps
the Greek's wrist, twists it until the fingers open and the
black pistol drops to the rug. Brigid quickly picks up the
pistol.
CAIRO
(hoarsely)
This is the second time you've put
your hands on me!
Cairo's eyes bulge slightly as Spade tightens the throttling
pressure on his throat.

SPADE
(growling)
Yes -- and when you're slapped,
you'll take it and like it!
He releases Cairo's wrist and with a thick, open hand
strikes the side of his face three times savagely. Cairo
tries to spit in his face. Spade slaps him again across
the mouth.
OVER SCENE the buzzer sounds. Cairo's eyes jerk to the
passageway that leads to the corridor door. The girl gasps
and turns to face the passageway. Spade stares gloomily
for a moment at the blood trickling from Cairo's lip, then
steps back, taking his hand from the Greek's throat.
Brigid comes close to Spade, whispers.
BRIGID
Who is it?
Cairo's eyes jerk back from the passageway to Spade and ask
the same question.
SPADE
(irritably)
I don't know.
The buzzer sounds again, more insistently.
SPADE
Well, keep quiet.
CAMERA TROLLIES ahead of him as he enters the passageway,

Hello. You guys pick swell hours
to do your visiting in. What is
it this time?
DUNDY
(quietly)
We want to talk to you, Spade.

Spade remains in the doorway, blocking it.
SPADE
Go ahead and talk.
POLHAUS
We don't have to do it out here
in the hall, do we?
SPADE
(in a slightly
apologetic tone)
You can't come in.
POLHAUS
(putting his big
hand playfully
on Spade's chest)
Come off it, Sam.
Spade braces himself against the hand, grins wolfishly.
SPADE
Going to strong-arm me, Tom?
POLHAUS
(grumbling)
Be reasonable, Sam.
DUNDY
(through his teeth)
It'd pay you to play along with
us a little, Spade. You got away
with this and you got away with
that -- but you can't keep it up
forever.
SPADE
(arrogantly)
Stop me when you can.
DUNDY
That's what I intend to do!
He puts his hands behind him, thrusts his hard face up
towards Spade's.
DUNDY
There's talk going around about you
and Archer's wife. Anything to it?
SPADE
Not anything.

DUNDY
The talk is that she tried to get
a divorce out of him so she could
put in with you but he wouldn't
give it to her. Anything to that?
SPADE
No.
DUNDY
(stolidly)
There's even talk that that's why
he was put on the spot.
SPADE
Don't be a hog, Dundy. Your first
idea that I killed Thursby off
because he killed Miles, falls to
pieces if you blame me for killing
Miles too.
DUNDY
You haven't heard me say you killed
anybody. You're the one who keeps
bringing that up.
SPADE
Haven't you anything better to do
than popping in here early every
morning with a lot of fool
questions?
DUNDY
(adds deliberately)
-- And get lying answers!
SPADE
(warningly)
Take it easy...
Dundy looks him up and down, then straight in the eye.
DUNDY
If you say there was nothing between
you and Archer's wife, you're a liar
and I'm telling you so!
SPADE
(moistening his lips)
Is that the hot tip that brought you
here at this ungodly time of night?

DUNDY
That's one of them.
SPADE
And the other?
DUNDY
(in a cold, level voice)
Let us in!
Spade frowns, hakes his head.
DUNDY
(starts buttoning
his overcoat)
All right, Spade, we'll see. Maybe
you're right in bucking us. Think
it over.
OVER SCENE Joel Cairo's voice, high and thin, cries.
CAIRO'S VOICE
(over scene)
Help! Police! Help!
Dundy, who was turning away, confronts Spade again. OVER
SCENE the SOUND of a brief struggle, of a blow, of a
subdued cry.
DUNDY
(decisively)
I guess we're going in!
SPADE
I guess you are.
Dundy and Polhaus push past him into the passageway.
CAMERA TROLLIES after them as they open the door to the
living room, enter.

INT. LIVING ROOM
Brigid O'Shaughnessy is huddled in an armchair by the
table, her arms over her face. Her eyes are whitecircled, terrified. Joel Cairo stands in front of her,
bending over her, holding in one hand the flat, black
pistol. His other hand is clapped to his forehead. Blood
runs through the fingers of that hand and down into his
eyes.

Cairo does not heed the detectives. He is glaring at the
girl huddled in front of him. His lips are working
spasmodically but no coherent sound comes from between
them. Dundy, the first of the three into the living room,
moves swiftly to Cairo's side, puts a hand on his own hip
under his overcoat and a hand on Cairo's wrist.
DUNDY
(growling)
What are you up to here?
Cairo takes the re-smeared hand from his head, flourishes
it.
CAIRO
(cries)
This is what she has done.
at it!

Look

Uncovered, his forehead shows a three-inch ragged tear.
DUNDY
(to the girl)
Did you do that?
She looks at Spade with appealing eyes. He does not in any
way respond, but leans against the door frame with the
polite, detached air of a disinterested spectator.
BRIGID
(to Dundy -- in
a low throbbing
voice)
I had to. I was all alone in here
with him. He attacked me. I
tried to keep him off. I -- I
couldn't make myself shoot him.
CAIRO
(cries)
Oh, you dirty, filthy liar!
(facing Dundy)
I came in here in good faith and
was attacked by both of them. And
when you came, he went out to talk
with you, leaving her here with this
pistol. And then she said they were
going to kill me after you left -and I called for help so you wouldn't
leave me here to be murdered. And
then she struck me with the pistol.

BRIGID
(shrilly)
Make him tell the truth -- why don't
you?
She takes two steps to Cairo and Dundy, slaps Cairo on the
cheek. Cairo yells inarticulately. Dundy pushes the girl
back into the chair, growls:
DUNDY
None of that now!
Brigid puts her leg out and kicks Cairo, the high heel of
her blue slipper striking him just below the knee. Polhaus
comes over to stand close beside her.
POLHAUS
(grumbling)
Behave, sister. That's no way to
act.
Dundy stares at Spade.

His eyes are hard, bright discs.

DUNDY
(to Polhaus)
Well, Tom, don't guess we'll go
wrong pulling the lot of them in.
Polhaus nods gloomily. Spade leaves the door, advances
to the center of the room, dropping his cigarette in a
tray on the table as he passes. His smile is amiable,
his manner composed.
SPADE
Don't be in a hurry, boys.
Everything can be explained.
DUNDY
(sneering)
I bet.
Spade bows to the girl.
SPADE
Miss O'Shaughnessy, may I present
Lieutenant Dundy and Detective
Sergeant Polhaus.
(he bows to Dundy)
Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative
in my employ -- since yesterday.
CAIRO
(interrupting indignantly)
That isn't so. She --

SPADE
(in a loud voice)
This is Mr. Joel Cairo, an
acquaintance of Thursby's. He came
to my office this afternoon to hire
me to find something Thursby was
supposed to have on him when he was
bumped off. It looked funny the way
he put it to me so I wouldn't touch
it. Then he pulled a gun -- well,
never mind that unless it comes to
the point of laying charges against
each other. Anyway, after talking
it over with Miss O'Shaughnessy, I
thought maybe I could get something
out of him about Miles' and Thursby's
killings so I asked him up here.
Maybe we put the questions to him a
little rough, but he wasn't hurt
enough to cry for help.
As Spade talks, anxiety comes into Cairo's blood-stained
face. His eyes move jerkily up and down, shifting their
focus uneasily between the floor and Spade's bland face.
DUNDY
(to Cairo -- brusquely
-- demanding)
Well, what have you to say to that?
Cairo stares at the Lieutenant's face for a long moment.
When he lifts his eyes, they are sly and wary.
CAIRO
(murmurs)
I don't know -- what to say.
DUNDY
Try telling the facts.
CAIRO
(fidgeting)
The facts?
DUNDY
Quit stalling! All you gotta do
is swear to a complaint that they
took a poke at you and we'll throw
them into the can.

SPADE
(affably)
Go ahead, Cairo. Tell him you'll
do it -- and then we'll swear to a
complaint against you and he'll
have the lot of us.
Cairo clears his throat, looks nervously around the room.
DUNDY
Get your hats!
Spade winks at Cairo broadly, crosses to the padded rocker,
sits down. He laughs.
SPADE
(nothing but delight
in his voice)
Well, boys and girls, we put it
over nicely.
DUNDY
(peremptorily)
Get your hats!
SPADE
Don't you know when you're being
kidded?
DUNDY
(rises, moving stiffly)
No, but we'll let that wait till
we get down to the station.
SPADE
Wake up -- you're being kidded.
When the bell rang, I said to Miss
O'Shaughnessy here and Cairo -- It's
those bulls again. They're getting
to be nuisances. When you hear them
going, one of you scream and then
we'll see how far we can string them
along until they tumble.
Brigid O'Shaughnessy bends forward in her chair, laughs
merrily. Cairo starts, then smiles. He holds the smile
fixed on her face.
POLHAUS
(grumbling)
Cut it out, Sam.

DUNDY
(scornfully)
The cut on his head -- where'd it
come from?
CAIRO
I fell -- we intended to be
struggling for the pistol when you
came in and I tripped on the end of
the rug and fell.
DUNDY
Horse Feathers!
He pulls Cairo roughly around, holding him now by one wrist
and the nape of his neck.
DUNDY
I'll take you along for packing the
gun anyway.
SPADE
Don't be a sap, Dundy. The gun was
part of the plant. It's one of mine.
(he laughs)
Too bad it's only a .32 or maybe you
could find it was the one Thursby
and Miles were shot with.
Dundy releases Cairo, spins on his heel, his right fist
clicks on Spade's chin. The girl utters a short cry.
Spade's smile flickers out. He steadies himself with a
short, backward step and his thick, sloping shoulders
writhe under his coat. Before his fist can come up, Tom
Polhaus has pushed himself between the two men.
POLHAUS
(begging)
No, Sam -- no.
After a long moment of motionlessness, Spade's muscles
relax.
SPADE
(sullenly)
Then get him out of here quick!
Dundy's fists are clenched in front of his body, his feet
are planted firm, a little apart on the floor.
DUNDY
Get their names and addresses.

Polhaus turns toward Cairo.
CAIRO
(quickly)
Joel Cairo -- Hotel Belvedere.
SPADE
Miss O'Shaughnessy's address is
in care of my office.
Dundy takes a step forward, halting in front of the girl.
DUNDY
Where do you live?
SPADE
(to Tom -- flinging
the words out)
Get him out of here! I've had
enough of this.
POLHAUS
(mumbling)
Take it easy, Sam.
(buttoning his
coat, he turns
to Dundy)
Well, is that all?
Dundy's scowl fails to conceal indecision.
CAIRO
(moving suddenly
toward the door)
I'm going too -- if Mr. Spade will
be kind enough to give me my hat
and coat.
SPADE
What's the hurry?
CAIRO
No hurry -- but it's quite late
and...
Spade goes to the closet in the passageway, takes out
Cairo's hat and coat, hands them to him, then to Polhaus:
SPADE
Tell him to leave the gun.

Dundy takes Cairo's Pistol from his overcoat pocket, puts
it on the table. He goes out first, with Cairo at his
heels. Polhaus halts in front of Spade.
POLHAUS
(mutters)
I hope you know what you're doing,
Sam.
Getting no response, he follows the others out. Spade
waits at the door of the passageway until the corridor door
closes, then turns back into the room. He sits on the
sofa, elbows on knees, cheeks in hands, looking at the
floor. Brigid leaves her chair and comes over to the sofa
to sit beside Spade.
BRIGID
You're absolutely the wildest
person I've ever known. Do you
always carry on so high-handed?
Spade turns on the sofa to face her.
SPADE
Now you've had your talk with Cairo.
Now you can talk to me.
BRIGID
Oh, yes -- of course.
She smoothes her dress down over her knees, then she frowns
at her knees. Spade puts an arm across her back, cupping
his hand over the small, bare shoulder farthest from him.
SPADE
I'm listening.

Well?

She turns her head to smile up at him with playful
impudence.
BRIGID
Do you need your arm there for that?
SPADE
No.
(he takes it away)
BRIGID
(murmurs)
You're altogether unpredictable.
SPADE
I'm still listening.

Brigid wriggles a finger at the alarm clock perched on top
of the book. Its clumsy hands say 2:50.
BRIGID
Oh, look at the time!
(rising)
I must go.
SPADE
(shaking his head)
Not until you've told me about it.
BRIGID
(gaily)
Am I a prisoner?
SPADE
Maybe that kid outside hasn't gone
home yet.
BRIGID
(her gaiety vanishes)
Do you think he's still there?
SPADE
It's likely.
She shivers.
SPADE
You can start now.
BRIGID
You're the most insistent person
(sips her drink)
SPADE
Yes... and wild and unpredictable.
What's the bird, this falcon -- that
everybody's all steamed up about?
Brigid studies a small crescent her lips have left on the
brim of the glass. Then:
BRIGID
Suppose I wouldn't tell you anything
at all about it? What would you do?
(mockery ripples
in a smile on
her face)
Something wild and unpredictable?
SPADE
Maybe.

BRIGID
(wrinkles her
pale forehead)
It's a black figure, as you know,
smooth and shiny, of a bird, a hawk
or falcon about that high -(she holds her
hands a foot
apart)
SPADE
What makes it so important?
BRIGID
(shakes her head)
I don't know. They wouldn't tell
me. But they promised me five
hundred pounds if I helped them
get it from the man who had it.
SPADE
That was in Istanbul?
BRIGID
(hesitates -- then:)
Marmora.
SPADE
Go ahead.
BRIGID
But that's all. They promised me
five hundred pounds to help them
and I did. And then we found that
Joel Cairo meant to desert us, taking
the Falcon with him and leaving
Floyd and me nothing. So we did
exactly that to him. But then I
wasn't any better off than before
because Floyd hadn't any intention
of keeping his promise to me about
sharing equally. I had learned that
by the time we got here.
(indignation darkens
her eyes)
SPADE
(scowling at her)
What's the bird made of?

BRIGID
Porcelain or black stone -- I don't
know. I only saw it once for a few
minutes. Floyd showed it to me when
we first got hold of it.
SPADE
(casually)
Your are a liar.
She gets up and stands at the end of the table looking
down at him with dark abashed eyes.
BRIGID
I've always been a

I am a liar.
liar.

SPADE
(good-humoredly)
Don't brag about it. Was there any
truth at all in that yarn?
BRIGID
(lowers her head
slightly -- whispers)
Some... Not very much.
Spade rises, crosses to her. He puts his hand under her
chin, lifts her head. Her eyes are damp. He laughs into
them.
SPADE
We've got all night before us. I'll
put some coffee on and we'll try
again.
BRIGID
(her eyelids droop)
Oh -- I'm so tired.
(then tremulously)
So tired... of lying and thinking
up lies and not knowing what is a
lie and what is the truth. I wish
I...
She puts her hands up to Spade's cheeks, her mouth hard
against his mouth -- her body flat against his body.
Spade's arms go around her, holding her to him. Muscles
bulge his sleeves as his hand cradles her head, his fingers
lost among her hair.
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

CLOSEUP - CURVED BRONZE PLAQUE
on a stone pillar which reads:
HOTEL BELVEDERE

INT. BELVEDERE LOBBY
as Spade enters, goes toward the desk past a large divan.
The undersized youth, in gray clothes, is sitting on the
divan apparently reading a newspaper.

CLOSE SHOT - DESK
as Spade picks up the house telephone.
SPADE
(into phone)
Mr. Joel Cairo, please.
Waiting, he shifts around to face the divan. The boy
appears to be altogether engrossed in his newspaper. A few
moments more and Spade says "Thank you" into the phone,
puts it down and starts across the lobby.

CLOSE SHOT - THE DIVAN
Spade comes into scene, sits down beside the youth. The
youth does not look up from his newspaper although Spade,
who is no more than a foot away from the young man, stares
openly at him. His features are small, in keeping with his
stature, and regular. His skin is very fair. His clothing
is neither new nor of better than ordinary quality. Spade
takes out paper and tobacco.
SPADE
(casually)
Where is he?
(he packs tobacco
into the paper
curved to catch it)
The boy lowers his newspaper with a purposeful sort of
slowness, looks with small eyes at Spade's chest.

BOY
(in a voice as
colorless and
composed and
cold as his
young face)
What?
SPADE
(busy with his
cigarette)
Where is he?
BOY
Who?
SPADE
Cairo.
The boy's gaze goes up Spade's chest, to the knot in his
tie, rests there.
BOY
What do you think you're doing,
Jack? Kidding me?
Spade licks his cigarette, smiles amiably.
SPADE
I'll tell you when I am... New York,
aren't you?
The boys stares at Spade's tie for a moment longer, then
goes back to his newspaper.
BOY
(from the side of
his mouth)
Shove off.
Spade lights his cigarette, leans back comfortably on the
divan.
SPADE
You'll have to talk to me before
you're through, Sonny -- some of
you will -- and you can tell the
fat man I said so.
The boy puts his paper down quickly, faces Spade, stares
at his necktie with small, bleak eyes. His small hands
are spread flat over his belly.

BOY
Keep asking for it and you're
going to get it -- plenty.
(his voice is
low, flat and
menacing)
I told you to shove off -- shove
off.
SPADE
People lose teeth talking like that.
If you want to hang around, you'll
be polite.
Spade drops his cigarette into a tall stone jar beside the
divan, lifts his hand, catching the attention of a man
standing beside the cigar stand.

MED. LONG SHOT - CIGAR STAND
The man nods, comes towards them. He is middle-aged,
medium height, round and sallow of face, compactly built.

TWO SHOT - SPADE AND LUKE
LUKE
(coming up)
Hello, Sam.
Spade rises.
SPADE
Hello, Luke.
They shake hands.
LUKE
Say, that's too bad about Miles.
Uh-huh.

SPADE
A bad break.

He jerks his head toward the boy on the divan.
SPADE
What do you let these cheap gunmen
hang out in your lobby for with
their tools bulging in their
clothes?
Luke examines the boy with crafty, brown eyes set in a
suddenly hard face.

LUKE
(to boy)
What do you want here?
The boy rises, looks at the necktie of the two men -- from
one to the other. He looks like a school boy standing in
front of them.
LUKE
(belligerently)
Well, if you don't want anything,
beat it -- and don't come back.
BOY
(quietly)
I won't forget you guys.
He walks away from them toward the swinging door.
removes his hat, wipes his damp forehead with a
handkerchief.

LUKE
(his eyes on the
boy's retreating
figure)
What is it?
SPADE
No idea.
(takes a deep breath
-- lets it out)
I just happened to spot him.
As the boy goes out the revolving door, Cairo enters.
SPADE
See you, Luke.
He turns away from the house detective, goes quickly toward
Cairo.

CLOSE SHOT - CAIRO
Seeing Spade, he halts, draws his body up straight.

CAIRO
(without enthusiasm)
Good morning.
There is a pause.
SPADE
Let's go somewhere where we can
talk.
CAIRO
(raises his chin)
Please excuse me. Our private
conversations have not been such
that I am anxious to continue them.
Pardon my speaking bluntly but it
is the truth.
SPADE
You mean last night?
(makes an impatient gesture)
What else could I do? I had to
throw in with her. I don't know
where the bird is. You don't. She
does. How are we going to get it if
I don't play along with her?
CAIRO
(dubiously)
You have always, I must say, a
smooth explanation ready.
SPADE
(scowling)
What do you want me to do?
to stutter?
He leads the way over to the divan.

CAMERA TROLLIES AHEAD

SPADE
Dundy take you down to the station?
CAIRO
Yes.
SPADE
How long did they work on you?
CAIRO
(pain and indignation
mix in face and voice)
Until a very little while ago...

SPADE
What did they get out of you?
CAIRO
(primly)
Not a single thing. I adhered to
the course you indicated earlier
in your rooms... I certainly wish
you had devised a more reasonable
story. I felt distinctly ridiculous
repeating it.
SPADE
(grins)
Don't worry about the story's
goofiness. A sensible one would
have had us all in the cooler... You
sure you didn't give them anything?
CAIRO
You may rely upon it. I did not.
SPADE
(rising)
You'll want sleep if you've been
standing up under a police storm
all night. See you later.
He turns abruptly away.
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SPADE'S OFFICE
Effie Perine is on the telephone as Spade enters.
EFFIE
(into telephone)
No, not yet.
She looks around at Spade and her lips shape a silent
"Iva". Spade shakes his head.
EFFIE
(into telephone)
Yes, I'll have him call you as soon
as he comes in.
(she replaces the
receiver on prong
-- to Spade)
That's the third time she's called
this morning.

Spade makes an impatient, growling noise.
EFFIE
(moves her eyes
to indicate the
inner office)
Miss O'Shaughnessy's in there.
Spade nods as if he expected that.
SPADE
What else?
EFFIE
The District Attorney's office
called. Bryan would like to see
you...
Spade grunts as if he'd expected that, too.
EFFIE
...And a Mr. Gutman called. When I
told him you weren't in, he said -"Will you please tell him that the
young man gave me his message, and
that I phoned and will phone again."
Spade works his lips together, as if tasting something he
likes.
SPADE
Thanks, darling.

Gutman, huh?

He opens the door to his private office and goes in.

INT. SPADE'S PRIVATE OFFICE
Brigid O'Shaughnessy, dressed as on her first visit to the
office, rises from a chair beside his desk, comes quickly
towards him.
BRIGID
(exclaims)
Somebody's been in my apartment!
It's all upside down -- every which
way. I changed as fast as I could
and came away. Oh, you must have
let that boy follow you there.
SPADE
(shakes his head)
No, angel -- I shook him before I
went to your place.
(MORE)

SPADE (CONT'D)
(he frowns)
I wonder if it could have been Cairo?
He wasn't at his hotel all night.
He told me he'd been standing up under
a police grilling all night. I wonder!
She looks at him with cloudy eyes.
BRIGID
You went to see Joel this morning?
SPADE
Yes.
BRIGID
(hesitates)
Why?
SPADE
(smiles down at her)
Because, my own true love, I've got
to keep in some sort of touch with
all the loose ends of this dizzy
affair if I'm ever going to make
heads or tails of it.
He puts an arm around her shoulders, leads her over to his
swivel chair, lightly kisses the tip of her nose and sets
her down.
SPADE
Now, we've got to find a new home
for you, haven't we?
BRIGID
(emphatically)
I won't go back there.
SPADE
(after a moment's thought)
I think I've got it. Wait a minute.

INT. OUTER OFFICE
Spade opens the door, enters, shuts the door.
SPADE
(to Effie)
What does your woman's intuition
tell you about her?
(he cocks a head at
the door marked
"Private")

EFFIE
(immediately)
She's all right. Maybe it's her
own fault for being in whatever the
trouble is -- but she's all right -if that's what you mean.
SPADE
That's what I mean... Are you strong
enough for her to put her up for a
few days?
EFFIE
You mean at home?
Spade nods.
EFFIE
(leans forward)
Is she in any danger, Sam?
SPADE
I think she is.
Effie scratches her lip with a fingernail.
EFFIE
That would scare Mom into a green
hemorrhage. I'll have to say she's
a surprise witness or something that
you're keeping undercover until the
last minute.
SPADE
(pats her head)
You're a darling!
He opens the door to his inner office, smiles across the
threshold at Brigid.
SPADE
Effie here, is going to put you up
for a few days, darling.
Brigid, coming out of the door, turns grateful eyes on
Effie.
BRIGID
That's very kind of you.
SPADE
(to Effie)
Better start now.

Effie starts putting on her hat.
SPADE
Go out the back entrance. There's
usually a cab parked by the alleyway.
(to Effie)
You ride part way with her -- over
the bridge -- and make sure you
aren't followed. Better change cabs
a couple of times just to be on the
safe side.
EFFIE
(reaching for the phone)
I'll give Mom a ring.
SPADE
Time enough for that when you get
back.
Effie puts down the telephone.
SPADE
(to Brigid)
Call you later.
Effie and Brigid go out.

Spade goes into his inner office.

INT. PRIVATE OFFICE
Spade sits down at his desk, dials a number on the
telephone.
SPADE
(after a short pause
-- into phone)
Hello... This is Samuel Spade. My
secretary got a phone message that
Mr. Bryan wanted to see me. Will
you ask him what time is the most
conven- ient for him?... Yes...
Spade... S-p-a-d-e.
There is the SOUND of the outer office door opening,
followed by footsteps. Then Iva Archer enters, closes the
door to the private office behind her.
SPADE
(into phone)
Yes... two-thirty... All right,
thanks.
(hangs up)

He pushes the telephone away, rises.
SPADE
Hello, honey.
Iva stands just inside the door wadding a black-bordered
handkerchief in her small gloved hands, peering into his
face with frightened, red and swollen eyes.
IVA
(in a choked voice)
Oh Sam! Forgive me!... Forgive me!
Spade starts to frown, then makes his face a blank.
IVA
(wails)
I sent those policemen to your place
last night. I was mad -- crazy with
jealousy -- and I phoned them that
if they'd go there, they'd learn
something about Miles' murder.
SPADE
What made you think of that?
IVA
I was mad, Sam... I wanted to hurt
you.
SPADE
Did you tell them who you were when
you phoned?
IVA
No... Oh, Sam, dearest... I...
SPADE
Where did you phone from?
IVA
The drugstore across from your place.
SPADE
(pats her shoulder)
It was a dumb trick all right but
it's done now. You'd better run on
home and think of things to tell the
police. You'll be hearing from
them... By the way, where were you
the night Miles was shot?

IVA
(with no hesitation)
Home.
Spade shakes his head, grinning at her.
IVA
I was.
SPADE
No. But if that's your story, it's
all right with me.
IVA
I'm not lying to you, Sam.
Spade's face wears an expression of polite doubt.
her handkerchief, opens it, wads it again, then:
IVA
(voice husky)
When he came home for dinner that
evening, he told me he had a date
with a girl at the St. Mark and
that this was my chance to get the
divorce I wanted. At first I
thought he was just making it up to
try and hurt me. But... well... you
knew Miles. It would have been like
him to...
SPADE
I knew Miles...
IVA
I drove down to the St. Mark and
just as I got there, he came out and
started up the street. I followed
him. In a little while I could see
he was shadowing a man and a girl -so I went back and got in the car
and went up to your apartment but
you weren't home.
SPADE
What time was that?
IVA
About half-past nine... the first
time.
SPADE
The first time?

Iva wads

IVA
I went to a movie and when it was
over, I went home. Miles hadn't
come in yet so I took the car out of
the garage again and went back to
your place but you weren't in.
SPADE
(smiling)
I was looking down at Miles' corpse,
precious... Go on.
IVA
Then I went home and while I was
undressing, your secretary came
with the news of his death.
SPADE
What a swell lot of merry-go-round
riding that was!
She puts the wadded handkerchief to her eyes. Spade
reaches out, pats her arm. She puts her arms around him.
IVA
Do you forgive me for what I did?
SPADE
Sure I do. Now run along.
(he turns her
around to face
the door)
Beat it.
Iva goes out. Spade goes behind the partition in the
corner of the office.

INT. HALLWAY - ALEXANDRIA HOTEL - CLOSE SHOT - MAHOGANY
DOOR OF SUITE 12-C
Spade enters scene, touches buzzer. The door is
immediately opened by an undersized youth. The youth says
nothing, stands aside for Spade to enter. CAMERA FOLLOWS
Spade through the door into --

INT. LIVING ROOM
A flabbily fat man struggles breathlessly to raise up out
of a plush armchair, finally succeeds. He has bulbous pink
cheeks and lips and chins and neck, with a great soft egg
of a belly that is all his torso, and pendant cones for
arms and legs.
As he advances to meet Spade, all his bulbs rise and shake
and fall separately with each step. His eyes, made small
by fat puffs around them, are dark and lustrous. Dark
ringlets thinly cover his broad scalp. He wears a black
cutaway coat, black vest, black satin Ascot tie holding a
tear-shaped pearl, striped gray worsted trousers, and
patent-leather shoes. His voice is a throaty purr.
GUTMAN
Ah, Mr. Spade.
He extends a hand that is like a fat pink star.
takes the hand, smiles.

Spade

SPADE
How do you do, Mr. Gutman.
Holding Spade's hand, the fat man turns, puts his other
hand to Spade's elbow, guides him across the rug to the
plush armchair beside which is a table that holds a siphon,
glasses, a bottle of Scotch whiskey and a box of cigars.
Spade sits down. The fat man begins to fill two glasses
from bottle and siphon. The boy opens the door to an
adjacent bedroom, withdraws. Gutman proffers Spade one
of the glasses.
GUTMAN
(purring)
We begin well, sir. I distrust a
man that says "when". If he's got
to be careful not to drink too much,
it's because he's not to be trusted
when he does.
Spade takes the glass, smiling. The fat man raises his
glass, holds it against the window's light, nods
approvingly.

GUTMAN
Well, sir, here's to plain speaking
and clear understanding.
(he regards Spade shrewdly)
You're a close-mouthed man?
SPADE
(shakes his head)
I like to talk.
GUTMAN
(exclaims delightedly)
Better and better. I distrust a
close-mouthed man. He generally
picks the wrong time to talk and
says the wrong things. Talking's
something you can't do judiciously
unless you keep in practice.
He picks up the box of cigars, holds it out to Spade.
Spade takes one, trims the end of it, lights it. The fat
man pulls another plush armchair around to face Spade's,
takes a cigar from the box, lowers himself into the chair.
His bulbs stop jouncing and settle into flabby rest.
Gutman smiles comfortably.
GUTMAN
Now, sir, we'll talk if you like,
and I'll tell you right out that
I'm a man who likes talking to a
man that likes to talk.
SPADE
Swell... Will we talk about the
black bird?
Gutman's bulbs ride up and down on his laughter.
face is shiny with delight.

His pink

GUTMAN
You're the man for me, sir. No
beating about the bush but right to
the point. Let us talk about the
black bird by all means... But first,
sir, answer me a question. Are you
here as Miss O'Shaughnessy's
representative?
Spade frowns thoughtfully at the ash-tipped end of his
cigar.
SPADE
There is nothing certain about it
either way yet... It depends.

GUTMAN
It depends on? -Spade blows a slanting plume of smoke over the fat man's
head, says nothing.
GUTMAN
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo?
SPADE
(noncommittally)
Maybe.
GUTMAN
(purrs ingratiatingly)
The question is, then, which you'll
represent... It will be one or the
other.
SPADE
I didn't say so.
GUTMAN
(voice sinking to
a throaty whisper)
Who else is there?
SPADE
(pointing his cigar
at his chest)
There's me.
The fat man sinks back into his chair, blows his breath out
in a long contented gust.
GUTMAN
That's wonderful, sir, wonderful!
I do like a man that tells you right
out he's looking out for himself.
Don't we all? I don't trust a man
that says he's not.
SPADE
(exhales smoke)
Uh-huh. Now let's talk about the
black bird.
GUTMAN

Let's.

his eyes are but
two dark gleams)

Mr. Spade, have you any conception
of how much money can be got for

Well, sir, if I told you -- if I
told you half -- you'd call me a liar.
SPADE
(smiles)
No -- not even if I thought so.
But you just tell me what it is
and I'll figure out the profits.
Gutman's bulbs jostle one another as he laughs again.
he stops laughing abruptly, stares at Spade with an
intentness that suggests myopia.
GUTMAN
(sibilantly)
You mean you don't know what the
bird is?
Spade makes a careless gesture with his cigar.
SPADE
I know what it's supposed to look
like. I know the value in human
life you people put on it...
GUTMAN
(in amazement)
She didn't tell you what it is?
And Cairo didn't either?
SPADE
He offered me ten thousand for it.
GUTMAN
(scornfully)
Ten thousand -- and dollars, mind
you, not even pounds.
(he grunts in disgust)
Humph!

Then

GUTMAN (CONT'D)
(rests the glass
on his belly.
Then half aloud:)
They must know what it is -- must
-- but do they?
(clears his throat,
then in his former
voice)
Do they know what the bird is, sir?
What is your impression?
SPADE
(shakes his head)
There's not much to go by. Cairo
didn't say he did, and he didn't
say he didn't... She said she
didn't but I took it for granted
she was lying.
GUTMAN
That was not an injudicious thing
to do.
(he shuts his eyes,
opens them suddenly
wide, cries:)
If they don't know, I'm the only one
in the whole, wide, sweet world who
does!
SPADE
Swell! When you've told me, that
will make two of us.
Gutman cocks his head at Spade -- eyes a-twinkle.
GUTMAN
Mathematically correct, sir -- but
I don't know for certain that I'm
going to tell you.
SPADE
(grins indulgently)
Don't be foolish. You know what
it is. I know where it is. That's
why I'm here.
GUTMAN
Well, sir, where is it?
Spade ignores the question. The fat man bunches his lips,
raises his eyebrows, cocks his head even further.

GUTMAN
(blandly)
You see? I must tell you what I
know but you will not tell me what
you know. That is hardly equitable,
sir. No, no. I don't think we can
do business along those lines.
Spade's face becomes hard.

He gets slowly to his feet.

SPADE
(voice low, furious)
Think again and think fast. I told
that gunman of yours that you'd have
to talk to me before you got through.
I'll tell you now that you'll do your
talking today or you are through.
What are you wasting your time for?
I can get along without you.
He tosses his glass at the table. The glass strikes the
wood, breaks apart, splattering its contents and glittering
fragments over table and floor. Spade wheels to confront
Gutman again. The fat man pays no more attention to the
glass's fate than does Spade. Lips pursed, eyebrows
raised, head cocked, he has maintained his pink-faced
blandness throughout Spade's angry speech -- and he
continues to maintain it.
SPADE
Another thing. I don't want...
The door at Spade's left opens and the boy comes in, shuts
the door, stands in front of it, hands flat against his
flanks. His gaze runs over Spade's body from shoulders to
knees, then up again to settle on the knot in Spade's tie.
SPADE
(glaring at the
boy -- repeats)
Another thing. Keep that gunsel
away from me while you're making
up your mind. I'll kill him.
The boy's lips twitch in a shadowy smile.
raises his eyes nor speaks.

He neither

GUTMAN
Well, sir, I must say you've a most
violent temper.
Spade crosses to the chair in which he dropped his hat,
picks it up and sets it on his head.

SPADE
Think it over! You've got till
five-thirty. Then you're either
in or out for keeps.
He lets his arm drop, scowls at the bland fat man, scowls
at the boy, goes to the door through which he had entered,
opens it. He goes out, slamming the door.

INT. HALL - ALEXANDRIA
CAMERA TROLLIES down the hall ahead of Spade. He puts two
blunt fingers inside his collar, pulls it away from his
throat. He licks his lips as though they were dry. Then
he takes out his handkerchief, wipes his face.
Reaching the elevator, he presses the button, then raises
his hand, looks at it. The hand is trembling. Spade
grins. The elevator door opens. Spade enters. As the
door is closing another elevator door opens and Cairo steps
out. Neither man sees the other.

INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT - BRYAN, SPADE,
AN ASSISTANT D.A., AND A STENOGRAPHER
Bryan's dark walnut desk is handsomely outfitted with
bronze clock, inkwell, blotter, and a small vase of
flowers. He is a blonde man of medium stature, perhaps
forty-five years old. His eyes peer aggressively thru
black ribboned nose glasses. He has the over-large mouth
of an orator and a wide, dimpled chin. Spade sits in a
leather easy chair to the left and a few feet away from the
desk. The assistant D.A., in a straight-back chair, faces
Bryan across the desk. The stenographer, also in a
straight-back chair, is about ten feet away.
BRYAN
(to Spade -- his
voice resonant
with latent power)
Who killed Thursby?
SPADE
I don't know.
The D.A. rubs his black eyeglass ribbon between thumb and
fingers.
BRYAN
(knowingly)
Perhaps you don't but you could
make an excellent guess.

SPADE
(serenely)
My guess might be excellent or it
might be crummy but Mrs. Spade didn't
raise any children dippy enough to
make guesses in front of a district
attorney and a stenographer.
BRYAN
Why shouldn't you if you've nothing

Everybody has something to conceal.
BRYAN
And you have? -SPADE

The D.A. looks down at his desk, then up at Spade.

BRYAN
If you prefer not having the
stenographer here, we can dismiss
him. It was simply a matter of
convenience that I brought him in.
SPADE
I don't mind him a bit. I'm willing
to have anything I say put down and
I'm willing to sign it.
BRYAN
(reassuringly)
We don't intend asking you to sign
anything. I wish you wouldn't
regard this as a formal inquiry at
all. And please don't think I have
any belief in those theories the
police seem to have formed.
SPADE
(feels in his pockets
for tobacco and papers)
I'm glad of that. What's your theory?
Bryan leans forward in his chair, his eyes are hard and
shiny as the lenses over them.

BRYAN
Tell me who Archer was shadowing
Thursby for and I'll tell you who
killed Thursby.
Spade laughs briefly.
BRYAN
Don't misunderstand me, Spade.
(he knocks on
the desk with
his knuckles)
I don't say your client killed
Thursby or had him killed but I do
say, knowing who your client is, or
was, I'll mighty soon know who
killed Thursby.
SPADE
That's where you're mistaken.
BRYAN
Whether or not I'm mistaken isn't
for you to judge.
SPADE
(interrupting)
I thought this was an informal talk.
BRYAN
(sits up straight and
squares shoulders)
I am a sworn officer of the law
twenty- four hours a day and neither
formality or informality justifies
your withholding from me evidence of
a crime except, of course -(he nods meaningly)
-- on constitutional grounds.
SPADE
You mean if it might incriminate me?
Oh, I've got grounds that suit me
better. My clients are entitled to
a decent amount of secrecy.

forward, leans
over the desk,
his weight on
his knuckles)

SPADE (CONT'D)
Both you and the police have as much
as accused me of being mixed up in
the other night's murders. Well,
I've had trouble with both of you
before. As far as I can see, my
best chance of clearing myself of
the trouble you are trying to make
for me is by bringing in the
murderers all tied up, and my only
chance of ever catching them and
tying them up and bringing them in
is by keeping away from you and the
police because you'd only gum up the
works.
(turns his head
over his shoulder
to address the
stenographer)
Getting this all right, son, or am
I going too fast for you?
STENOGRAPHER
(looks up at Spade
with startled eyes)
No, sir, I'm getting it all right.
SPADE
Good work.
(turning to Bryan again)
Now, if you want to go to the board
and tell them I'm obstructing justice
and ask them to revoke my license,
hop to it. You've tried it before
and it didn't get you anything but
a good laugh all around.
(he picks up his hat)
BRYAN
(half rises)
But, look here...
SPADE
And I don't want any more of those
informal talks. I've got nothing
to tell you or the police and I'm
tired of being called things by
every crackpot on the city payroll.
If you want to see me, pinch me or
subpoena me or something and I'll
come down with my lawyer...

He stalks out.

EXT. SPADE'S OFFICE BUILDING
Spade enters scene, starts to go in, comes face to face
with the undersized youth who puts himself directly in
Spade's path.
BOY
Come on... He wants to see you.
The youth's hands are in his overcoat pockets. His pockets
bulge more than his hands need make them bulge.
SPADE
(grinning)
I didn't expect you until five
twenty-five. I hope I haven't
kept you waiting.
The youth raises his eyes to Spade's mouth.
BOY
(in a strained
voice of one in
physical pain)
Keep on riding me and they'll be
picking iron out of your liver!
SPADE
(chuckles)
The cheaper the crook, the gaudier
the patter... Well, let's go.
PAN with them as they start up the street side by side.
The boy's hands remain in his overcoat pockets.
WIPE TO:

INT. GUTMAN'S FLOOR - THE ALEXANDRIA - MED. SHOT ON
ELEVATOR DOOR
As it opens, Spade and the boy step out. CAMERA TROLLIES
AHEAD of them as they come up the hall. Spade lags behind
a little as they approach Suite 12-C. When they are within
fifteen feet of the door, he leans sideways suddenly and
grasps the boy from behind by both arms just beneath the
boy's elbows. The boy struggles and squirms but he is
impotent in the big man's grip. The boy kicks back his
feet but they go between Spade's spread legs. Spade lifts
the boy up from the floor, brings him down hard on his feet
again.

At the moment of impact, Spade's hands slide down, get a
fresh grip on the boy's hands in his overcoat pockets. The
two are tense and motionless for a long moment. Then the
boy's arms become limp. Spade releases him and steps back.
In each of Spade's hands, when they come out of the
overcoat pockets, there is a heavy automatic pistol. Spade
puts the pistols in his own pockets.
SPADE
(grinning derisively)
Come on. This will put you in solid
with your boss.
They go to the door of 12-C. Spade presses the buzzer.
The boy keeps his hands in his overcoat pockets. Gutman
opens the door. A glad smile lights his fat face. He
holds out a hand.
GUTMAN
Ah, come in, sir! Thank you for
coming. Come in.
Spade shakes the hand, enters.

The boy goes in behind him.

INT. GUTMAN'S LIVING ROOM
As the fat man shuts the door, Spade takes the boy's
pistols from his pocket, holds them out toward Gutman.
SPADE
Here... You shouldn't let him go around
with these. He'll get himself hurt.
The fat man laughs merrily, takes the pistols.
GUTMAN
Well -- well! What's this?
(he looks from
Spade to the boy)
SPADE
A crippled newsie took them away
from him but I made him give them
back.
The boy takes the pistols out of Gutman's hands, pockets
them. He does not speak.
GUTMAN
(after another
merry laugh)
By gad, Sir, you're a chap worth
knowing. An amazing character!
Give me your hat... Sit down.

As before, the boy withdraws into the adjoining bedroom,
and, as before, the fat man leads Spade to the green
plush chair by the table.
GUTMAN
(mixing whiskey
and soda)
I owe you an apology, sir, for -SPADE
Never mind that! Let's talk about
the black bird.
The fat man cocks his head to the left, regards Spade with
fawned eyes.
GUTMAN
All right, sir, let's.
He puts a glass in Spade's hand, points to the open box
of cigars, sits.
GUTMAN
(repeats)
Let's.
(he leans his
weight forward
in the chair)
This is going to be the most
astounding thing you ever heard of,
sir, and I say that knowing that a
man of your caliber, in your
profession, must have known some
astounding things in his time.
Spade nods politely.

The fat man screws up his eyes.

GUTMAN
What do you know, sir, about the
Order of the hospital of St. John
of Jerusalem, later called the
Knights of Rhodes and other things?
SPADE
(lights a cigar)
Crusaders or something, weren't they?
GUTMAN
(approvingly)
Very good... In 1539 these Crusading
Knights persuaded the Emperor Charles
V to give them the Island of Malta.
(MORE)

GUTMAN (CONT'D)
He made but one condition. They were
to pay him, each year, the tribute
of a falcon in acknowledgment that
Malta was still under Spain. Do you
follow me?
Spade grunts. The fat man looks over his shoulder at the
three closed doors, then lowers his voice to a husky
whisper.
GUTMAN
Have you any conception of the
extreme, the immeasurable wealth of
the Order at that time?
SPADE
I imagine they were pretty well fixed.
GUTMAN
(smiles indulgently)
Pretty well is -- is putting it mildly.
(his whisper becomes
lower and more purry)
They were rolling in wealth, sir.
For years they had taken from the
East, nobody knows what spoils of
gems, precious metals, silks,
ivories, sir. We all know that the
Holy Wars to them were largely a
matter of loot...
Spade nods.
GUTMAN
...The Knights were profoundly
grateful to the Emperor Charles for
his generosity toward them. They
hit upon the happy thought of
sending him for the first year's
tribute not an insignificant live
bird but a glorious golden falcon
encrusted from head to feet with the
finest jewels in their coffers.
(he leans his
weight back in
his chair, takes
a sip out of his
glass, then rests
it on his belly)
Well, sir, what do you think of that?

SPADE
(shrugs slightly)
I don't know.
GUTMAN
(complacently)
Those are facts, historical facts,
not school book history, not Mr.
Wells' history, but history
nevertheless.
Spade nods again, drinks.
GUTMAN
They sent this foot-high jeweled
bird to Charles, who was then in
Spain. They sent it in a galley
commanded by a member of the Order.
(his voice sinks
to a whisper again)
It never reached Spain. A famous
admiral of buccaneers took the
Knight's galley and the bird. In
1713 it turned up in Sicily. In
1840 it appeared in Paris. It had,
by that time, acquired a coat of
black enamel so that it looked like
nothing more than a fairly
interesting black statuette. In
that disguise, sir, it was, you
might say, kicked around Paris for
more than three score years by
private owners too stupid to see
what it was under the skin... Then
in 1923 a Greek dealer named
Charilaos Konstantinides found it in
an obscure shop.
(he chuckles)
No thickness of enamel could conceal
value from his eyes.
The fat man raises his glass, smiles at it emptiness,
rises to fill it and Spade's.
GUTMAN
(working the siphon)
You begin to believe me a little?
SPADE
I haven't said I didn't.
The fat man sits down again, drinks generously, pats his
mouth with a white handkerchief.

GUTMAN
Well, sir, to hold it safe while
pursuing his researches into its
history, Charilaos re-enameled the
bird. Despite that precaution,
however, I got wind of his find.
(he sighs deeply)
Ah, sir, if I had only known a few
days sooner. I was in London when I
heard. I packed a bag and took the
boat train immediately. On the
train I opened a paper, the Times,
and read that Charilaos'
establishment had been burglarized
and him murdered. Sure enough, upon
arriving there, I discovered that
the bird was gone.
(he shakes his
head sadly -then he shuts
his eyes, smiles
complacently at
inner thoughts)
That was seventeen years ago. Well,
sir, it took me seventeen years to
locate that bird -- but I did.
(he opens his
eyes suddenly)
I wanted it and I'm not a man that's
easily discouraged when I want
something.
(his smile grows
broad -- he
drains his glass,
dries his lips,
returns his
handkerchief to
his pocket)
I traced it to the home of a Russian
general -- one Kemidov -- in an
Istanbul suburb. He didn't know a
thing about it. It was nothing but
a black enameled figure to him, but
his natural contrariness kept him
from selling it to me when I made
him an offer. So I sent some -- ah
-- agents to get it. Well, sir,
they got it and I haven't got it.
(he stands up again,
carries his empty
glass to the table)
But I'm going to get it... Your
glass, sir.

SPADE
Then the bird doesn't belong to any
of you but to a General Kemidov?
GUTMAN
(filling Spade's glass)
Well, sir, you might say it belonged
to the King of Spain but I don't see
how you can honestly grant anybody
else clear title to it -- except by
right of possession.
(he leans forward,
puts his hand on
Spade's knee)
Well, now, before we start to talk
prices, how soon can you -- or how
soon are you willing to produce the
Falcon?
SPADE
A couple of days.
GUTMAN
(nods)
That is satisfactory.
(he holds up his glass)
Well, sir, here's to a fair bargain
and profits large enough for both
of us.
They both drink.
SPADE
What's your idea of a fair bargain.
GUTMAN
I'll give you twenty-five thousand
dollars when you deliver the Falcon
to me and another twenty-five
thousand later on. Or, I'll give
you one quarter of what I realize on
the Falcon. That would amount to a
vastly greater sum.
SPADE
How much greater?
GUTMAN
Who knows? Shall I say one hundred
thousand? Will you believe me if
I name the sum that seems the
probable minimum?

SPADE
Why not?
GUTMAN
(lowers his voice
to a purring murmur)
What would you say to quarter of a
million?
SPADE
(narrowing his eyes)
Then you think the dingus is worth
a million?
GUTMAN
(serenely)
In your own words, why not?
Spade empties his glass, sets it on the table, puts his
cigar in his mouth, takes it out, looks at it distastefully,
lays it on the ash tray.
SPADE
That's a lot of dough.
GUTMAN
A lot of dough.
SPADE
The minimum, huh?

And the maximum?

There is an unmistakable "sh" following the "x" in maximum
as Spade says it. The fat man leans forward, pats Spade's
knee.
GUTMAN
The maximum I refuse to guess.
You'd think me crazy. I don't know.
There's no telling how high it could
go, sir, and that's the one and only
truth about it.
Spade pulls his lower lip tight against the upper, shakes
his head, raises his right hand, presses his palm against
the base of his head. Then he stands up helping himself
with his hands on the arms of his chair.
He shakes his head again, takes an uncertain step forward.
Gutman jumps up, pushes back his chair. His fat globes
jiggle. His eyes are dark holes in an oily face. Spade
swings his head from side to side until his dull eyes are
pointed to the door. He takes another uncertain step.

GUTMAN
(calls sharply)
Wilmer!
The door to the bedroom opens and the boy comes in.
Through the door we see a row of cases and bags closed and
ready for traveling on the floor. Spade takes a third
step. His jaw muscles stand out like tumors under his
ears. His legs do not straighten again after his fourth
step and his dull eyes are all but covered by their lids.
He takes a fifth step.
The boy comes over, stands close to Spade, hands inside his
coat over his heart. The corners of his mouth twitch.
Spade essays a sixth step. The boy's leg darts out in
front of Spade's leg. Spade trips and crashes, face
downward, on the floor. The boy, keeping his right hand
under his coat, looks down at Spade. Spade tries to get
up. The boy draws his right foot far back, kicks Spade's
temple.
The kick rolls Spade over on his side. Once more he tries
to get up -- cannot -- goes to sleep. Joel Cairo appears
in the bedroom door, hat in hand, looks down at Spade as

The room is in complete darkness save for a pale rectangle
that is the window... There is the SOUND of a groan,
followed by low mumbling. After a short silence, the groan
is repeated, then the sound of scuffling.
A form rises, stands in silhouette against the rectangle.
Staggering slightly, the form moves away from CAMERA toward
the window. En route it knocks over a piece of furniture.
It reaches the window, opens it, drinks in air with gasps
that are like sobs. Then it leaves the window,
disappearing into darkness.
The lights come on and we see Spade standing, one hand on
the switch, the other to his head where neck and skull
join. His right temple is dark and swollen. He turns away
from the switch to look with dazed, heavy- lidded eyes
around the room. It is exactly as it was when he lost
consciousness except for an over-turned side table and the
door to a closet being open. The closet is empty. Spade
walks unsteadily into the bedroom.

lavatory, turns on the water, splashes it over his face,
groans again, makes a cup of his hands, fills the cup with
water, drinks, or rather, takes the water into his mouth
and spits it out. He does not use a towel, turns back into
the bedroom, leaving the water tap running.
In a fumbling, but completely methodical way, he starts
searching the room. He takes the covers off the twin beds,
turns the mattresses over, pulls the beds away from the

chairs, turns the chairs over to look at the undersides.

Effie shakes her head violently.

We changed cabs twice like you told

Then she didn't show up because
she didn't want to.
Effie opens her mouth to say something, closes it again as
she sees the bruise on Spade's temple.
Oh!

EFFIE
Your head! What happened!

He barely touches his temple with his fingers, flinches,
turns his grimace into a grim smile.
SPADE
I wouldn't know. I went visiting

SPADE
It's not as bad as it looks.

Did what happened this afternoon

Something.
Spade takes his hat away from her, makes a harsh noise in
his throat, goes to the corridor door.

He takes a newspaper out of the basket. It is folded with

says something to the policeman, which we do not hear, then
he takes out his wallet, opens it, shows it to the
policeman. The policeman lets him pass. CAMERA PANS with
Spade as he goes to a group of men.

Anybody burnt?
AD LIBS
Nope...
Nobody...
Only the harbor watch was aboard...
Spade draws the mate aside.
SPADE
Someone I know came aboard this
afternoon. I haven't heard from
her since. I'm worried.
MATE
No reason to be, Mister... Everybody
got off all right.
SPADE
I wonder if you saw her. She was
about five feet five with red hair...

MATE
(shaking his head)
Couldn't tell you, Mister, but if
she came aboard, she got off all
right. Only the harbor watch was
aboard when the fire started.

INT. SPADE'S PRIVATE OFFICE - SPADE AND EFFIE PERINE
Spade leans back in his chair talking with his eyes closed.
Effie, sitting on the desk, is bathing his temple with a
wet handkerchief. Her face is flushed with excitement and
her eyes brilliant.
SPADE
And now you know as much about it
as I do, Precious. Maybe they
went down to the ship -- maybe
not...
EFFIE
The part about the bird -- is
thrilling.
SPADE
Yes -- or ridiculous.
OVER SCENE the SOUND of the corridor door opening and
closing. Spade sits up straight in his chair, waiting,
listening. Effie gets down from the desk, starts toward
the connecting door but before she can reach it:
SPADE
Hold on...
She stops in the middle of the floor, turns her head to
look at Spade. He gets up, goes to the door, opens it.

ANGLE ON CONNECTING DOOR
A tall, thin man in a black overcoat buttoned from throat
to knees, takes two steps forward. Held tight against his
left side he holds a paper-wrapped parcel bound with thin
rope -- an ellipsoid, somewhat larger than a football.
CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD TO:

CLOSE SHOT - THE MAN
His bony face, weather coarsened, is the color of wet sand
and his eyes are dark and bloodshot and mad. There is
nothing in them to show that he sees Spade.

MAN
You know...
A bubbling sound starts in his throat, chokes his words.
He puts his right hand over the hand holding the
ellipssoid, then falls. He does not put his hands out to
break the fall -- he falls as a tree falls.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - SPADE, MAN, EFFIE
Spade catches him. The paper-wrapped parcel drops from the
man's hands, rolls across the floor. In Spade's arms the
man's body becomes limber. Spade lowers him to the floor.
The man's eyes, dark and bloodshot, are mad no longer, but
wide open and still.
SPADE
(to Effie)
Lock the door.
Effie, her teeth chattering, moves to obey. Spade kneels
beside the thin man, turns him over on his back, runs a
hand down inside his overcoat. When he withdraws the hand,
it is smeared darkly. The sight of his bloody hand brings
not the least nor briefest of changes to Spade's face.
Holding the hand up so that it will not touch anything, he
takes out his lighter with his other hand, snaps on the
flame and holds it close to first one, then the other of
the man's eyes.

CLOSEUP - MAN'S FACE
Lids, eyeballs, irises and pupils remain frozen immobile.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP
Spade extinguishes the flame, returns the lighter to his
pocket. Spade, moving on his knees around to the dead
man's side, uses his clean hand to unbutton and open the
overcoat. The jagged lapels where they cross over the
man's chest, are pierced by soggy, ragged holes -- Spade
draws a large wallet from the inside jacket pocket -- it
too is soggy. Spade opens the wallet -- takes out papers
-- looks at them -- then places wallet and paper on the
floor beside the body.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO:

MED. FULL SHOT - OFFICE
as Spade rises, goes behind the partition in the corner of
the office. OVER SCENE the SOUND of running water. Effie
Perine, wan, teeth chattering, walks around the body on the
floor back into the private office, goes to the partition.

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AND EFFIE
He is washing his hands.
EFFIE
Is -- is -- he? -SPADE
Yes... He couldn't have come far
with those in him.
(he rinses his hands,
picks up a towel)
Why couldn't he have stayed alive
long enough to say something?
(he turns to face
Effie, who is swaying
on her feet)
Pull yourself together.
(he throws down
the towel, takes
her by the elbows
tightly)
You mustn't go to pieces on me now.
Effie's eyelids flutter, she takes two deep breaths, then
she opens her eyes, nods.
EFFIE
All right, Sam.
Releasing one elbow, he turns around.

MED. FULL SHOT - OFFICE
as they come out from behind the partition. Spade goes
over to the desk beside one leg of which the paper-wrapped
parcel lies. He bends over, picks it up. When he feels
its weight, his eyes glow. He puts it on the desk, turns
it over so the knotted part of the rope is uppermost, takes
out his pocket knife and cuts the knot. Effie comes to the
corner of the desk, watches him pull the rope loose and
push aside the brown paper. Excitement begins to supplant
terror and nausea in her face.
EFFIE
(whispers)
Do you think it's...
SPADE
(putting wrapping paper
out of the way)
We'll soon know.

His fingers tear apart an egg-shaped mass of excelsior to
reveal the foot-high figure of a bird. He holds the bird
out at arm's length.
CAMERA MOVES UP TO:

CLOSEUP - THE MALTESE FALCON
in Spade's hand.

It is shiny and black as coal.

SPADE'S VOICE
(over scene)
We've got it, Angel! We've got it!

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AND EFFIE
Laughing, he puts his arm around Effie, crushing her
body against his.
EFFIE
(whispers)
You're hurting me!
He takes his arm away from her, holds the bird in both
hands, blows on it to dislodge clinging excelsior and dust,
then places it on the desk, takes a step back and regards
it triumphantly. Effie makes a horrified face, screams,
points at his feet.

CLOSEUP - SPADE'S FEET
His left heel is on the dead man's hand. Spade jerks his
foot away from the hand. OVER SCENE the SOUND of the
telephone ringing.

TWO SHOT - SPADE AND EFFIE
Spade nods at Effie.

She turns to the desk, puts the

Hello... Yes... Who?... Oh, yes...

Where?... Yes, yes... Hold the

wide and fearful

Hello... Hello... Hello...

She rattles the prong up and down, then she sobs and spins
around to face Spade, who is close beside her now.
EFFIE
(wildly)
It was Miss O'Shaughnessy! She
wants you! She's in danger!
SPADE
Where is she?
EFFIE
Burlingame -- 26 Ancho -- Oh,
Sam!... Her voice -- it was awful!
And something happened to her before
she could finish. Go help her, Sam.
Spade picks up the Falcon from the desk, turns it around,
scowls gloomily at the thin corpse on the floor, points
his thumb at it.
SPADE
I've got to take care of this fellow
first.
Effie comes around in front of him, starts beating his
chest with her fists.
EFFIE
(crying)
No, No!... You've got to go to her.
Don't you see, Sam!
(her wide terrified
eyes behold the
dead man briefly)
He was helping her and they killed
him -- and now she's -- Oh, you've
got to go!
SPADE
(after a moment)
All right.
He pushes her away, bends over his desk putting the black
bird into its nest of excelsior, picks up the wrapping
paper from the floor and, working rapidly, makes a large
clumsy package.

SPADE
As soon as I've gone, phone the
police. Tell them how it happened
but don't drag any names in. You
don't know... I got the phone call
and I told you I had to go but I
didn't say where.
He untangles the rope and starts binding the package.
SPADE
Forget this thing. Tell it as it
happened but forget I had a bundle.
Get it straight now. Everything
happened the way it did happen but
without this dingus and I got the
phone call, not you.
He puts on his hat, picks up the bundle.
EFFIE
Yes, Sam... Who -- do you know who
he is?
SPADE
He was Captain Jacoby, Master of
the La Paloma.
EFFIE
(imploringly)
Hurry, Sam.
SPADE
(slowly as though
his thoughts were
elsewhere)
Sure -- I'll hurry. Might not hurt
to get these few scraps of excelsior
off the floor before the police come,
and keep the door locked.
(puts his hand
on her cheek)
You're a good man, sister.
He smiles at her and goes, the bundle under his arm.
WIPE TO:

INT. HALLWAY - OFFICE BUILDING
As Spade comes out of his office CAMERA TROLLIES ahead of
him down the hall toward the stairs. At intervals of three
or four feet, dark spots about the size of a penny show on
the white tile flooring. He turns into the service stairway.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ALLEY-WAY - NIGHT

INT. BUS TERMINAL - MED. SHOT - BAGGAGE COUNTER
A loud speaker is announcing the departure of a bus:
ANNOUNCER
All aboard for Burlingame, San
Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto...
Spade enters scene, puts his parcel on the counter. The
baggage clerk hangs the check on the parcel, tears off the
stub, gives it to Spade. He takes an envelope and pencil
out of his pocket, puts the check inside the envelope,
seals it, then bending over the counter, addresses it.

street.

EXT. UNION SQUARE - NIGHT
CAMERA TROLLIES with Spade as he walks quickly along the
line of cars for hire. He goes up to a group of hack
drivers, taps one of them on the arm.
SPADE
Hello, Frank.

FRANK
Oh, hello Mr. Spade.
They turn away from the group.
SPADE
Got plenty of gas?
FRANK
Sure thing.
CAMERA DOLLIES WITH them to a dark sedan parked at the
curb. Spade gets into the front seat. Frank runs around
the car, climbs in behind the wheel.

INT. CAR - CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AND FRANK (PROCESS)
SPADE

FRANK
(nosing out into

Nope -- but if she's there, we can
find her.
SPADE
Twenty-six is the number we want
and the sooner, the better.
FRANK
Correct.
They drive a little way in silence, then:
FRANK
Your partner got knocked off,
didn't he, Mr. Spade?
SPADE
Uh-huh.
FRANK
(shakes his head)
She's a tough racket! You can
have it for mine.
SPADE
Well, hack drivers don't live

LONG SHOT - STREET - NIGHT
The dark limousine pulls over to the curb. Spade gets out,
walks along the pavement looking at the house numbers. He
passes 32, 30, and 28. Next to 28 is a vacant lot with a
"For Sale" sign showing in the weeds. Spade takes a few
steps into the lot, then stands muttering to himself.
Presently he turns back, crosses the pavement, steps off
the curb, holds up his arm, whistles.
OVER SCENE the SOUND of a motor starting. Headlights flash
on silhouetting Spade, the car moves forward to where Spade
stands. Spade gets in beside the driver.

INT. CAR - CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AND FRANK
Frank looks at him questioningly. Spade says nothing. All
the V's in his face are accentuated. The corners of his
mouth turn up but he is not smiling.
FRANK
(eyes on the vacant lot)
Bum steer, Mr. Spade?
Spade makes no immediate reply. When he does speak, it is
not to answer the driver's question.
SPADE
Stop when you see a drug store
that's open.

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE - IN TELEPHONE BOOTH
He has the receiver to his ear.

SPADE
Hello, Mrs. Perine?... Is Effie

Hello, Precious! What's the good
word?... No, I ran into a plant.
Are you sure it was her voice?
(he makes an
unpleasant face
at her answer)
Well, it was hooey... Everything go
okay?... Nothing said about the
bundle?... Swell... Did they
take you down to the Hall?...
Uh-huh... all right, Precious, you
better hit the hay. You sound all
in... Get a good night's rest.

in the receiver.
Spade interrupts)
Save it till tomorrow. Bye.

EXT. SPADE'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
The dark limousine enters picture, pulls up to the curb.
Spade gets out.
SPADE
(to driver)
Thanks. Night, Frank.
FRANK
Goodnight, Mr. Spade.
Spade climbs the steps to the street-door. The car moves
out of scene. Spade puts his key in the lock. OVER SCENE
the SOUND of heels clicking rapidly on the sidewalk. He
releases the key and wheels. Brigid O'Shaughnessy runs up
the steps, puts her arms around him, clings to him.

Oh!

BRIGID
(panting)
I thought you'd never come!

Her face is haggard, distraught. Tremors shake her from
head to foot. With the hand not supporting her, Spade
feels for the key again, opens the door, half carries her
inside. CAMERA TROLLIES BEHIND them into the vestibule...

INT. VESTIBULE
SPADE
You've been waiting?
BRIGID
(gasps painfully)
Yes... In a -- doorway -- up the
street...
They walk to the elevator, Spade supporting her.

INT. AUTOMATIC ELEVATOR - SPADE AND BRIGID
Spade touches the button with his free hand.
SPADE
Can you make it all right or shall
I carry you?
BRIGID
(her head against
his shoulder)
I'll be -- all right -- when I -get where -- I can -- lie down.
He opens the elevator door, helps her out.

INT. SPADE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY
As Spade and Brigid are about to enter the living room, the
living room light goes on. Brigid cries out, clings to
Spade. Fat Gutman stands in the entrance to the living
room smiling benevolently at them. The boy Wilmer comes
out of the kitchen, a black pistol in either hand. The
door to the bathroom opens and Cairo appears, pointing his
flat, black automatic at Spade's feet. Spade keeps his arm
around Brigid. His look travels from one face to another.
GUTMAN
(volubly)
Well, sir, we're all here. Now
let's come in and sit down and be
comfortable and talk.
SPADE
(smiling bleakly)
Sure.
Gutman's bulbs jounce as he takes three waddling backward
steps into the living room. Spade and Brigid go in
together. Cairo stops in the doorway.

INT. SPADE'S LIVING ROOM - GROUP
The boy puts away one of his pistols, comes up behind
Spade. Spade turns his head around to look over his
shoulder at the boy.
SPADE
Get away. You're not going
to frisk me.
WILMER
Shut up!

Stand still.

SPADE
(voice level)
Put your paw on me and I'm going to
make you use that gun... Ask your
boss if he wants me shot up before
we talk.
GUTMAN
(after a pause)
Never mind, Wilmer.
(he chuckles at Spade)
You are certainly a most headstrong
individual... Well, let's be seated.
Spade takes Brigid to the sofa by the window, sits down
with her. They sit close together, her head resting
against his shoulder. She has stopped panting but she is
still trembling. Gutman lowers himself into the padded
rocking chair. Cairo chooses the armchair by the window.
The boy remains standing, one pistol huge looking in his
small hand, dangling by his side, looking under curling
lashes as Spade's body. Cairo puts his pistol on the table
beside him. Spade takes off his hat, tosses it at the
other end of the sofa, then he grins at Gutman.
SPADE
Well! Are you ready to make the
first payment and take the Falcon
off my hands?
Brigid sits up straight, looks at Spade with surprised
eyes. He pats her shoulder. His eyes remain on Gutman's.
GUTMAN
(puts his hand to his
inside breast pocket)
Well, sir, as to that...

Cairo, hands on thighs, leans forward in his chair,
breathing between parted soft lips. His eyes shift their
focus from Spade's face to Gutman's, from Gutman's to
Spade's.
GUTMAN
(repeats)
Well, sir, as to that...
He takes a white envelope from his pocket, turns it over in
his swollen hands, studies for a moment its blank white
front, then cocks his wrist, jerks his hand forward.
Spinning, the envelope sails into Spade's lap. Spade takes
his arm from around the girl. Using both hands, he opens
the envelope, takes out stiff, new bills, counts them.
SPADE
(mildly)
Ten thousand... We were talking
about more money than this.
GUTMAN
(eyes twinkling merrily)
Yes, sir, we were... But this is
genuine coin of the realm, sir.
With a dollar of this you can buy
ten dollars of talk.
(he puts a serious
expression on
his face)
There are more of us to be taken
care of now.
Spade taps the edges of the bills into alignment, returns
them to the envelope, tucking the flap in over them.
SPADE
That may be but I've got the Falcon!
CAIRO
(primly)
I shouldn't think it would be
necessary to remind you, Mr. Spade,
that though you may have the Falcon,
yet we certainly have you.
SPADE
(turning his grin
on Cairo)
I'm trying not to let that worry me.

He sits up straight, places the envelope on the arm of the
sofa, addresses Gutman.
SPADE
We'll come back to the money later.
There's another thing to be taken
care of first. We've got to have a
fall-guy.
Gutman raises his eyebrows to express inquiry.
SPADE
The police have got to have a victim
-- somebody they can stick for those
three murders.
CAIRO
(voice brittle -- excited)
Two -- only two murders, Mr. Spade.
Thursby undoubtedly killed your
partner.
SPADE
(growling)
All right, two. What difference
does it make? The point is, we've
got to give the police -GUTMAN
Come, come, Mr. Spade. You can't
expect us to believe at this late
date that you are the least bit
afraid of the police or that you
are not quite able to handle -SPADE
(in restrained tone)
I'm up to my neck, Gutman. I've got
to come through with somebody -- a
victim -- when the time comes. If I
don't I'll be it.
(his voice becomes
persuasive)
Let's give them the punk.
(he nods pleasantly
toward the boy)
He actually did shoot Thursby and
Jacoby, didn't he? Anyway, he's
made to order for the part. Let's
turn him over to them.

The boy tightens the corners of his mouth. Spade's
proposal seems to have no other effect on him. Joel
Cairo's dark face is open-eyed, amazed. Brigid moves away
from Spade, twists herself around on the sofa to stare at
him. Gutman remains still, expressionless, for a long
moment. Then he decides to laugh. He laughs heartily,
and at length.
GUTMAN
By Gad, sir, you're a character -that you are.
(takes a white
handkerchief from
his pocket and
wipes his eyes)
There's never any telling what you'll
say or do next except that it is bound
to be something astonishing.
SPADE
(in the manner of
one reasoning with
a recalcitrant friend)
It's our best bet. With him in their
hands, the police will -GUTMAN
But, my dear man, can't you see if I
even for the moment thought of doing
such a thing -- but that's
ridiculous. I feel toward Wilmer
just exactly as if he were my own
son. Really, I do. But if I even
for a moment thought of doing as you
propose, what in the world do you
think would keep Wilmer from telling
the police every last detail about
the Falcon and all of us?
SPADE
Let him talk his head off. I promise
you nobody will do anything about it.
GUTMAN
(laughs uproariously,
turns to look at the
boy)
What do you think of this, Wilmer?
It's mighty funny, eh?
The boy's eyes are cold, pale gleams under his lashes.

WILMER
(voice low, distinct)
Mighty funny...
SPADE
(to Brigid)
How do you feel now, Angel, any
better?
BRIGID
Yes, much better, only...
(she lowers her voice
to a whisper)
I'm frightened.
SPADE
(puts a hand on her knee)
Don't be. Nothing very bad's going
to happen. Want a drink?
BRIGID
(shakes her head)
Be careful, Sam.
Spade grins, looks at Gutman.
GUTMAN
(clears his throat,
laughs, then:)
Well, sir, if you're really serious
about this, the least we can do in
common politeness, is to hear you
out... Now, how would you be able
to fix it...
(laughs again)
...so that Wilmer couldn't do us
any harm?
SPADE
Bryan's like most district attorneys...
To be sure of convicting one man,
he'll let half a dozen equally guilty
accomplices go free. I can show him
that if he starts fooling around
trying to gather up everybody -he's going to have a tangled case,
while, if he sticks to Wilmer here,
he can get a conviction standing on
his head.

Walking, stiff-legged, the boy advances from the doorway
until he is in the center of the floor. He halts there,
leans forward slightly from the waist, hand and pistol
still dangle at his side but his knuckles are white over
the pistol's grip. The indelible youngness of his face
gives an indescribably vicious and inhuman turn to the
white, hot hatred and the cold white malevolence in his
face.
WILMER
(to space in a voice
cramped by passion)
Get up on your feet!
Spade smiles at the boy.
unalloyed.

His amusement seems genuine and

WILMER
I've taken all the riding from you
I'm going to take... Get up and
shoot it out.
SPADE
Young wild West!
(glances at Gutman)
Maybe you ought to tell him that
shooting me before you get your
hands on the Falcon will be bad
for business.
Gutman's voice is too hoarse and gritty for the paternally
admonishing tone he tries to achieve.
GUTMAN
Now, now Wilmer. We can't have any
of that. You shouldn't let yourself
attach such importance to these things.
WILMER
(eyes on Spade's
face as before)
Make him lay off then!
GUTMAN
Now, Wilmer...
(to Spade)
Your plan is, sir, not at all
practical, sir. Let's not say
anything more about it.

SPADE
All right -- I've got another
suggestion. It's not as good as the
first but it's better than nothing.
Want to hear it?
GUTMAN
Most assuredly.
SPADE
Give them Cairo.
Gutman tries to laugh, cannot, then:
GUTMAN
(in an uncertain tone)
Well, by Gad, sir...
CAIRO
(voice shrill with
indignation)
Suppose we give them you, Mr. Spade?
Or Miss O'Shaughnessy? How about
that?
SPADE
You people want the Falcon. I've
got it. A fall-guy is part of the
price I'm asking.
(his dispassionate gaze
moves to the girl)
If you think she can be rigged for
the part, I'm perfectly willing to
discuss it with you.
The girl puts her hands to her throat, utters a short,
strangled cry.
CAIRO
(his face and body
twitching with
excitement)
You seem to forget you are not in a
position to insist on anything!
Spade laughs -- a harsh, derisive laugh.
GUTMAN
Come now, gentlemen, let's keep our
discussion on a friendly basis. But
there certainly is...
(cocks his head at Spade)
...something in what Mr. Cairo says.

SPADE
If you kill me, how are you going to
get the bird? If I know you can't
afford to kill me, how are you going
to scare me into giving it to you?
Gutman's eyes twinkle between puckered lips.
GUTMAN
Well, sir, there are other means of
persuasion besides killing and
threatening to kill.
SPADE
Sure. But they aren't much good
unless the threat of death is behind
them. See what I mean? If you start
anything I'll make it a matter of your
having to kill me or call it off.
GUTMAN
(chuckles)
That's an attitude, sir, that calls
for the most delicate judgment on
both sides -- because, as you know,
sir, in the heat of action men are
likely to forget where their best
interests lie and let their emotions
carry them away.
SPADE
(all smiling blandness)
The trick from my angle would be to
make my play strong enough to tie you
up, yet not make you made enough to
bump me off -- against your better
judgment.
GUTMAN
(fondly)
By Gad, sir, you are a character!
Joel Cairo gets up from his chair, walks around behind the
boy to Gutman's chair, bends over, screens his mouth and
whispers into the fat man's ear. Gutman listens
attentively, nodding from time to time. Spade grins at
Brigid O'Shaughnessy, then turns to the boy.
SPADE
Two to one they're selling you
out, son.

The boy says nothing. A muscular spasm seizes the hand
that is holding the gun. Hand and gun jerk convulsively.
SPADE
(to Gutman)
I hope you're not letting yourself
be influenced by the guns these
pocket edition desperadoes are
waving...
Cairo stops whispering, makes himself erect behind the fat
man's chair.
SPADE
I've practiced taking them away from
both of them so there'll be no
trouble there. Wilmer here is...
WILMER
(furious, choked
by emotion)
All right!
He jerks his pistol up in front of his chest. Gutman
flings a fat hand out to the boy's wrist. Joel Cairo
scurries around to the boy's other side, grasps his other
arm holding onto the boy's wrist; Gutman struggles to get
his fat body out of the rocking chair, succeeds. Then he
and Cairo wrestle with the boy, forcing his arms down.
Words come out of the struggling group. Fragments of the
boy's incoherent speech: Fog... Go... Riding...
Smoke... Gutman repeats, "Now, now, Wilmer" many times and
Cairo, "No, please don't" and "You mustn't, Wilmer."
Wooden-faced, dreamy-eyed Spade gets up from the sofa, goes
over to the group. The boy, unable to cope with the weight
against him, has stopped struggling.
Spade drives his left fist against the boy's chin. The
boy's head snaps back. When it comes forward Spade drives
his right fist against the boy's chin. Cairo drops the
boy's arm letting him collapse against Gutman's round
belly. Cairo springs at Spade, clawing at his face. Tears
are in the Greek's eyes and his lips work angrily but no
sound comes from between them.
SPADE
(laughing)
Cairo, you're a pip!

He cuffs the side of Cairo's face with an open hand,
knocking him over against the table. Cairo regains his
balance, springs again. Spade stops him with a long rigid
arm, the palm flat against Cairo's face. Cairo, failing to
reach Spade, flails his shorter arms at empty air.
SPADE
(growls)
Stop it! I'll hurt you!
Cairo backs away. Spade stops to pick up Cairo's pistol
from the floor and then the boy's. He straightens up,
holding them in his left hand, dangling them upside-down,
by their trigger guards, from his fore-finger. Gutman, who
has put the boy in the rocking chair, stands looking down
at him with troubled eyes. Cairo goes down on his knees
beside the chair, begins to chafe the boy's limp hands.
Spade crosses to the chair, feels around the boy's jaw with
his fingers.
SPADE
Nothing cracked... We'll spread him
out on the sofa.
He lifts the boy without apparent effort, carries him to
the sofa. Brigid O'Shaughnessy gets up quickly. Spade
places the boy on the sofa. With his right hand he pats
the boy's clothes, finds his second pistol, adds it to the
others in his left hand, then turns his back on the sofa.
Cairo comes over and sits down beside the boy's head.
Spade clinks the pistols together in his hands, smiles
cheerfully at Gutman.
SPADE
There's our fall guy.
Gutman's eyes are clouded, troubled.
Spade but at the floor.

He does not look at

SPADE
Either you'll say yes right now or
I'll turn the Falcon and the whole
lot of you in.
Gutman's eyes dart from the floor to Spade's face.
GUTMAN
(sharply)
I don't like that, sir.

Spade rattles the guns together impatiently.
SPADE
You won't like it... Well?...
The fat man sighs, makes a wry face.
GUTMAN
(sadly)
You can have him.
SPADE
That's swell!
Cairo, sitting on the sofa, rubs the boy's temple and
wrists, smoothes his hair back from his forehead, peers
anxiously at his white, still face. Except for his
breathing, the boy's small figure is altogether corpselike. Spade puts his handful of pistols on the table,
takes a chair at a corner of the table, glances at the
tinny alarm clock atop the "Celebrated Criminal Cases".
SPADE
Two o'clock. I can't get the Falcon
till daylight or maybe later.
GUTMAN
It strikes me that it would be best
for all concerned if we did not get
out of each others sight until our
business has been transacted.
(he looks at the sofa)
...You have the envelope?
Spade shakes his head, glances over at the sofa, then
looks around at the girl.
SPADE
Miss O'Shaughnessy has it.
BRIGID
I have it.
(puts a hand inside
her jacket)
I picked it up.
Yes.

SPADE
That's all right -- hang onto it.
(to Gutman)
We won't have to lose sight of each
other. The dingus will be brought
to us here.
GUTMAN
Excellent, sir! Excellent!... Then

in exchange for the ten thousand
dollars and Wilmer, you will give
us the Falcon and an hour or two
of grace.
Spade takes out tobacco and paper, starts rolling a
cigarette.
SPADE
Let's get the details fixed. Why
did he shoot Thursby and why and
where and how did he shoot Captain
Jacoby? I've got to know all that
happened so I can be sure the parts
that won't fit are covered up.
Gutman interlaces his fingers over his belly, rocks in his
chair.
GUTMAN
(forthrightly)
I shall be candid with you, sir...
Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's
ally. We believed that disposing
of him in the manner we did would
cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stop
and think that perhaps it would
be best to patch up her differences
with us regarding the Falcon.
SPADE
You didn't try to make a deal with
him before giving him the works?
GUTMAN
(emphatically)
We did -- yes, sir. We most certainly
did. I talked to him myself that
very night but I could do nothing
with him. He was quite determinedly
loyal to Miss O'Shaughnessy... So
Wilmer followed him back to his hotel
and did what he did.
SPADE
(after a moment's thought)
That sounds all right... Now Jacoby.
GUTMAN
(gravely)
Captain Jacoby's death was entirely
Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.

Brigid gasps, puts her hand to her mouth.
SPADE
Tell me what happened.
GUTMAN
(rocking throughout)
Well, Cairo, as you must have
surmised, got in touch with me after
he left police headquarters yesterday
night -- or morning. He recognized
the mutual advantage of pooling forces.
(directs his smile
at Cairo)
Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgment.
The Paloma was his thought. He saw
the notice of its arrival in the
papers and remembered that he had
heard in Hong Kong that Jacoby and
Miss O'Shaughnessy had been seen
together. Well, sir, he saw that
notice and putting two and two
together, guessed the truth -- she
had given the bird to Jacoby to
bring here for her...
SPADE
And at that juncture you decided to
slip me the mickey, huh?
GUTMAN
(nods, then apologetically)
There was no place for you in our
plans, sir, so we decided to spare
ourselves any possible embarrassment...
Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I went to
call on Captain Jacoby. We were
lucky enough to arrive while Miss
O'Shaughnessy was there. In many
ways it was a difficult conference
but we finally persuaded Miss
O'Shaughnessy to come to terms, or
so we thought. We then left the
boat and set out for my hotel where
I was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessy and
receive the bird. Well, sir, we
mere men should have known better.
En route she and Captain Jacoby and
the Falcon slipped completely
through our fingers.
(he laughs merrily -then turns to beam
at Brigid)
It was neatly done, sir. Indeed it was!

Spade looks at the girl.
pleading, meet his.

Her eyes, large and dark with

SPADE
(to Gutman)
You touched off the boat before you
left?
GUTMAN
Not intentionally, though I dare say
we, or Wilmer at least, were
responsible for one fire. While the
rest of us were talking in the
cabin, Wilmer went about the ship
trying to find the Falcon. No doubt
he was careless with matches.
SPADE
All right... Now about the shooting.
GUTMAN
We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessy
and Jacoby at her apartment. I sent
Wilmer downstairs to cover the fire
escape before ringing the bell. And,
sure enough, while she was asking us
who we were through the door and we
told her, we heard a window go up.
Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was coming
down the fire escape -- shot him
more than once. But Jacoby was too
tough either to fall or drop the
Falcon. He climbed the rest of the
way down, knocked Wilmer over and
ran off.
(he breaks off to
smile at a memory)
We persuaded -- that is the word,
sir, we... ah... persuaded Miss
O'Shaughnessy to tell us where she
had told Captain Jacoby to take the
Falcon. And we... ah... further...
ah... persuaded her to phone your
office in an attempt to draw you
away before Jacoby got there. But,
unfortunately for us, it had taken
too long to persuade Miss
O'Shaughnessy...
The boy on the sofa groans, rolls over on his side.
eyes open and close several times.

His

GUTMAN
(concludes hurriedly)
And you had the Falcon before we
could reach you.
The boy puts one foot on the floor, raises himself on an
elbow, opens eyes wide, puts the other foot down, sits up
and looks around. When his eyes focus on Spade, bewilderment leaves them. Spade gets up from his chair to sit on
the corner of the table. The boy looks at Gutman. Gutman
smiles benignly.
GUTMAN
Well, Wilmer, I am sorry indeed to
lose you and I want you to know that
I couldn't be any fonder of you if
you were my own son. But well, by
Gad, if you lose a son, it's possible
to get another and there's only one
Maltese Falcon.
Spade laughs.

The boy's eyes remain on Gutman's face.

GUTMAN
(sighs -- then to Spade)
When you're young you simply don't
understand these things.
Spade grins at Gutman.
SPADE
(to Brigid)
How about some coffee? Put the pot
on, will you? I don't like to leave
my guests.
BRIGID
(quickly)
Surely.
She starts toward the door.
GUTMAN
(stops rocking)
Just a moment, my dear.
(holds up a
thick hand)
Hadn't you better leave the envelope
in here?
Brigid's eyes question Spade. Spade nods. She puts her
hand inside her coat, takes out the envelope, gives it to
Spade. He tosses it into Gutman's lap.

SPADE
Sit on it if you are afraid of
losing it.
GUTMAN
(suavely)
You misunderstand me. It is not
that at all but business should be
trans acted in a business-like
manner.
(he opens the
envelope, takes
out and counts
the bills, then
chuckles)
For instance, there are only nine
bills here now.
(he spreads them
on his knee)
There were ten when I handed it to
you, as you very well know.
(his smile is broad,
jovial and triumphant)
SPADE
(looks at Brigid)
Well?
She shakes her head. Her lips move slightly. Her face is
frightened. Spade holds out his hand to Gutman and the
money is put into it. Spade counts the money -- nine bills
-- and returns it to Gutman. Spade picks up the three
pistols from the table, rises.
SPADE
(matter-of-factly)
I want to know about this.
Cairo looks at Spade with questioning eyes. The boy beside
him does not look up. He is leaning forward, head between
hands, elbow between knees, staring at the floor between
his feet.
SPADE
(to Gutman)
You palmed it.
GUTMAN
(chuckles)
I palmed it?

SPADE
Yes.
(he jingles his
pistols in his pocket)
Do you want to say so or do you want
to stand for a frisk?
GUTMAN
Stand for?...
SPADE
You're going to admit it or I'm
going to search you. There's no
third way.
Gutman rocks back in his chair, laughs delightedly.
GUTMAN
By Gad, sir, I believe you would. I
really do. You are a character, sir
-- if you don't mind my saying so.
SPADE
You palmed it.
GUTMAN
Yes, sir, that I did.
He takes a crumpled bill from his vest pocket, smoothes
it on his thigh, then, opening the flap of the envelope
puts the smoothed bill in with the others.
GUTMAN
I must have my little joke now and
then. And I was curious to know what
you'd do in a situation of that sort.
I must say that you passed the test
with flying colors, sir. It never
occurred to me that you'd hit on
such a simple and direct way of
getting at the truth.
(he beams at Spade)
SPADE
(sneering)
That's the kind of thing I'd expect
from somebody Wilmer's age.
Gutman chuckles. Brigid exits into the kitchen. Gutman
offers Spade the white envelope. Spade looks at the
pistols in his hand, then at Gutman, goes into the passage
to the closet, opens the closet door, puts the pistols on
top of a trunk, shuts the door, locks it, turns back into
the living room.

GUTMAN
This will soon be yours.
as well take it.
Spade does not take it.

You might

He sits on the arm of the armchair.

SPADE
I ought to have more than ten
thousand.
GUTMAN
Of course, sir, you understand that
this is the first payment. Later...
SPADE
(laughing)
I know you'll give me millions later.
But how's about fifteen thousand now?
GUTMAN
Frankly and candidly and on my word
of honor as a gentleman, ten thousand
is all the money I can raise.
SPADE
But you didn't say positively.
GUTMAN
(laughs -- repeats)
Positively!
Spade puts out his hand. The fat man lays the envelope in
it, then screws up his eyes, moves his head to indicate the
kitchen.
GUTMAN
I'd like to give you a word of
advice.
SPADE
Go ahead.
GUTMAN
I dare say you'll give her some money
but if you don't give her as much as
she thinks she ought to have, my word
of advice is -- be careful.
SPADE
(mockingly)
Dangerous?

GUTMAN
(nods slowly)
Very.
Spade calls toward the kitchen.
SPADE
How's the coffee coming?
BRIGID'S VOICE
(over scene)
It's coming.
Gutman glances at his watch.
GUTMAN
It is six o'clock, Mr. Spade.
you start getting it now?

Can

SPADE
I guess so.
He gets up, stretches, goes to the telephone, dials a
number. Gutman stops rocking and Cairo takes the
handkerchief away from his mouth while Spade is waiting for
the number to answer. The boy lies down with his feet
toward Cairo, turns his face to the window. Brigid comes
to the door carrying a tray with coffee pot, cups, sugar,
and cream. Seeing Spade at the telephone, she stops in the
threshold, stands waiting. Spade whistles two lines of "En
Cuba" softly.
SPADE
(into phone)
Hello, Precious... Sorry to get you
up... Yes, very... Here's the plot...
In our Holland box at the Post Office
you'll find an envelope in my scrawl.
There's a bus-station parcel room
check in it for the bundle we got
yesterday... Will you get the bundle
and bring it to me P.D.Q... Yes, I'm
home... That's the girl -- hustle...
Bye.
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - SPADE'S APARTMENT
A strip of daylight shows between the drawn curtains at one
of the windows. The electric lights are still on. The
clock on the side table says ten minutes of eight. The air
in the room is thick with tobacco smoke. Gutman is in his
rocker smoking a cigar and reading from "Celebrated Cases".

The boy is fast asleep on the sofa. Cairo, at the farthest
corner of the sofa, is nodding. The girl is curled up in
the arm chair, her cheek resting against the back of the
chair. She's not asleep.
Spade sits at a corner of the table smoking and drinking
coffee. Coffee pot and dirty cups and saucers stand on the
table. He mashes the last of his cigarette in his saucer,
stretches, gets up, goes to the window, opens the curtains.
Sunlight shows on the panes. He leaves the window, goes to
the wall switch, turns off the electricity. Gutman's eyes
raise from his book now and then as Spade moves around the
room. Brigid's eyes never leave Spade.
OVER SCENE the street door bell rings. Cairo jerks to
wakefulness. Gutman puts down his book. Spade goes to the
telephone box and presses the button releasing the street
door lock. Brigid puts her legs down from the chair, sits
up.
GUTMAN
(to Spade)
You don't mind if I go to the door
with you?
Spade nods -- Gutman struggles out of his chair -- follows
Spade into corridor. CAMERA TROLLIES after them.

THE CORRIDOR DOOR
Spade opens it. OVER SCENE the SOUND of the elevator.
Presently the elevator door opens and Effie Perine comes
out carrying the brown-wrapped parcel. Her boyish face is
gay and bright. She comes forward quickly. After one
quick glance, she does not look at Gutman. Smiling, she
gives Spade the parcel.
SPADE
Thanks a lot, lady. I'm sorry to
spoil your day of rest but this...
EFFIE
(laughing)
It is not the first one you've
spoiled... Anything else?
SPADE
(shaking his head)
No thanks.
EFFIE
Bye-bye then.

She turns and goes back to the elevator. Spade shuts the
door. CAMERA TROLLIES AHEAD of Spade and Gutman as they
carry the parcel into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM
Gutman's face is dark, his cheeks quivery. Cairo and
Brigid come to the table as Spade puts the parcel there.
The boy rises, pale and tense, but he remains by the sofa
staring under curling lashes at the others.
SPADE
(stepping back from
the table)
There you are!
Gutman's fat fingers make short work of cord and paper and
excelsior.
GUTMAN
(huskily)
Now -- after seventeen years!
He takes the black bird, holds it in both hands, looks at
it with eyes that are moist.
GUTMAN
(softly)
Ah!...
Cairo licks his lips, works his hands together. The girl's
lower lip is between her teeth. Everyone, including Spade,
is breathing heavily. Gutman puts the bird down on the
table, fumbles in a pocket.
It is it!

GUTMAN
But we will make sure.

Sweat glistens on his round cheeks. His fingers twitch as
he takes out a gold pocket-knife, opens it. Cairo and the
girl stand close to him, one on either side. Spade stands
back a little where he can watch the boy as well as the
group at the table. Gutman turns the bird upside-down,
scratches an edge of its base with the knife. Black enamel
comes off in tiny curls exposing gray metal beneath.
CAMERA MOVES TO:

CLOSEUP - THE BIRD
as Gutman's blade bites into the metal, turning back a thin
curving shaving. Gutman's hands twist the bird around and
the knife hacks at its head.

CLOSE SHOT - GROUP
Gutman's breath hisses between his teeth. His face becomes
turgid with hot blood. He hacks wildly at the bird... its
head, throat, breast. Then suddenly he lets knife and bird
bang down on the table, wheels to confront Spade.
GUTMAN
(hoarsely)
It's a fake!
Spade's face is somber. His nod is slow. His eyes detach
themselves from the scarred black bird, travel to Brigid's.
SPADE
(growls into her face)
All right. You've had your little
joke. Now tell us about it.
BRIGID
(cries)
No, Sam, no! That's the one I
got from Kemidov, I swear.
Joel Cairo thrusts himself between Spade and Gutman, emits
words in a shrill, spluttering strain.
CAIRO
(screaming -- to Gutman)
You bungled it! You and your stupid
attempt to buy it. Kemidov caught
on to how valuable it was!
(tears run down
his face and
he dances up
and down)
No wonder we had so little trouble
stealing it! You imbecile! You
bloated idiot!
(he puts his hands
to his face and
blubbers)
Gutman's jaw sags. He blinks with vacant eyes, then he
collects himself -- again becomes the jovial, smiling fat
man.
GUTMAN
(good-naturedly)
Yes... That is the Russian's hand.
There's no doubt of it.
(to Cairo)
Well, sir, what do you suggest?
(MORE)

GUTMAN (CONT'D)
Shall we stand here and shed tears
and call each other names or shall
we...
(smiling like a cherub)
...go to Istanbul?
The Greek takes his hands from his face.

His eyes bulge.

CAIRO
(stammers)
You are...
(amazement makes
him speechless)
The fat man pats his fat hands together and his eyes
twinkle.
GUTMAN
(voice a throaty purr)
For seventeen years I have wanted
that little item and have been
trying to get it. If I must spend
another year on the quest -- well,
sir -- that will be an additional
expenditure in time of only...
(his lips move
silently as he
calculates)
...five and fifteen-seventeenths
percent...
Cairo giggles, then cries:
CAIRO
I go with you.
Spade starts slightly, looks from right to left. The
others, observing Spade's movements, also look around.
boy is gone.

The

GUTMAN
Wilmer!... What?...
Spade goes to the corridor.

LONG SHOT - CORRIDOR
standing open SHOOTING over Spade's shoulder, as he looks
down the empty corridor. He closes the door and returns to
the others in the living room.

SPADE
(sourly)
A swell lot of thieves!
GUTMAN
We have little enough to boast
about sir, but the world hasn't
come to an end just because we've
run into a little set-back.
(he extends his
hand palm up)
I'll have to ask for that envelope,
sir.
SPADE
(wooden-faced)
I held up my end -- you got your
dingus. It's your hard luck, not
mine, it wasn't what you wanted.
GUTMAN
(persuasively)
Now come, sir, we've all failed and
there's no reason for expecting any
of us to bear the whole brunt.
He brings his right hand from behind him. In it is a small
pistol ornately engraved and inlaid with silver and gold
and mother-of-pearl.
GUTMAN
In short, sir, I must ask you to
return my ten thousand.
Spade's face does not change. He shrugs, takes the
envelope from his pocket. He starts to hold it out to
Gutman, hesitates, opens the envelope, takes out one of the
bills. He puts it into his trouser pocket. Then he tucks
the envelope's flap in over the other bills and holds the
envelope out to Gutman.
SPADE
That will take care of my time and
expenses.
Gutman, after a little pause, imitates Spade's shrug and
accepts the envelope.
GUTMAN
Now, sir, we will say goodbye to
you unless you care to undertake
the Istanbul expedition with us...
You don't?...
(MORE)

GUTMAN (CONT'D)
Well, sir, frankly, I'd like to have
you along. You're a man of nice judgment
and many resources. Now that there is
no alternative, I am sure that you'll
somehow manage the police without
a fall-guy.
SPADE
I'll make out all right.
GUTMAN
Well, sir, the shortest farewells
are the best... Adieu.
(he makes a portly bow)
And to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy,
I leave the Rara Avis there on
the table...
(he waves toward
the bird)
...as a little momento.
Gutman and Cairo withdraw, Cairo preceding him down the
short hall and through the corridor door. Spade does not
look at Brigid but stands motionless, his eyes gloomy under
a forehead drawn down until the SOUND of the elevator comes
OVER SCENE. Then he goes to the telephone.

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AT TELEPHONE
takes the receiver off the hook and dials a number.
watches him, a slight frown on her face.
SPADE
(into phone)
Hello... Is Sergeant Polhaus there?
...Please... This is Samuel Spade.
(he stares into space,
waiting, then:)
Hello, Tom... I've got something
for you... Here it is... Thursby
and Jacoby were shot by a kid named
Wilmer Cook, about twenty years old,
five feet six inches tall. In gray
woolen suit, gray single-breasted
overcoat and hat, shirt with soft
attached collar and a light crepe
silk tie. He's working for a man
named Casper Gutman. You can't miss
Gutman. He must weigh three hundred
pounds... That fellow Cairo is in
with them too... Right...
(MORE)

Brigid

SPADE (CONT'D)
They just left here for the Alexandria
Hotel, but they're blowing town so
you'll have to move fast... I don't
think they're expecting a pinch...
Watch yourself when you go up
against the kid... That's right,
Tom... and good luck.
Spade slowly replaces the receiver on the prong. He fills
his chest with air and exhales. His eyes are glittering
between narrowed lids. He turns, takes three swift steps
toward Brigid O'Shaughnessy. The girl, startled by the
suddenness of his approach, lets her breath out in a little
gasp. Spade, face to face with Brigid, looks at her hard
of jaw and eye.
SPADE
They'll talk when they're nailed -about us. We're sitting on dynamite.
We've only got minutes to get set for
the police. Give me all of it fast.
She starts to speak, hesitates, bites her lip.
her by the shoulder, cries angrily:
SPADE

Spade takes

Talk.
BRIGID
(uncertainly)
Where... shall... I... begin?
SPADE
The day you first came to my office...
Why did you want Thursby shadowed?
BRIGID
I told you, Sam, I suspected him
of betraying me and I wanted to
find out.
SPADE
That's a lie! You had Thursby
hooked and you knew it. You wanted
to get him out of the way before
Jacoby came with the loot. Isn't
that so?
Brigid lowers her eyes shame-facedly.
SPADE
What was your scheme?

BRIGID
(timidly)
I thought that if he saw someone
following him, he might be
frightened into going away.
SPADE
Miles hadn't many brains but he
wasn't clumsy enough to be spotted
the first night. You must have told
Thursby he was being followed.
BRIGID
I told him.
(catches her breath,
tortures her lower lip)
I told him... Yes... But please
believe me, Sam. I wouldn't have
told him if I had thought Floyd
would kill him. I wouldn't for
a minute -SPADE
If you thought he wouldn't kill
Miles, you were right, Angel.
BRIGID
(her upraised face
holds utter astonishment)
Didn't he?
SPADE
Miles hadn't many brains but he
had too many years of experience
as a detective to be caught like
that -- by a man he was shadowing
-- up a blind alley with his gun
tucked away in his hip and his
overcoat buttoned.
(he takes his hand
away from her
shoulder, looks
at her for a long
moment, then:)
But he would have gone up there
with you, Angel. He was just
dumb enough for that. He'd have
looked you up and down and licked
his lips and gone grinning from
ear to ear. And then you could
have stood as close to him as you
liked in the dark and put a hole
through him with the gun you had
gotten from Thursby that evening.

Brigid shrinks back from him until the edge of the table
stops her.
BRIGID
(staring with
terrified eyes)
Don't -- don't talk to me like that,
Sam. You know I didn't... You know -SPADE
Stop it!
(he glances at the clock)
The police will be blowing in any
minute now. Talk!
BRIGID
(puts the back of
her hand to her
forehead)
Oh, why do you accuse me of such a
terrible...?
SPADE
(very low -- impatient)
This isn't the spot for the
school-girl act. The pair of us
are sitting under the gallows.
He grasps her wrists forcing her to stand up straight in
front of him. Her face becomes suddenly haggard.
SPADE
Why did you shoot him?
BRIGID
(voice hushed and
troubled)
I didn't mean to at first. I
didn't really but when I saw that
Floyd couldn't be frightened, I
-- I can't look at you and tell
you this, Sam.
(she starts to sob,
clings to him)
SPADE
You thought Thursby would tackle him
and one or the other of them would
go down. If Thursby was the one,
then you were rid of him. If it was
Miles, then you could see that
Thursby was caught and you'd be rid
of him. That it?

BRIGID
S -- something -- like -- that.
SPADE
And when you found that Thursby
didn't mean to tackle him, you
borrowed the gun and did it
yourself. Right?
She nods mutely.
SPADE
You didn't know then that Gutman was
here hunting for you... You didn't
suspect that or you wouldn't have
been trying to shake your protector.
But you knew Gutman was here when
you heard Thursby had been shot and
you knew you needed another
protector -- so you came back to me.
She puts her hands up around the back of his neck pushing
his head down until his mouth all but touches hers.
BRIGID
Yes, but -- Oh, sweetheart, it
wasn't only that. I would have
come back to you sooner or later.
From the very first instant I saw
you I knew...
He puts his arms around her holding her tight to him.
SPADE
(tenderly)
You Angel! Well, if you get a
good break, you'll be out of San
Quentin in twenty years and you
can come back to me then.
She draws away from him slightly, throws her head far back
to stare up at him, uncomprehending.
SPADE
(tenderly)
I hope they don't hang you, Precious,
by that sweet neck.
He puts his hand up and caresses her throat. In an instant
she is out of his arms back against the table crouching,
both hands spread over her throat. Her face is wild-eyed,
haggard. Her mouth opens and closes.

BRIGID
(in a small,
parched voice)
You're not?...
(she can get no
other words out)
Spade's face is damp with sweat now. His mouth smiles
and there are smile wrinkles around his glittering eyes.
SPADE
(gently)
I'm going to send you over. The
chances are you'll get off with
life. That means you'll be out
again in twenty years. You're
an angel! I'll wait for you.
(he clears his
throat)
If they hang you, I'll always
remember you.
Brigid drops her hands, stands erect. Her face becomes
smooth and untroubled except for the faint est of dubious
glints in her eyes. She smiles back at him.
BRIGID
Don't, Sam. Don't say that -- even
in fun. Oh, you frightened me for
a moment. I really thought -- you
do such wild and unpredictable
things...
She breaks off, thrusts her head forward and stares deep
into his eyes. The flesh around her mouth shivers and fear
comes back into her eyes. She puts her hands to her throat
again. Spade laughs. His laugh is a croak.
SPADE
Don't be silly. You're taking
the fall.
BRIGID
But -- but, Sam, you can't! Not
after what we've been to each
other. You can't!
(she takes a long
trembling breath)
You've been playing with me -- only
pretending you cared -- to trap me
like this. You didn't -- care at
all. You -- don't -- l -- love me.

The muscles holding his smile stand out like walls.
SPADE
I think I do. What of it? I
won't play the sap for you.
BRIGID
(tears come to her eyes)
You know it is not like that!
can't say that!

You

SPADE
I am saying it. You've never played
square with me for half an hour at
a stretch since I've known you.
Brigid blinks her tears away, takes a few steps backward,
stands looking at him, straight and proud.
BRIGID
You know, down deep in your heart
you know that in spite of anything
I've done, I love you.
He puts his hand back on her shoulder, the hand shakes and
jerks.
SPADE
I don't care who loves who. I'm
not going to play the sap for you.
I won't walk in Thursby's -- and
I don't know how many others -footsteps. You killed Miles and
you're going over for it.
She takes his hand from her shoulder, holds it close to her
face.
BRIGID
Why must you do this to me, Sam?
Surely Mr. Archer wasn't as much
to you as -He is no longer smiling. He pulls his hand away from her.
His wet face is set hard and deeply lined. His eyes burn
madly.
SPADE
Listen... This won't do any good.
You'll never understand me but I'll
try once and then give it up.
Listen... When a man's partner is
killed, he's supposed to do
something about it.
(MORE)

SPADE (CONT'D)
It doesn't make any difference what
you thought of him. He was your partner
and you're supposed to do something
about it. Then it happens we're in
the detective business. Well, when
one of your organization gets killed,
it's bad business to let the killer
get away with it -- bad all around
-- bad for every detective
everywhere.
BRIGID
You don't expect me to think that
these things you're saying are
sufficient reason for sending me to
the...?
SPADE
Wait till I'm through. Then you can
talk. Third. I've no earthly
reason to think I can trust you and
if I did this and got away with it,
you'd have something on me you could
use whenever you wanted to. Next:
since I've got something on you, I
couldn't be sure you wouldn't decide
to put a hole in me some day.
Fifth. I wouldn't even like the
idea of thinking that there might be
one chance in a hundred that you'd
played me for a sucker. And sixth:
But that's enough. All those are on
one side. Maybe some of them are
unimportant. I won't argue about
that. But look at the number of
them. Now, on the other side we've
got what? All we've got is that
maybe you love me and maybe I love
you.
BRIGID
(whispers)
You know whether you love me or not.
SPADE
Maybe I do.
He looks hungrily from her hair to her feet and up to her
eyes again.

SPADE
What of it? Maybe next month I won't.
I've been through it before. I'll
have some rotten nights after I've
sent you over but that'll pass.
(he takes her
by the shoulders,
bends her back
leaning over her)
If all I've said doesn't mean
anything to you, forget it and we'll
make it just this. I won't because
all of me wants to -- regardless of
consequences -- and because you've
counted on that with me the same as
you counted on that with the
others...
(he takes his
hands from
her shoulders,
lets them fall
to his side)
She puts her hands up to his cheeks, draws his face down
toward her again.
BRIGID
Look at me and tell me the truth.
Would you have done this to me if
the Falcon had been real and you
had been paid your money?
SPADE
Don't be too sure I'm as crooked
as I'm supposed to be. That kind
of reputation might be good business
bringing in high-priced jobs and
making it easier to deal with the
enemy.
She looks at him, says nothing.
a little.

Spade moves his shoulders

SPADE
But a lot of money would have been
at least one more item on your side
of the scales.
BRIGID
(whispers)
If you loved me, you'd need nothing
more on that side.

SPADE
(his voice a
hoarse creak)
I won't play the sap for you.
She puts her mouth to his slowly and is in his arms when
the doorbell RINGS. Before he releases her he calls:
SPADE
Come in.

MED. SHOT - ROOM - ANGLE ON DOOR
Lieutenant Dundy, Tom Polhaus and two other detectives
enter. They look back and forth from Spade to the girl.
SPADE
Hello, Tom... Got them?
POLHAUS
(nods)
Got them.
SPADE
Swell... Here's another one for you.
(he pushes Brigid forward)
She killed Miles -- and I've got
some exhibits.
He goes to the closet, unlocks the door, steps into
the closet.
SPADE'S VOICE
(from closet)
The boy's guns and one of Cairo's
-- and a thousand dollar bill I was
supposed to be bribed with.
He comes out of the closet, gives the guns to Polhaus.
SPADE
And that black statuette on the
table there that all the fuss
was about...
He turns to Dundy, draws his brows together, leans forward
to peer into the lieutenant's face, starts to laugh.
SPADE
What's the matter with your little
playmate, Tom? He looks heart-broken.
I bet when he heard Gutman's story
he thought he had me at last.

POLHAUS
(grumbles)
Cut it out, Sam.
(he looks uneasily
at his superior)
Anyway, we got it from Cairo. Gutman's
dead. The kid had just finished
shooting him when we got there.
SPADE
(nods)
Ought to have expected that.
(picks up his
hat, puts it on)
Shall we be getting down to the
Hall?
Polhaus nods. He picks up the Falcon. Spade leads the way
out of the apartment. Dundy takes out handcuffs, snaps
them on the girl's wrists. They follow Spade out. Brigid's
face and movements are like a sleepwalker's.

INT. SPADE'S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING
Effie is not behind her desk. The door opens and Spade
enters. His face is dull, pasty in color but its lines are
strong. The door to the inner office is open and Spade
goes in CAMERA FOLLOWING.

INT. INNER OFFICE
Effie stands by the window. The girl's brown eyes are
peculiarly enlarged and there's a queer twist to her mouth.
She watches him put his hat on the desk.
SPADE
Morning, Angel.
There's a copy of the "Morning Express" on the desk.
points to it, grins.
SPADE
(mockingly)
So much for your woman's intuition.
EFFIE
(in a queer, tight voice)
You did that, Sam, to her?
SPADE
Your Sam's a detective.

Spade

He looks sharply at her, then goes over to her, puts his
arm around her waist, his hand on her hips.
SPADE
She did kill Miles, Angel...
(snaps his fingers)
...off-hand, like that.
The girl escapes from his arm.
EFFIE
(brokenly)
Don't, please... I know you're
right... but anyway...
Spade's face becomes lumpy. Dull before, it is leaden now.
OVER SCENE the SOUND of the corridor door knob rattling.
Effie Perine goes quickly into the outer office, shutting
the door. Spade remains standing by the window
leaden-faced, staring -- at nothing. After a moment, the
door opens and Effie comes in again, shutting it behind
her.
EFFIE
(in a small flat voice)
Iva is here.
Spade, looking at nothing, nods almost imperceptibly.
SPADE
Yes...
(he shivers -- then:)
Well... send her in.
FADE OUT.
THE END
