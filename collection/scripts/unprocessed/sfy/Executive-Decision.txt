EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD (NICOSIA, CYPRUS) - LATE AFTERNOON

14

FROM the sun we SLOWLY TILT DOWN INTO the courtyard, the
MOVE ENDING as an explosion of white doves, fluttering
into the air, revealing a Muslim wedding party, the
guests gathered around the bride and groom, both early
20s. The attendants are all well-dressed, affluent
Arabs, most in western attire.
SUBTITLES:

NICOSIA, CYPRUS

Cautiously, the bride looks up, toward a balcony... Where
four men, strategically positioned, watch the proceedings
below. The men, all Arabs in casual western attire, are
focused not on the wedding party but the balconies and
windows around them. Deep in the shadows, a fifth man,
wearing dark glasses, is barely visible.
15

EXT. BALCONY - LATE AFTERNOON

15

The fifth man emerges, removing his dark glasses: the
terrorist ABD SA'UD JAFFA, a name synonymous with death.
of medium height, late 50s, he imparts an instant, chilling presence: skin soft and paunchy, dark circles of
flesh beneath his eyes -- heartless, cold as ice, bespeaking evil and treachery. As we study his face the
following SUBTITLES APPEAR:
Abd Sa'ud Jaffa, once the most
notorious and feared terrorist in
the world, now a desperate, hunted
man, his sanctuaries nearly
exhausted, betrayed by even his own
people.

Beside him is his chief of staff, ALI NAGI HASSAN, early
30s, a complex, highly-intelligent man, responsible for
Jaffa's security and middle man to outside organizations.
A man of considerable power but exercised only on behalf
and at the behest of Jaffa -- an man who never dictates
policy, only carrying it out. At the moment, he is
extremely anxious at this careless exposure of a man
carrying death warrants even from his own people. Ali
glances at his watch.
ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
Jaffa, we must go. We have stayed
too long. There are many on this
island who would betray you.
Jaffa turns, holding up his hand in a gesture of
restraint. He focuses on his beautiful daughter below,
radiant in this moment. He motions to her, indicating an
adjoining courtyard below. She excuses herself from the
party, Jaffa turning to descend a staircase. Ali is
upset by this recklessness but dogged in his determination to maintain security. He turns to one of the
guards.
ALI HASSAN

Check the street, then bring up
the cars.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

Elegant, a stone fountain as the centerpiece. Jaffa extends his hands to his daughter who complies, obediently,
she too in awe of this powerful, dangerous man, a man she
has rarely seen. Jaffa embraces her and then presses
something into her hand, a small gilded box. He speaks
softly to her.
Suddenly Ali is there. He nods differentially to the
daughter and then whispers anxiously to Jaffa.
ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
The plane cannot wait any longer.
We must go, please.
Jaffa bids a final farewell to his daughter and then
turns, nodding quickly to Ali.

We go.

Jaffa, Ali and a bodyguard enter. Emerging from a room
are three men, one of whom is dressed identically to
Jaffa, his body type and face, very similar to Jaffa.
The double makes momentary eye contact with Jaffa and
Ali. Jaffa nods his approval. The man puts on dark
glasses and the decoy team heads rapidly down the hall.

removes his necktie and replaces his business suit coat
with a sports jacket, a man always in hiding.

be in the other car. Go with God.
Jaffa briefly touches Ali on the shoulder, a quick nod
from Ali and Jaffa leaves, escorted by three bodyguards.

EXT. NICOSIA HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

Now parked in the curved driveway is a Fiat sedan, a
driver behind the wheel.
Another car is parked in front of the Fiat, its driver
unloading baggage for an Orthodox Greek priest who stands
waiting on the sidewalk, eyes half-closed, feeling the
heat of the sun on his upturned face.
From the hotel lobby, two of Jaffa's guards emerge, one
standing lookout, the other walking quickly to the Fiat.
Looking cautiously about he leans into the driver, giving
instructions. The driver starts the car but before he
can back up, a taxi whips in behind, trapping it between
the two cars.
Three men, obviously drunk, stumble from the cab and
head for the lobby, arm-in-arm, talking loudly in German.
The terrorist beside the Fiat moves towards the cab,
shouting at the driver to back up. The taxi driver
emerges, shouting back at the terrorist. They meet at
the rear of the car, arguing. Suddenly the taxi driver
reaches to his back, whipping free a silenced .22 Beretta
automatic. In a flash, the gun is under the chin of the
bodyguard, a soft THUMP as the GUN is FIRED.
The driver lays the dead bodyguard in the street, swinging out and around the car, leveling, FIRING TWICE, the
driver in the Fiat slumping down in the seat.
At the same moment, the three drunken men reach the lobby
doors, one of them pulling a silenced pistol, pressing it
into the lookout's stomach, FIRING. As he sits the dead
man into the base of a potted tree, the other two push
through the doors.
18

INT. LOBBY - DAY

18

As Jaffa and the remaining guard descend the stairs, a
BUSINESSMAN, seated at a couch folds a paper and picking
up a briefcase, follows in behind them.
The two boisterous drunks spill through the doors but as
they approach Jaffa and his bodyguard, pull their pistols
as the Businessman moves in from behind, shoving a pistol
into the bodyguard's back, a quick spin, another soft
THUMP and the bodyguard drops to the floor.
As the stunned patrons and employees look on, Jaffa is
moved quickly toward the doors, the Businessman speaking
into a lapel mike on his suit.
AGENT (BUSINESSMAN)
(in English)
We have number one. Move.

The three men push Jaffa out the door and down the
stairs.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

19

A late-model MERCEDES SQUEALS INTO VIEW, the back door
flying open as more agents leap out. Jaffa is shoved
into the back seat.
Just then, Jaffa's backup car pulls around the corner and
into the driveway. The three terrorists inside realize
what is happening, the doors fling open, their weapons
drawn.
At this moment, the Greek priest, who has been backing
away in mock horror at the kidnapping, clears a MACH TEN
MACHINE GUN from his robes, his driver pulling a similar
weapon from the trunk. The two OPEN FIRE, the terrorists
in the backup car disappearing in a hail of EXPLODING
GLASS and ruptured metal. The priest and driver jump
into their car, pulling out.
As the MERCEDES PEELS OUT behind the priest's car, the
businessman leaps into the taxi, hiking out the window
and over the roof, FIRING several rounds into the tires
and radiator of the Fiat with a SILENCED PISTOL. A second
later, one of the priest's suitcases on the sidewalk
EXPLODES, a dense cloud of C.S. gas enveloping the area,
providing cover.

INT. HOTEL - UPPER BALCONY - DAY

Ali Hassan, hearing the faint but distinctive SILENCED
SHOTS, rushes from the room, a machine pistol in his
hand. Seeing the abduction below he leaps from the
balcony onto the roof, running across the tiles towards
the street.
He sights in on the Businessman, hiked out over the cab,
but stops short, seeing the silhouette of Jaffa, framed
in the back seat, too dangerous a shot for a machine gun.
Unwilling to risk hitting him, Ali throws out his arms,
screaming a cry of defiance and revenge, his eyes wild
with anger and hatred.
As the car whips its way through the narrow streets, we
hear the following VOICE OVER as we view the series of
news reports of terrorist activities including the bombing of a disco; aircraft wreckage; bombing of a military
hospital, etc:

A shimmering collage of heat-waves and OUT-OF-FOCUS
images.
SUBTITLES:

ATHENS, GREECE -- 1 MONTH LATER.

Appearing mid-point in this silent, shimmering field,
a black dot slowly expands into an amorphous sphere, two
unattached, horizontal bands appearing on either side,
growing towards the center. Suspended in mid-air,
slowly drifting forward, the gigantic object resolves,
revealing a Boeing 747, the monarch of the air, descending directly towards us.
As if defying gravity, the mammoth airship seems suspended as it settles towards the earth. The runway appears, the 747 FILLING the SCREEN as it passes silently
overhead... shattering the silence as three-quarters of
a million pounds of modern-age miracle return to earth:
an ear-splitting SCREAM and erupting smoke as tires
smash into the tarmac, followed by the THUDDING GROAN
of the suspension as it absorbs the awesome weight of
the plane. The 230 feet of hurtling mass ROARS down the
tarmac towards the terminal buildings in the b.g.
22

INT. PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY

22

Where a variety of international travelers pass through
the security and X-ray control area, several traveling in
groups, their tour leaders dealing with last minute
problems and questions.
Among the passengers is a man, late 40s, European,
carrying a small, laptop computer which is being checked
by X-ray and a bomb analyzer, a device searching for the
scent of plastic explosives. Collecting his computer
from the inspection, he lights up a cigarette, looking
nervously about him as he does.
Behind him, a dark-complected MAN, late 20s, handsome,
Mediterranean, dressed in sporty, but expensive outdoor
clothing, is insisting that his two heavily-ladened
camera bags be hand inspected by the agent.
23

INT. BAGGAGE SORTING AREA - DAY
As baggage from the terminal is carried along conveyor
belts and loaded into aluminum baggage containers,
security men and dogs move against the flow, the dogs
eagerly sniffing for the tell-tale scent of drugs or
explosives.

panels are lowered, isolating the galley from the rest
of the hold, the baggage containers are rolled and locked
into place.

EXT. 747 LOADING AREA - DAY

The massive fuel lines, pumping thousands of pounds of
kerosene into the airframe are pulled aside as mechanics
perform last minute checks on tires, landing gear and
engines, using ladders and lifts to gain access to the
belly and wings, ten feet above the ground.
26

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN AREA - DAY

26

Where twelve flight attendants are being briefed by the
CHIEF STEW reading to them from a computer manifest.
Among the attendants is FRAN, 32. Aside from being physically striking, she possesses an easy, relaxed manner and
confident bearing.
CHIEF STEW
Our Captain today is Brad Stewart,
based in New York. We've got a full
load, 406 passengers. Also a
Federal air marshal, in 13-B and
he's carrying. Otherwise you know
your assignments so let's get ready
for pre-check.
The attendants move to their stations to prepare for the
long flight. GO WITH Fran and another attendant, JUDY,
28, black. By their smiles and animated conversation, we
understand they are close friends.
In a moment, the first of the 406 passengers begin filing
on board, looking for their seats, stowing their luggage,
assisted by the attendants.
The PHOTOJOURNALIST is having some difficulty placing
his two camera bags into the overhead. Fran appears.
FRAN
Sir, I can check those for you.
He turns, somewhat startled and then smiles. He is a
very handsome, exotic-looking man and the effect on Fran
is not unnoticed.

FRAN
Let me see what I can do.
With a little expert arranging, she slides the bags into
the compartment.
Thank you...

Fran.

PHOTOJOURNALIST
FRAN
(smiling)
Have a nice flight.

She walks away towards the forward compartment.
An American family, husband and wife and two children,
boy and girl, take their seats. The children are seated
separately at window seats, tended to by their mother,
storing toys into the upper compartment, the kids, DAVID
and KAREN, playing with their latest Nintendo game.
A priest and two Greek orphans, boys, seven and eight,
take their seats in the center section, directly across
from the two American children. The children study each
other closely, the orphans dressed in shorts and knee
socks, the Americans in Reeboks, baggy pants and
T-shirts. The little girl seems totally mesmerized by
the two. She smiles warmly at them.

seat alongside him.
As she attempts to stow some of her luggage in the overhead, several souvenirs slide from a bag, hitting the
small computer, resting on the man's lap. Startled, he
grabs the computer, looking up angrily at the Woman. He
then stows the machine beneath his seat.
WOMAN
(defensive)
Well I'm sorry. I didn't do it on
purpose.
The man ignores her, the woman, still mumbling, settles
uncomfortably into her seat, making sure to avoid any
further contact with him.

The massive aircraft taxis into position and holds. We
hear the RADIO CHATTER between the cockpit and the control tower as final run-up tests are performed.
When the final clearance has been given, the ENGINES are
pushed to near red-line, the exhaust obscuring the runway in a shimmering wall of heat. Within two miles, the
plane is nearing 150 mph and beginning to lift as
millions of pounds of air are sucked into the SCREAMING
ENGINES. A moment later the plane clears the runway,
pulling magnificently into the sky.

INT. 747 COCKPIT - DAY

As the plane banks, turning into its outward course, we
hear the final course assignments and weather conditions
from the TOWER. A sense of calm settles over the cockpit,
the crew adjusting for the long flight.
31

INT. 747 FORWARD CABIN AREA - DAY

31

The "fasten seatbelt" sign winks off, the attendants and
passengers settling into their in-flight routines. Moments later a man leaves his seat and we follow his legs
as he walks down the aisle, stopping at a seat, the
Photojournalist casually looking up before returning to
his magazine. The man, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, hair
and mustache salt and pepper gray, skin slightly claylike, looks like a conservative businessman or professor.
He opens the overhead, removing one of the camera bags.
The man moves on, towards the mid-cabin bathrooms.
32

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

32

The grey-haired man stares into the mirror before removing his glasses, pulling free his wig, revealing black,
slicked-back hair. Using a towel he wipes the makeup
from his face, looking back at himself in the mirror:
Ali Hassan.
He removes from the camera bag two 6x7 reflex cameras.
Turning them over, he tears away the bases, an expertly
molded and painted section of plaster, revealing the
slides of two automatic pistols. He then removes two
camera pistol grips, pulling each away from its unit,
exposing firing pin and hammer mechanisms. He unscrews a
500mm mirror lens. Behind a dummy photo of the iris, are
secreted bullets in a long roll of lead foil. He continues to assemble the weapons...

INT. FORWARD CABIN AREA - DAY

Ali leaves the bathroom. He passes another Arab in the
aisle, handing him one of the weapons, secreted in a
magazine. This man walks to the front of the plane and
ascends the staircase.
At the same time, a third Arab leaves his seat, walking
to the forward galley area. He waits until the attendant leaves her station and then slips into the elevator.
34

INT. LOWER FORWARD GALLEY AREA - DAY

34

The door to the elevator bursts open as the third terrorist storms into the galley, slamming Judy across the
chest, knocking her unconscious against the bulkhead,
her head striking the counter with a sickening THUD as
she falls.
The terrorist begins tearing into the food carts scattering several of the trays to the floor. A moment later
he finds what he is looking for, several automatic
weapons and two grenades, hidden among the rows of food
trays.
35

INT. UPPER DECK - BUSINESS CLASS - COCKPIT AREA - DAY
The Terrorist approaches the cockpit door, an ATTENDANT,
working in business class seeing him.
ATTENDANT
Sir, the bathroom is to the right.
He nods. As she turns back to her work, the Terrorist
pulls from his pocket a small wedge of plastic explosive with a fuse attached. Pressing the plastic into
the seam by the door latch and pulling the igniter, he
calmly steps back, revealing his handgun.
A sharp EXPLOSION blasts the door free from the lock.
As the startled passengers watch in shock, the Terrorist
rushes inside, brutally pistol-whipping the flight
engineer as he stands, then pressing the muzzle into
the pilot's neck.
Expertly the Terrorist reaches up, turning off several
overhead switches, and then turns to the navigator's
station, shutting down the radio and radar. He hands
the captain a sheet of paper.
TERRORIST
Your new course, Captain.
I am a pilot. No tricks.

INT. LOWER PASSENGER LEVEL - DAY

The passengers reacting in confusion to the sound of the
explosion. Ali walks past a U.S. Navy serviceman, now
starting to rise to his feet. Ali turns, FIRING TWICE,
point-blank into the man's chest, the high-caliber bullets ripping through the seat, also killing a woman sitting behind the sailor.
Behind him there is a CRASH. Ali spins, raising his
weapon, stopping as he sees an attendant, NANCY, backing
into the partition, holding her hands over her face, her
eyes wide with fear and horror. Ali studies her, calmly,
appraisinlgy and then dismissing her, hands the weapon to
Kahlil, the photojournalist. As if his point has been
made, Ali walks swiftly down the aisle, not bothering to
look at another passenger.
Somewhere in the main cabin, a hand gripping a .357
Magnum, partially removed from a belt holster, hesitates
before returning the revolver. Carefully, the man's
hand unsnaps the holster, sliding it and the gun down
to his feet where it is secreted in a dress boot, pants
leg covering it. Next his Federal I.D. wallet is slipped
between the seats.
A wave of fear rolls through the passengers as they confront the horrible reality -- hijacked. In a SERIES OF
SHOTS, we see passengers quickly hiding jewelry, watches,
Star of David medallions, passports, diamond rings.
37

INT. MID-SECTION WORK STATION - DAY

37

As a terrorist, shouting in Arabic, pushes Fran and
Nancy into the station, shoving them roughly into their
jump seats. As Fran sits, she looks up, seeing the
passenger manifest, hanging from the wall. Her eyes go
to a name: Edward Strickler, 13-B, United States Federal Air Marshal.
As the terrorist turns his back, she pulls the manifest
from the clipboard, slipping it into a trash receptacle.
She looks up, just as Ali steps into the space. He
removes his suit coat, hanging it over some work aprons
on the bulkhead. Lifting the intercom handset from the
wall, he speaks calmly, in perfect English.
ALI HASSAN
My name is 'Al Iqab.' In a few
hours we will return to London,
refuel and then travel to the
Middle East. You are to remain in
your seats and do as you are told.
Anyone disobeying my orders will
be shot.

catching Fran's stare, looking into his cold, calculating
eyes as he does.
ALI
There is no need for that. Keep
them seated and maintain security.
I'm going to the cockpit.
He stares at Fran a moment and then turns away from
Kahlil, leaving the area, Fran seeing an expression of
confusion on Kahlil's face.

oblivious to the indignant stares and murmured comments.
The Maitre d', offended at this incursion follows after
him.

Excuse me, sir, but may I help you?
The man reaches the center of the restaurant.
MAITRE D'
Do you have a reservation...
The man turns, the Maitre d' staring into the glazed eyes
of death. In that frozen moment, the Maitre d' notices
the man is sweating heavily, his breathing shallow.
The man slowly opens his coat, revealing a canvas vest to
which are taped a dozen blocks of plastic explosive,
fused and wired together in series. He holds out his
arm, revealing a detonator switch, crudely taped to his
palm, two wires running up his sleeve.
A frozen moment of hesitation and then the man, lifting
his face, eyes rolling upward, screams something in
Arabic and presses the detonator...

you are on leave, mister, thirty
days, in preparation for
reassignment to staff headquarters.

Just where I want you, a nine to
fiver, like it or not. And the
next thirty days are going to be
devoted exclusively to me...
The sound of the HELICOPTER has increased. Through the
curtains Travis sees a blurred movement over the beach,
an army 500C helicopter feathering out, settling
to earth.
Lynn stares at the helicopter, face stricken, hands moving
defensively to her breast. An officer in camouflage
fatigues runs towards the house, a briefcase under his
arm. Travis turns, looking at Lynn, seeing once again the
look of betrayal, resignation, he has seen from her so
many times before. Unable to speak she breaks away,
entering the bathroom.

INT. ANTEROOM - NIGHT

Outside the Joint Chiefs Operations Center, where PETER
CAHILL, early forties, intellectual, slightly hyper, wearing a crumpled corduroy suit and yesterday's shirt, is
gulping coffee from a large paper cup. He looks as if
roused from sleep, only minutes ago. A portable computer
rests at his feet.
Travis and his Staff Officer appear, Cahill looking up.
The two men stare at each other and then Cahill rises.
CAHILL
Colonel Travis?
Travis studies him, remembering.

He nods.

TRAVIS
Cahill. The Jules Verne kid from
Advanced Projects Research. Two
years ago, right? That screwball
experimental airplane you were
trying to justify to the
Appropriations Committee. What
the hell was it called, 'Ramona?'
CAHILL

Ramora.

INT. PENTAGON - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

49A

Spartan but tastefully furnished. In the center of the
room three men are conversing in hushed tones.
GENERAL MIKE SARLOW, head of ISA, the army's CIA, is
speaking while CAPTAIN DAVID GRANT, now dressed in an
army uniform, studies carefully the reactions of an
ARAB DIPLOMAT, late 50's, compassionate but penetrating
eyes, wearing an expensively tailored English suit.
SARLOW
There must be some way to contact
them. Someone he will listen to.
ARAB DIPLOMAT
(cautious)
Jaffa is a pariah to the Arab
community, a total threat to any
hope we have of peace in the
Middle East. No one will have
anything to do with him publicly.
SARLOW
I realize that, but we must try.
ARAB DIPLOMAT
I will do everything possible.
But there is no one politically
to deal with except Ali Hassan.
And he is a true believer. He
will be difficult to deal with.
A very dangerous man.
Sarlow looks at Grant for his assessment, receiving a
solemn nod of agreement.

INT. PENTAGON - ANTEROOM - NIGHT

Some distance down the hallway, a door opens and Sarlow,
Grant and the Arab Diplomat emerge. Travis watches as
they briefly shake hands, the diplomat leaving, escorted
by a waiting Pentagon official. Sarlow and Grant turn
and walk towards the anteroom. As they approach, Travis
appraises them carefully just as the door to the
operations center swings open, a CIA OFFICER appearing.
Gentlemen.

five stories underground, a huge oval-shaped room on
two levels.

The lower level is devoted to a massive communications
center, an intricate collection of telephones, computers,
and printers manned by military operators. On the walls
are a bank of television sets, flanked by huge screens
onto which maps, computer data and video images may be
projected.
The President's crisis-management team stands before one
of the overhead screens on which we see a map of Europe,
indicating the location of the 747, enroute to London.
Leading the team is GEORGE KAPLAN, the President's
National Security Advisor. With him is DIRECTOR NELSON,
head of the CIA (DCI); MAJOR ERWIN PRICE, and ADMIRAL
CHESTER LEWIS of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Along with
Sarlow, Travis and Grant, they listen to another tape
recording by Ali Hassan.
ALI HASSAN (V.O.)
(hard; clipped)
You have witnessed the conviction
of Al Iqab. My instructions will
be given once; no theater, no
negotiation. Jaffa will be taken
to Gatwick Airport, a long-range
private jet provided. With Jaffa's
release, Flight 343 will divert to
Washington, D.C. where half the
prisoners will be exchanged for
fuel and fifteen million in gold
bullion.
(beat)
Jaffa must be airborne by three
P.M., G.M.T., or a second, more
convincing message will be
delivered. All communication
will cease after this message.
Kaplan turns to Travis, studying him, carefully choosing
his words before he speaks.
KAPLAN
Colonel Travis, as you know, the
President is out of the country,
scheduled to meet with the Soviet
Premiere tomorrow. We're in
constant communication with him.
He's been apprised of everything
I am about to tell you.
Kaplan glances at Sarlow and Grant.

KAPLAN
In the past hour, some new, rather
disturbing elements have surfaced,
possibly calling for some
extraordinary measures. That's
why you're here.
Travis looks around at the sober faces staring at him.
He seems to be the center of attention -- as if he's
the last to be brought in on something. He turns
back to Kaplan.
KAPLAN
The immediate situation is this.
The Prime Minister is demanding
Jaffa's release or he'll take
action on his own. We're going
to comply, to gain some time, at
least.
(to Sarlow)
General Sarlow?
GENERAL SARLOW
A number of Arab factions are
willing to attempt negotiations
with Jaffa's group, but unless
the highjackers elect to make
contact, our options are
severely limited.
(looks at Grant)
I'm going to ask Captain Grant to
continue. He's the best expert
we have on Arab terrorists, and
he's been on the highjacking since
we first learned of it.
Grant addresses the group but focuses on Travis, again
as if this is for his benefit. Grant refers to a
series of documents taken from his briefcase.
GRANT
Based upon a voice print, I'm
certain 'Al Iqab' is Ali Hassan,
Jaffa's second in command. For
such a high-ranking member to
actually be in charge is highly
unusual.
He pauses, Travis cautiously acknowledging.
TRAVIS
Yes, highly unusual.

GRANT
Then I'm sure you would also agree,
Colonel, that taking hostages to
spring Jaffa makes sense, but not
coming here. They can secure his
release and never leave Europe.
Again, Travis stares coolly at Grant.
TRAVIS
Obviously Hassan is up to something.
GRANT
Jaffa knew his effectiveness as a
terrorist was over and was in the
process of portraying himself a
moderate, another Arafat. But Ali
has always represented the hard
line, fundamental position.
(beat)
Rather then take a Mossad bullet in
the head he would rather go out
striking a blow at the Great Satan.
The Sword of God's Will.
(beat)
His nom de guerre, 'Al Iqab,' is
deeply rooted in Arabic culture,
associated with suicidal vengeance.
It means: "The Punishment.'
TRAVIS
So, what's the punch line?
Grant refers to an open folder before him.
GRANT
Less than a week ago, a small
Russian army convoy was ambushed
outside of Ashkhabad, near the
Iranian border. Ten men were
killed, a truck hijacked.
He places several satellite photographs on the table,
showing the burned wreckage of several Jeeps and soldiers
lying on the road.
GRANT
Recent intelligence gives us strong
reason to believe Jaffa's group
was responsible.
(beat)
The cargo of that truck consisted
of 42 canisters of DZ-5, being
relocated to a secret storage
facility.

Travis stiffens slightly at the mention of the word.
GRANT
DZ-5 is the latest generation of a
biogenic nerve toxin, far more
lethal than any chemical weapon
we've ever seen...
He places several photographs on the table showing Middle
Eastern tribesmen and soldiers, lying in contorted and
misshapen heaps; one photograph showing a Kurdish tribeswoman clutching a baby, their faces frozen masks of
agony, gasping for their last breath of life.
TRAVIS
(sober)
I'm aware of its capabilities,
Captain.
Grant stops, his briefing finished for the moment.
He looks to Director Nelson, the DCI, who picks up
a computer printout.
DCI
A cross-check of the passenger
and cargo manifests, Colonel,
indicates a shipment of 'art
objects,' leaded pottery, 250
kilos in weight, on board
Flight 343...
(beat)
The point of origin, final
destination and the person assigned
to that shipment are all nonexistent.
Kaplan now resumes, but Travis clearly understands
the situation, Grant carefully studying his reaction.
KAPLAN
We have to consider, Colonel
Travis, the strong possibility that
gaining the release of Jaffa is
only the first phase of a larger
plan...

could expect between 50,000 to
100,000 deaths. Anything inside
a hundred miles of the coastline
would be disastrous.
A frozen moment and then Kaplan looks directly at
Travis.
KAPLAN
(gravely)
Meaning, Colonel Travis, if this
scenario is true, the President
would have no other choice but to
order the plane destroyed.
TRAVIS
(confused)
Yes, sir, no other choice. But I'm
at a loss, Mr. Kaplan. If this
is all true, where does my team fit
in?
Kaplan glances at Grant, then to the DCI.
KAPLAN
Because, we've been told we may
have another option, Colonel.
Which does concern you.
(to Nelson)
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.
Nelson nods to one of his aides who leaves the room.
DCI
It's a wild card, Colonel, but
under the circumstances, it's all
we've got. You've already met, I
think, Peter Cahill, an
aeronautical engineer at DARPA, a
pioneer in stealth technology...

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON a video screen where a computerized blueprint is
displayed, a drawing of a double-walled, ovoid cylinder,
at the top of which is an inner and outer o-ring device:
a series of circular, sucker-like cups, attached to a
collection of pneumatic pumps.
The image changes, an engineer's drawing, showing the
cylinder, similar to a submarine's conning tower,
attached to the top of a radically designed executivestyle jet with stealth characteristics, featuring
swept-back wings and a horizontal, rather than vertical,
tail.
Another drawing shows the cylinder telescoped upward,
several times its original size, the delivery plane now
positioned beneath and mated with an aircraft many times
its size, a giant XB-70 bomber.
Suddenly Travis gets the picture, understanding where he
fits into the loop.
TRAVIS
Jesus H. Christ...
All eyes are on Travis.
TRAVIS
Excuse me, Mr. Kaplan, but I see
where you're going with this. My
team is thoroughly versed in
carrying out assaults on hijacked
aircraft. But on the ground, not
five miles above the earth.
(beat)
I informed Mr. Cahill two years
ago that we had little use for
this 'aircraft' in Special Ops.
This thing was designed to
transfer flight crews to and from
strategic bombers, requiring
special adaptation to the aircraft.
(looks at Cahill)
Its application with a civilian
aircraft was dismissed as posing
too great a risk to the
passengers. A hijacked aircraft
eventually has to land somehwere
where we can deal with it...
Travis realizes the irony of his last statement, even
before Kaplan speaks up.

KAPLAN
This does appear to be the
exception to the rule.
(beat)
We said this was a wild card,
Colonel. But if your team can
board that airplane, determine if
there is a bomb and take control
of the situation, we at least have
a fighting chance. Otherwise,
four hundred and six passengers
will have to be sacrificed.
(sober; intense)
The President does not want to
shoot down that plane, Colonel...
but he will. He cannot risk
50,000 American lives.
(beat)
In his words this is a Hail Mary
pass. He has no other options.
Kaplan continues to look at Travis.
TRAVIS
How much time?
Grant speaks up.
GRANT
You have to be airborne within the
hour.
Travis thinks a moment and then nods, the soldier's
acceptance of duty. He looks at Cahill.
TRAVIS
One question. You have enough
confidence in this gadget to stake
your life on it, under these
circumstances?
CAHILL
It's been modified... the pump's
much stronger... Even without the
mating collar there is an
appropriate hatch on the 747 and
the wide surface area of the
aircraft should be sufficient for
a link-up...
(beat)
I'd have to say I have extreme
confidence in its application,
even under the less than optimum
circumstances.

TRAVIS
Well, good. Because I want you to
go along. I don't want anything
left to chance.
Cahill is stunned. He starts to speak but a withering
look from the DCI shuts him up. Cahill looks sick.
Kaplan speaks up, dealing his last card.
KAPLAN
I think one addition to the team
is called for, Colonel. An expert
in Arabic dialects, someone who
has made a careful study of Ali's
life, who knows how he thinks, how
he operates...
Travis turns and looks at Grant, their eyes locking.
This was unanticipated by Grant and his face shows it.
The Major-General, Travis's boss speaks up.
MAJOR-GENERAL
I see absolutely no need for
Captain Grant's involvement in the
actual operation. He can
accomplish an advisory role right
from here in Operations.
KAPLAN
On the contrary, General, I think
his actual presence could prove
crucial. Captain Grant might be
able to forecast something Ali is
going to do, before he does it.
MAJOR-GENERAL
Mr. Kaplan, it's going to be
difficult enough for the Colonel
and his men...
Travis speaks out.
TRAVIS
Excuse me, General. I'll take
him. He could prove useful.
He fixes Grant with a look that says, "Okay, let's see
how you handle the real thing."

Travis's Special Forces driver is at the wheel, Travis

change from his confident bearing at the Pentagon.
Travis turns in his seat.
TRAVIS
Curious why I didn't vote against
your coming, Captain?
Grant is curious but remains silent.
TRAVIS
Because this whole operation was
your idea, wasn't it? Your little
brainstorm.
The look on Grant's face says it all.
GRANT
That's what I get paid for,
Colonel.
TRAVIS
And my boys get paid for putting
it on the line. I'm not faulting
your ideas, Captain. Like Kaplan

from the beginning. We both play
for the same team, Captain. The
only difference is, you don't have
to pull the trigger.
GRANT
I had no involvement with that
operation, Colonel.
(beat)
But I agree with it in principle.
Jafa is an international criminal
and had to be brought to justice.
Men like that have to know they're
not beyond the reach of the law.
TRAVIS
Law? The only law animals like
Jaffa and Ali understand comes
from the end of a gun.

You should have killed them all
when you had the chance.
Grant reflects on this.
GRANT
Well, that's all a moot point,
isn't it? No matter what, Jaffa
is home free.
A cold look from Travis.
TRAVIS
Don't count on it, Captain.
The Jeep pulls to a halt beside a massive hangar, just as
a CH-46 HELICOPTER ROARS INTO VIEW over the top, quickly
settling to the tarmac, Travis and Grant turning to avoid
the prop wash.
Emerging from the helicopter are seven men, wearing watch
caps, dark green pullovers, black cargo-pocketed pants,
and light weight, crepe-soled boots. Quickly they unload
dark duffel bags and ABS plastic suitcases.

so rakish and streamlined it looks almost in flight just
sitting on the ground. A flight crew, finishing last

their service equipment, the pilots entering the craft.
As the team approaches the plane, Cahill appears from
inside. He calls out to Travis, gesturing towards the men.

weapons, bomb kit, detection and
surveillance gear, and the sleep
agent. Dump the rest! Let's go!
Immediately the team begins digging through the equipment, taking only the essential items, leaving the rest
on the hangar floor. As Travis and Grant stand next to
each other, Travis's Driver appears.
DRIVER
Sir, I have your call to S.A.S
command in London. 'Cousin Reggie'

We PULL BACK to reveal the interior, spartan but functional. Fold-down jump seats accommodate the team, the
rear of the jet devoted to racks of miniaturized electronic and navigational gear. The predominant feature
of the jet, however, is the dome-like appendage swelling
from the ceiling near the cockpit. A pressurized hatch
is located in the center of the dome, surrounded by a
series of gauges, levers and switches.
The ship is intermittently buffeted by turbulence,
obviously not the best of flying conditions. The men

small plastic strip, a magnetic code key, emerges from a

Information implicating the country
who supplied Ali the nerve gas, the
bomb, the diplomatic support needed
to get the highjackers on board.
So damning, so...
TRAVIS
That the U.S. would be forced to
retaliate.
GRANT
In Ali's mind, hopefully so swiftly
and devastatingly, maybe even
nuclear, that a Pan-Arabic war
would result, the focus at the only
plausible target in the region,
Israel.
TRAVIS
And restoring Jaffa as a leading
power in the region as well. Very
clever.

Silent as a tomb. Terrorists armed with automatic
weapons are stationed at various locations on the plane.
All of the window shades have been pulled down.
A terrorist armed with an automatic weapon, pistol and
grenade, moves slowly down the long corridor, his eyes
glaring at the passengers, who sit terrified, unable to
move or speak.

He passes the mid-cabin area where Ali Hassan and two
others have set up a monitoring station, adapted to the
plane's gutted telephone system, consisting of a SHORTWAVE RADIO, over which can be heard a NEWS BROADCAST,
and alongside it, a military field radio.
As the guard nears the front of the plane, he walks
past a terrorist, dragging the two murdered passengers,
now covered in blood-stained blankets, into one of the
forward bathrooms.
We FOCUS ON the PARENTS of Karen and DAVID, whispering
to each other in urgent voices.
WIFE
I want them here, with us.
HUSBAND
No. They're insane. They've
already killed two people. We're
going to sit here...
And do what?

WIFE
The terrorist guard passes by them, then past Karen and
David. As he does, Karen looks across at the two Greek
boys, silent, terrified, the priest beside them deep in
prayer, eyes closed, prayer beads moving through his
fingers. One of the boys notices her, staring back at
her with frightened eyes. Suddenly, on impulse, Karen
stands, moving into the aisle. Her brother reacts,
startled.
DAVID
(under his breath)
Karen! What are you doing!
back here!

But Karen stands in the aisle, holding out to the Greek
boy a Nintendo game, the boy remaining frozen, staring
at her.
Two rows back, Karen's mother looks up, seeing Karen in
the aisle, starts to rise when her husband's hand comes
down firmly on her arm.

No!

HUSBAND
(stern whisper)
Don't move.

Slowly they lean out, trying to get Karen's attention
without alerting the guard.

As Karen holds out the game, the Greek boy reaches out
to accept it... A gun barrel flashes INTO VIEW, the game
snatched from her hand. Terrified faces freeze in place,
priest, children, parents, passengers, as the terrorist
guard stares at the game. Angrily he shoves Karen aside,
shouting at her in Arabic. As Karen begins to cry, her
father, unable to restrain himself, lunges from his chair.
FATHER
You son of a...
The terrorist spins, slamming the butt of his rifle into
the father's chest, driving him back into his seat.
Instantly the barrel of the rifle is pressed hard into
his windpipe, cutting off his air, the father beginning
to choke. His wife reaches out, desperately, pleading...
WIFE
Please, you're choking him...
Please stop it!
But the terrorist presses harder, an angry sneer across
his face, a very ugly situation about to get worse...
Suddenly a hand reaches out, grasping the gun barrel.
Startled the terrorist looks up into Ali's face. Ali
pulls the gun away, carefully backing the guard into the
aisle, speaking softly to him in Arabic. The terrorist
settles but glares back in anger at the father.
Ali kneels to the floor, picking up the game. He
examines it and then hands it to the Greek boy.
He helps Karen into her seat, speaking to her in English.
ALI
You must stay in your seat.
He gently roughs her hair, looking up into the frozen
faces of her parents, and then into the faces of a
dozen other passengers, all staring at him, humbled with
fear. As Ali looks from face to face he sees, perhaps
for the first time, the people, the human souls, who are
destined to die with him in his desperate statement to
the West. He grows agitated and then speaks out, almost
as a parent to a child explaining why the child must be
punished.
ALI
I am not your enemy.

leaders... The supporters and
instigators of the Zionist occupation
of my homeland.

mercy is bestowed upon the innocent
and the righteous.
With a last look he turns and moves down the aisle.

Fran, Nancy and two other attendants, sit in their jump

the others averting him altogether. Fran turns to Nancy,
sitting next to her, obviously still deeply shaken by the
murders she witnessed earlier.
FRAN

Judy's been down there for four
hours. They wouldn't have left
her there alone. Something's

NANCY

Sensing someone's presence, Nancy looks up, the words
freezing in her throat as she looks into Ali's face.
ALI HASSAN

Nancy, frozen with panic, closes her eyes, unable to
move or speak. Ali leans in closer.

The elevator door opens and Fran emerges, followed by
the guard. Immediately her eyes go to the limp form
of Judy, lying against the food carts. She starts to
move to her side, but the guard stops her with the
barrel of his weapon. Slowly she pushes it aside.

Rat attaches a pressure valve to a small stainless steel
cylinder, labeled: "GAS AGENT: SODIUM CHLORAL-HYDRATE."
He re-locks the valve, replacing the cylinder into a
circular, foam-filled nylon carrying case.
Beside him, Charlie opens an aluminum case, marked with
a wide red stripe. Enmeshed in foam is an array of
highly specialized weapons: a four-shot, high-powered
taser unit, equipped with Teflon barbs; lethal-looking
hand shotguns mounted on heavy pistol grips; a shortbarreled impact cannon with several rubber-tipped shells.
Cahill, studying the team, turns to Travis, eyeing the
.22 Beretta automatic strapped to his chest.
CAHILL
Why all the guns?

switch within seconds or run the
risk of being discovered. Just
explain the procedure to Baker...
CAHILL
(adamant)
You don't understand. Opening the
final hatch is complicated, every
phase critical. I can't just tell
someone how to do it. Unless I
can ascertain that the seal is at
the proper vacuum, you may not have
any mission left to accomplish.
Travis considers this, Grant carefully studying him.
TRAVIS
Okay, Cahill. You make your
inspection and open the hatches.
But Baker is going to be right
there behind you. As soon as the
747 is open, you haul ass inside
so Baker can lock off that switch.
But...

CAHILL
TRAVIS
Then, when we're on board, you can

Cahill is obviously not pleased with the idea of going on

final word.
CAHILL

All right, but while the pressure
locks are open, both planes are

The CO-PILOT pulls down a transparent screen, covering
the mid-section of the windshield. He activates an
infra-red viewing field, revealing the wind-foil patterns
flowing over the wings and along the body of the 747,
leaving streaming contrails in its wake, the engines
glowing red-black.
CAHILL
An infra-red imaging device. The
air flow of heated molecular

Suddenly the plane pitches and rocks, encountering a
pattern of turbulence as they enter the wake of the 747.
Moments later, as if through parting clouds, we see a
channel appear, a clear spot underneath the belly of the
plane.
CAHILL
There, the 'sweet-spot.' A valley

the agile craft away from the plunging mass above them.

opens the final hatch, swinging it down into the chamber.
CAHILL

He opens the hatch, revealing the belly of the 747 and
the avionics hatch, surrounded by the heavy neoprene
vacuum-collar. Cahill releases the locking device on

INT. PENTAGON - OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY
The crisis team is fixated on the overhead screen,
plotting the course of the two planes, the course of the
delivery plane fading, dropping away. In a moment it
blinks from the screen.
A RADIO TRANSMISSION from the E2 breaks the stunned
silence.
E2-OPERATOR (V.O.)
Castle Rock, this is Big Eye-6.
We have lost all contact with Hail
Mary.
The Major-General picks up the microphone.
GENERAL
Big Eye-6, this is Castle Rock.
Was delivery accomplished?
E2-OPERATOR (V.O.)
Castle Rock, I can't say. Hail
Mary was attempting delivery when
contact was lost.
A moment of silence, broken by the Director's voice.
DCI
(quietly)
Something must have failed with
the airlock and they depressurized.
Kaplan turns away from the overhead screen, his eyes
cold and hard. He addresses the Admiral.
KAPLAN
Where is the Task Force, Admiral?
The Admiral points to a location on the situation board.
ADMIRAL
Carrier Task Force Six has been
diverted and is heading towards
an intercept point in the Atlantic.
PRESIDENT
Go to Red Alert. Contact the

Cappy is lying on the floor, his face covered in sweat,
writhing in pain as Baker carefully sprays antiseptic
over Cappy's burned hand and forearm, wrapping the area
with gauze bandages.
BAKER
Best I can do for now. I've got
some morphine, take care of that
pain.
CAPPY
No... Might need me... Got to stay
awake...
But as Baker moves Cappy's arm across his chest to
isolate it, Cappy inhales sharply in pain.
CAPPY
Baker... My neck. Whole left
sife... burns like acid.
(moves fingers of
left hand)
All down my arm...
Alarmed, Baker carefully feels behind Cappy's neck,
gingerly palpitating down his neck, stopping at a point
near the shoulder blades. Cappy again winces, nearly
fainting from the pain.
BAKER
There's a depression, a deformity
of C-7...
(looks up)
He's got a fractured vertebrae.
We've got to immobilize him.

FLIGHT ENGINEER
We don't know what happened. But

INT. AVIONICS ROOM - DAY

100E

The Engineer enters the darkened, cramped room, moving
towards the electrical panel. He shines a tiny flashlight on the broken fuse cover, examining the destruction
with a puzzled look. Suddenly he grows wary, slowly
turning, looking down at the floor, into the shadows and
Cappy's sweating, pain-racked face. He's about to speak
when he looks up, directly into Rat's face, a pistol
pointed at him. Dumbstruck the Engineer watches as Rat
indicates silence, then points to the small American Flag
on his shoulder.
The Engineer looks around, seeing other faces, staring
at him, weapons pointed.
Rat gestures to the panel, then upwards towards the cockpit, as if to say, "Hurry up."
The Engineer turns back, throwing a switch, replaces the
fuse, then restores the power to the fuse. Again, Rat
gestures for silence, offering the "okay" sign. The
Engineer numbly nods his understanding and moves back to
the ladder. He looks up into the cockpit, Ali standing
above, shining a flashlight on him. The Engineer climbs
the ladder.

Cappy has been strapped to a blackboard made from a bulkhead panel. Cahill, looking pale and stunned, watches
with Grant as Rat and Charlie hold Cappy's head as Baker
places a makeshift cervical collar of foam insulation
around Cappy's neck. Baker then carefully tapes Cappy's
head and shoulders to the blackboard. Cappy closes his
eyes, resting.
A silence descends on the tiny room.
CHARLIE
(quietly)
What about Travis, the others?
CAHILL
(numb)
The plane depressurized. At this
altitude,, the airframe would
have collapsed, like an egg shell.
They couldn't have...
The team is silent, stunned by the reality of their
situation.
BAKER
Now what? We've got no radio,

Cahill turns to them, panic filling his face.
CAHILL
We have to negotiate with them.
Tell them they know about their
plot, they'll never let them reach
the United States. It's our only
chance.
Rat, assessing their situation, speaks up.
RAT
I'm in charge, Cahill. Sit down
and shut up.
(beat)
There's only one thing we can do.
Take over the plane, let them know
we're in command and then land it
some place safe. As planned.
CAHILL
Look at you. There's nothing
left. You've got no chance.
We're the only ones who know
they aren't going to make it.
They have to listen...
Rat reaches out, grabbing Cahill by the shirt, yanking
him forward, nose to nose.
RAT
(coolly)
Get a grip, Cahill.
(beat)
We're all in the this together,
so just hang with us and do what
you're told. Now sit your ass
down and stay put.
Stunned but under control, Cahill nods, Rat releasing
him.
Silence settles over the room, the men now realizing
there is but one choice facing them.

Okay.

RAT
What's left of the gear?

BAKER
Not much. No radio, scanners,
sleep agent, only half the weapons.
We've got fiber optic probes and
mikes, infra-red goggles, bomb
kit. That's it.
RAT
And no one to fly the plane.
What's our time frame?
Baker consults a Plexiglass card, three analog watches
indicating elapsed time; time on board; time to fail
safe, the sweep hands moving at steady, unstoppable
speed.
BAKER
Unless a change in speed and
course, we've got three hours
and forty-eight minutes.
RAT
All right. We figure out where
they are, how to hit 'em.
He points to the power control boxes on the bulkheads.
RAT
Power for lights, everything is
right here. We blow the lights,
use infra-red to hit 'em hard
while they're still surprised.

Let's get one thing straight,
Captain. You're still along as
an advisor. Stick with the
interpreting. When I need your
opinion, you'll know it.
GRANT
It's more complicated than chain
of command. Finding that bomb
is just as important, maybe more,
than taking over this plane.
Think about it.
From his stretcher, Cappy calls out.
CAPPY
He's right. Got to know if
there's a bomb.

Could be a pressure switch, timer.
Try to land the plane, change

Carefully pushing aside the bulkhead, Rat, gun in hand,
enters the galley. Seeing the blanket on the floor, he
pulls it back, finding the dead attendant. He replaces
the blanket, going to the elevator door, carefully
opening it. Seeing that the lift is above him on the
main cabin level, he begins to cut the rivet heads from
the floor using his shears.

Removing the ceramic bit, Baker inserts into one of the
two holes he has drilled a spike microphone and into the

Fran enters and begins preparing coffee. She removes a
packet of coffee from a drawer, dumping the old coffee
filter in the trash. She searches for a new filter, and
finding none, reaches to an overhead cabinet, opening it.
As she does, Ali's coat, hung over the aprons, falls to
the floor. As she bends to pick it up, a folded map falls
to the floor. Fran can see that it is an aeronautical
navigation map, part of the Washington, D.C. area exposed.
Cautiously Fran opens the map, seeing an air corridor
approaching the Washington airport where the White House
and other government buildings are located, heavily
circled in red marker, the notation: "2,000 feet," in
handwriting.
She studies the map and then carefully refolds it,
replacing it in the inside pocket. As she stands, Ali
walks into the room. Fran looks at the coat.
FRAN
I'm sorry. It fell when I opened
the cabinet.

ALI
It's important they remain calm.
Is there anything they need?

No. They just want this to be

ALI
Soon enough. A few more hours. I
will share something with you, but
it must remain between us.

When we land... in London. We
will be releasing the women and
children.
Fran stares at him, knowing this is a lie.
FRAN
That would be very kind.
He studies at her a long moment, then removes his hand
from the gun, folding the coat.
ALI
I'm keeping you from your work.
He turns and leaves. Fran stares ahead, her hands
trembling. She knows something horrible is going to
happen with this highjacking and she has to do something.
But what? She sees the empty clipboard where the manifest
had been, thinks, and then removes from her apron her
ballpoint pen.

We MOVE ACROSS the tops of baggage containers, barely two
feet of clearance overhead. Tiny lights have been
clipped to the ceiling, illuminating the darkened room
with red light.
We ARRIVE at a container, opened up like a soup can,
baggage strewn everywhere. Overhead lights illuminate
the open container as if it were the crater at Tycho in
2001. Inside is Rat and Charlie. Charlie examines something in the container with his detector.
CHARLIE
Almost missed it. Reading was
less than one part in two million.
Inside we see a dismantled wooden packing crate, revealing
a three-tiered object, at the bottom of which are two
rows of double-ended bottles, two feet long, six inches
in diameter, stacked two deep, a total of 12 bottles.
The surface of the bottles is a shiny, metallic material,
like mirrored sunglasses. Strapped to the canisters
with stainless steel bands, is a black metal box, two
feet high.

Behind him the DOOR EXPLODES OPEN, the Marshal dropping
the paper into the toilet...

get going, I've got work to do.
Grant pats Cahill on the shoulder. He moves over the
cargo containers towards the bomb where Cappy lies,
Cahill reluctantly following.
GRANT
All right, Cappy. Walk him
through it. Call me if you need
any help.
Grant leaves.
CAPPY
Don't worry, Cahill, this is just
like playing with Leggos, but more
exciting. Bring that bomb kit
over here and let's get started.
Cahill slides the bomb kit into position.
CAPPY
First things first. Looks like
that black cover is just a lead
shield. See if you can lift it
off... But, Cahill, everything
real easy, okay?
Grant carefully releases the four spring-latches at the
base of the cover. He removes the fiber-optic probe and
then gently lifts the cover, revealing the bomb in its
entirety.

INT. 747 COCKPIT - DAY
With the Terrorist Guard now downstairs, the Flight
Engineer is trying to tell the disbelieving pilots

GRANT
How you doing?

INT. BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

126

Cahill is huddled over the bomb, Cappy's bomb-kit open
beside him, an electronic detector attached to the wires
near the barometric switch.
A mirror, taken from a vanity case, has been attached
to Cappy's stretcher by an aluminum pole, somewhat like
a rear-view mirror. From his position, Cappy can
supervise Cahill's work on the bomb.
CAHILL
(to mike)
Uh, okay, I guess. We're ready to
start.
(to Cappy)
Cappy. The meter indicates 15 oms.
CAPPY
Okay, that's good. Looks like it's
in parallel and isolated. Go ahead
and complete the by-pass.
Cahill attaches the end of an alligator clip to the right
side of the switch, completing a by-pass loop of the unit.
127

INT. ELEVATOR - COACH LEVEL - DAY

127

FROM ABOVE, we see the floor of the elevator pushed
upward, revealing Rat in the lower galley.
With the
skill of a gymnast he carefully wedges his way upward
into the elevator, holding his body against the wall as
he closes the floor panel.
Holding tight to the wall, he carefully peers out the
elevator window, seeing Fran, her back to him, working at
the galley.

Fran catches sight of a movement, reflected in the
polished surface of the stainless steel wall. Startled,
she turns and before Rat can duck, their eyes meet, a
look of total shock registering on her face. The flag is
visible on Rat's shoulder as he puts his finger to his
lips.
Suddenly Fran hears SOMEONE APPROACHING from behind, Ali
appearing. A moment's hesitation and then she turns,
grabbing a coffee urn and a cup. Putting her back to the
elevator window, she offers Ali a cup of coffee. He
stares at her suspiciously and then accepts the coffee.

Ali sips the coffee, studying Fran. He's very uneasy
about something but he can't put his finger on it.
Finally he moves on.
Fran looks around her, and then cautiously shoots a
glance inside the elevator. It's empty. We FOLLOW her
gaze UPWARDS to the overhead panels.

INT. OVERHEAD SECTION - DAY

Rat continues on, spider-walking along the support beams,
reaching up to clip in to the trolley cable when his foot
hits a patch of grease, his foot flying out from under him.
In one cat-like movement, Rat flips his position, catching
himself spread-eagled over the lower support beams,
directly over the plastic ceiling panels for the main
cabin. Sweat drips from his face as he carefully regains
his position.
132

INT. MAIN CABIN AREA - DAY

Fran studies the ceiling, half-expecting the commando
seen earlier to come crashing through to the floor. She

unaware of the disturbance she has just heard.

INT. OVERHEAD SECTION - DAY
As Rat, moving down the cable, approaching the forwardmost section of the plane, Charlie's voice cuts in.
CHARLIE (V.O.)

I'm in position, mid-cabin.
They're all over the place. I can
take two, maybe three. I'm good,
but I ain't that good. We need

He moves on, pulling himself along the cable towards the
forward section.

Grant wipes the sweat from his brow and taking a pair of
clippers from Cahill, moves his hand into the heart of
the bomb.
CAPPY
Cahill, could you adjust the
mirror? I want to take a better
look at this thing.
(Cahill adjusts
mirror)
That's better. Now, clip the
wires on either side. Don't
touch anything else.
Cahill places the cutter around the wire. He hesitates
and then, clips the wire, watching the om meter, the
needle darting slightly and then holding on: 15 oms.
Relieved, he clips the second wire.
Good work.

CAPPY
That should do it.

Relieved, Cahill sits back, keying his com-unit.
CAHILL

From the plane, a MECHANIC emerges, descending the stairs,
the name on his coveralls reading: Reggie. He addresses
the three men in a heavy Cockney accent.

INT. GATWICK AIRPORT - VIP LOUNGE - DAY
Inside a commercial aviation building, now serving as a
heavily guarded holding room for Jaffa. Soldiers and
security men are everywhere. Seated on a couch, in a
darkened side of the room, is Jaffa, wearing a bellychain and handcuffs. The U.S. AMBASSADOR to England
is speaking to Jaffa, two marine guards standing
nearby.
AMBASSADOR
... If they will divert to Gander
Air Force Base, Newfoundland, the
United States will guarantee the
safe passage of Ali and his men
back to the Middle East.
(beat)
Otherwise, he will never be allowed
to reach the shores of the United
States.
Jaffa studies the Ambassador appraisingly. He may be in
chains but beginning to relish the power attending his
new found importance. He smiles, assuming a diplomatic
air.
JAFFA

shotgun, the size of a flare gun.
RAT
There's just too many of them,
Captain. We need another gun.
Grant looks at the weapon.
GRANT
It's been years since I even
handled a gun...
RAT
Don't worry, with this you can't
miss. One guy on station just
above us. I'll cue you, you'll
have the element of surprise.
Rat grabs the escape handle to the hatch in one hand,
holding the weapon tight to his chest in the other.

Hold it tight, like this. Push
up hard, two steps up the ladder,
aim straight at his chest and fire.
Don't think, just shoot.

What the quard can't see is her expression as she taps the

A Newsweek, a cover shot of a group of U.S. soldiers in
camouflage, weapons, the banner-line reading: "HOW MUCH
LONGER."
The Marshal looks up, Fran looking hard at the picture
and then mouthing the words: "They're here."
She moves on, leaving the Marshal to stare at the picture
in bewilderment. They're here?

In Cahill's hand is a laser-knife, the size of a fountain

him. Cahill touches the trigger and the beam changes
intensity, the wire suddenly vaporizing, leaving the bare
wire underneath exposed.
That's good.

CAPPY
Now clip in.

Cahill wipes the sweat from his brow, his shirt soaked in
perspiration. At his side is a small black box, taken
from the bomb kit. At one end of the box are a series
of ports for electrical connections. Several wires lead
from the ports to the bomb, clipped in to wires in
various components.
Here goes...

CAHILL
With trembling hands, he attaches another wire to a relay

uncontrollably. He stops.

Cahill opens his eyes. His hand has stopped shaking. He
moves forward, cutting through the wires with the laser.

nearly obscured from view.
Fran stares at the computer, slowly looking up into the
alarmed eyes of the dark-complected man at the window.
The Guard pulls Fran to her feet, examining the pill vial,

The flashing light on the phone is becoming more urgent.
Quietly, Fran rises and lifts the phone from its cradle,
the Terrorist Guard still with his back to her. Her crew

GRANT (V.O.)
(filtered; urgent)
I need your help. The lower galley.
Do exactly as I say. Turn around
and enter the elevator. The lives
of everyone on this plane depend
upon what you do. Right now.
She quietly hangs up the phone and turns, looking into
the eyes of her frightened crew mates. She looks at the
elevator a few steps away.
With a determined look she moves forward, opening the
door and stepping inside.

She moves to the opposite bulkhead, pulling down the
jumpseat.
The MOTORS WHINE again as the elevator begins to lower.
The door opens and the Terrorist emerges. Seeing Fran
sitting across from him, he raises his weapon to fire.
A voice from behind calls out:
Hey!

GRANT (O.S.)
Startled, the Terrorist turns, facing Grant, aiming a .22
silenced pistol at him. The Terrorist starts to move and
Grant FIRES, TWICE, two tiny red holes appearing in the
Terrorist's head. He falls to the floor in a heap. Grant
is stunned, momentarily overcome by what he has just done.
Fran stares back at him, realizing this is not a coldblooded killer. He looks at her as if asking for help
and then kneels, stripping the Terrorist of his clothes.
He looks at Fran.
GRANT
The man in 148... we're going to
stop him.
FRAN
What do you want me to do?
He stares at her, fear in his eyes.

Kaplan and his team are watching the situation map, showing the 747's position, relative to the U.S. coast-line,
the F-14's tracking the jet, and a flashing, fail-safe
line, indicating that the 747 has already crossed the
point where it was determined it must be destroyed. The
elapsed time clock indicates six minutes remaining on the
additional ten minutes.
MAJOR-GENERAL
They'll be starting their descent

DCI
At thirty-five thousand feet our
loses would be minimal. Every

death toll from fallout will
increase dramatically.

I pray you've made the right
decision.
Kaplan continues to stare at the situation map.
As he does, we PAN DOWN TO the table, to the open folder,
the one previously given to Kaplan by the Arab diplomat.
We SLOWLY PUSH IN ON a photograph of a man, early fifties,
fair complextion, balding, with cold, intense eyes. It
is a face we have never seen before, certainly not the
man in 148-B.

Grant emerges from the elevator, pushing Fran as if she
were his prisoner. Holding the automatic weapon in his
left hand as a shield across his face, we see that in
his right hand he is holding the .22 Beretta, flat
against her back.
GRANT
(whisper)
Just keep walking. Eyes straight
ahead. When I push you, hit the
floor and stay down.
Fran moves forward, her face frozen with fear. They
enter the aisle, moving towards the man at the window,
his head barely visible some ten rows away. On the
other side of the cabin, the Terrorist Guard sees them,
but as he can only view Grant from the rear, he continues
on his patrol.
Grant focuses his attention on the man, now seven rows
away. But he fails to see the Terrorist on patrol in
the next section aft, moving AWAY FROM us and towards
the work station.

We RACK FOCUS OVER the gunsights of the pistol INTO the

touches the trigger and then, stops...
Grant stares at the man, seeing him for the first time,
focusing on his eyes, the trembling lip and the unmistakable fear and utter confusion of an innocent man.
Grant spins back to the aisle, meeting Fran's stunned
expression.
GRANT
It's not him...
Grant reaches across the seats, grabbing the computer,
yanking it towards him. As he does, the computer smashes
into the seat back, the battery pack splitting open, a
flood of glittering diamonds, cascading over Grant's leg
and onto the floor.
Grant drops the computer, his eyes whipping across the

In the next section aft, alerted by the commotion, the
Terrorist Guard has moved through the work station and
seeing Grant's face in profile, raises his weapon to fire,
Grant still unaware of his presence.
Suddenly, the Air Marshal springs like a jack-in-the-box
from his seat, a .357 revolver held in combat stance.
Grant reacts, raising his weapon...
AIR MARSHAL
(shouting)
Behind you!
The Marshal FIRES, the terrorist guard ripped off his
feet, slammed into the seats, but FIRING back as he falls,
the Marshal hit, spinning, dropping. Chaos spreads
through the passengers, Grant still probing, searching the
faces before him. Suddenly his eyes make contact and lock
onto a face, a man seated in an aisle seat on the opposite
side of the plane and several rows forward...

We CRASH ZOOM IN ON the face, the face of the man on the

GRANT
Suddenly, like a flushed quail, the man panics, reaching
for something wedged between his jacket and the seat. But
his fingers fumble the object, which falls to the floor.
GRANT
Everybody, down!
As the man lurches to the floor, Grant FIRES, the BULLET
EXPLODING into the headrest. Grant plants his foot on
an armrest and in a wild, crawling scramble across the
center section seats, races desperately to beat the man
to the detonator.
On the floor, the sleeper, with trembling hands, flips
open the lid to a six-inch square calculator-like device,
rapidly punching in a four-digit code.
Grant, in a last desperate lunge, goes airborne in SLOW

as the sleeper's finger touches the detonation switch!

knocked sideways against the seats, his finger closing

BURST which rakes across the cabin, SHATTERING TWO
WINDOWS.

his hand moving a fraction of an inch further, but shaking
so hard he's in danger of knocking the strip from the

With a final effort, Grant knees the Terrorist in the
groin, twice, ripping the weapon free, using it to
bludgeon the Terrorist to the floor. Grant falls as well,
the weapon flying from his hands, lodging under a seat.
Grant, exhausted, nearly sick, struggles to his feet and
turns. Facing him is Ali Hassan, his face wild and
crazed. He raises his weapon, leveling it at Grant...
But his eyes go wide in shock as several SHOTS RING OUT.
Blood spurts from Hassan's mouth as he turns and falls,
face down.
Standing behind him is Fran, Grant's .22 automatic in
her hand. She looks at the gun, her hand beginning to
tremble.
Grant takes the weapon, bending to pick up Ali Hassan's
weapon as well. As Grant rolls over the body...
Ali laughs, a grenade in his hand. He pulls the pin.
Instinctively, Grant lunges, his hand grabbing Ali's,
holding it and the grenade handle closed.
A desperate struggle ensues, Ali fighting to release the
grenade, Grant to keep control of Ali's hand while trying
to subdue him. As they slam against the outer bulkhead,
Grant looks up, seeing an emergency exit door. Wrestling
himself into position, Grant kicks upward with all of his
strength, the release handle for the door flying, the
door pivoting outward as the emergency slide, in an
explosion of air, extends...
Grant breaks free, shoving Ali backwards. As Ali flies
out the door, making a desperate grab for the slide, he
drops the grenade, spoon flying, the grenade wedging in

Ali, arms entangled in a safety line, is ripped to the
end of the slide, flapping wildly in the wind.

CLOSE ON Grant's finger as he releases the computer key,
the audible CLICK intensified. We GO TO Grant's face.
He breathes deeply, the first relaxed breath in many
hours. He closes the case and puts his head back, closing
his eyes. The mission is over.
He gets to his feet, walking down the now empty aircraft.
Reaching the doorway, he steps outside, inhaling deeply
the cold night air. At the bottom of the ramp, Fran is
waiting.

747, still majestic despite the gaping holes in its side.
He turns to Fran.

Let's get out of here.
END CREDITS ROLL and we:
FADE OUT.
