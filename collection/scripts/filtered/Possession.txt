A WOMAN'S VOICE speaks, softly, whispering:
CHRISTABEL (V.O.)
`There was once a little tailor, a
good and unremarkable man,
journeying through a forest. And as
he advanced into the dark...
SLOW FADE UP TO:
EXT. FAIRY TALE FOREST - DAY/NIGHT
Moonlight. A magical forest of trees. Diamond shards of
blue light on wrinkled, wormy roots. Over the mossy gorse,
steps -A little TAILOR, with scissors, needles and thread hanging
from his belt. A glass key round his neck. And a tall,
grey hound beside him. He sees ahead -A giant stone, where a crack opens up. The Tailor peers
inside. And squeezes down inside a dark tunnel. Which
leads out into -INT. STONE CHAMBER - DAY/NIGHT
A shimmering hall of phosphorescent light. The Tailor sees
a tall glass dome; and a shining glass coffin, on a velvet
pall, surrounded by moths and butterflies.
The Tailor peers inside the glass dome, sees -A miniature castle, with windows and battlements.
FROM POV - INSIDE GLASS COFFIN
The Tailor peers in, to see: a sleeping PRINCESS, her
breath ruffling her golden hair. In her hands: a box, like
a green ice egg.
BACK TO SCENE
The Tailor -- takes his glass key, slips it into the lock.

to bend and kiss her perfect cheek,
because he knew this was what he
must do...'
And kisses the Princess.

She opens her eyes, full of

PRINCESS
You must be the one I have been
waiting for. You must be the
prince.
TAILOR
No, you are mistaken. I am a

me alive.
The Princess laughs. And the sound of her laughter SHATTERS
the GLASS COFFIN into splinters. And on the box, CLOSE IN
and -REVEREND (V.O.)
`... I am the resurrection and the
life,' said Jesus. `He that
believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live...'
SLOW FADE UP TO a silvery BLACK AND WHITE -EXT. CEMETERY (LONDON) - DAY (1888)
The box lies in the hands of a widow, MRS. ELLEN ASH, in
front of a mausoleum. It's a dripping November day, sun low
in the sky.
Ellen lifts back her veil to kiss the box. Which she places
inside -- a wrought iron vault. Its doors close.
REVEREND
Let the body and soul of Randolph
Henry Ash lie in eternal peace,
mourned by his sorrowing widow
Ellen...
PULL BACK to see Ellen and mourners, men in black hats and
cloaks like silk-clad ravens round an Egyptian-style vaulted
tomb. Ellen focuses on the box behind a metal grille. HOLD
ON -- the box.
As before our eyes, the box and tomb rapidly -(CONTINUED)

Age a hundred years. Roses wither and die. Moss, weeds,
leaves, briars, tendrils of undergrowth push and coil 'round
the grille.

time...
And as a wind blows leaves, FADE UP TO -EXT. LONDON STREETS (BLOOMSBURY) - DAY (PRESENT)
The spinning wheel of a bicycle. The spokes blur in
a constant motion, giving an illusion of stillness.
As -Suddenly VIVID COLOR and SHRIEK of CAR HORNS -A young man weaves perilously 'round a worm of traffic. In
anorak and cycle clips, ROLAND MICHELL, thirtyish, dodges

bicycle panniers. Heads through a side entrance into!-INT. BRITISH MUSEUM - DAY
Roland walks down a long corridor, leading through to an
ECHOING domed hall. He pauses by a party of TEACHER and
school-kids in front of a statue of an eminent Victorian:
Randolph Henry Ash.
CLOSEUP - STATUE
Roland stares fondly up at the stern features of Ash gazing
lifelessly out over the kids' bored faces.
BACK TO SCENE
TEACHER
... Poet, philosopher, naturalist,
statesman, Randolph Henry Ash was
one of our most eminent literary
heroes...

glorious jewels of our literary

Who stare amusedly at Roland's nerdy appearance, cycling
helmet still on. He slips unnoticed down a side stair-well,
entering -INT. BRITISH MUSEUM BASEMENT - ASH FACTORY - DAY
Through a door marked, "Ash Institute: Director Professor
James Blackadder." This is the "Ash Factory": A basement
of corridors, in institutional grot. Strip lighting,
peeling paint-work.
PAOLA, a fifty-something secretary with moth-like glasses,
glances up at Roland.
PAOLA
'Morning, Roland. Blackadder's in a
panic. Mortimer Cropper has landed.
ROLAND
Oh, God. Did Blackadder finish my
reference? I asked him weeks ago.
PAOLA
I reminded him. But you know what
he's like when Cropper's in town.
ROLAND
I must talk to Blackadder. He knows
since he gave that job to Fergus...
Accident?

PAOLA

Notices his ruined trousers, on her way to the photocopier.
ROLAND
(hadn't noticed before)
Oh... my bicycle, I suppose.

Roland puts down his panniers, squeezes past Paola into the
pantry. He flicks on the kettle. Looks for his coffee mug.
ROLAND
... Who's been using my mug?
As he unscrews the coffee jar, waiting for the kettle to
boil, he turns to see at the door, a grey-haired woman,
staring at him.
BEATRICE
If you have a minute, Roland...
This is Dr. BEATRICE NEST, doyenne of Ellen Ash studies and
Keeper of the Ash Museum, an eccentric spinsterish scholar.
ROLAND
Actually, Beatrice, I was about to
get started on those Ash
footnotes!--!
BEATRICE
It's important. It's about Ellen...
Ominous silence. Roland registers Beatrice's insistence.
She disappears down the hall. Roland has to follow her into
INT. MUSEUM - ASH FACTORY - BEATRICE'S ROOM - DAY
A musty cavern of cardboard boxes and yellowing papers.
Behind them, almost bricked in, sits Beatrice. Who flings a
letter over to Roland.
BEATRICE
I can't bear it. Another letter
from that impossible woman, Leonora
Stern. She wants a piece from me
for some ghastly new journal about
Ellen Ash's sexual relations -With... Ash?
With anyone.

ROLAND
You protect Ellen from questionable
suitors, Beatrice. I've always
admired that.
BEATRICE
Ellen was a faithful wife. And I'm
faithful to her. She needs
protection. I'm the only one now
who cares...
NOISES in the corridor. Two academics poke their noses in.
One, his rival, a trendy young lecturer, FERGUS WOLF; the
other, a bluff elderly Scottish professor, JAMES BLACKADDER,
Roland's boss.
Hi, Roland.

Still here?

Blackadder

BLACKADDER
Ah, Roland... I want you at the
London Library. Come along,
Cropper's in town for the auction...
Blackadder whisks Roland out from the room.
INT. MUSEUM - ASH FACTORY CORRIDORS - DAY
They walk down the corridor with Fergus, Blackadder putting
on his coat.
ROLAND
I feel sorry for poor Beatrice.
Even the feminists hate her now for
championing a dull wife -BLACKADDER
(exasperated)
Beatrice Nest and her bloody letters
of Ellen Ash are completely
irrelevant to modern scholarship.

BLACKADDER (CONT'D)
She's wasted twenty-five years
looking up every recipe for
gooseberry jam and jaunt to
Broadstairs. That's what I get for
hiring a Ph.D from...

... New Zealand.
FERGUS
The old witch. She's the best
keeper of the Ash Museum you'll find
-BLACKADDER
Yes. Like Ellen, Beatrice is best
behind closed doors...
Blackadder and Fergus swoop off. Roland watches them go,
turns 'round to see -- Beatrice scurry back into her room
like a crab. Obviously overheard their comments. Roland
sighs -CUT TO:

clips, Roland swerves through noisy traffic, heading for -EXT. LONDON LIBRARY (ST. JAMES'S SQUARE) - DAY (PRESENT)
An elegant London square. Roland cycles in as leaves blow
from a tall tree towards a vast Victorian library, where
people leave by stone steps, armfuls of books. As Roland
parks his bike -Some LEAVES float away, tumble towards a skylight on the
library roof TAPPING like birds trying to enter, as -INT. LONDON LIBRARY - HALL - DAY
Roland enters the shabby hall. Bespectacled scholars
shuffle around in a silent hum. Roland seems suddenly "at
home." All around him, wasted lifetimes devoted to books...

INT. LONDON LIBRARY - STACKS - DAY
Roland navigates like a mole accustomed to the dark through
a maze of metal shelves. Hidden stairs and tiny corridors
like a Piranesi prison, books piled high: dark, dusty,
infinite...
Roland seems to know his way, even in the dark...
INT. LONDON LIBRARY - BASEMENT - RARE BOOKS DEPARTMENT DAY
Zig-zagging through a labyrinth of books, Roland emerges
down in the basement. He knocks at a door marked "Rare
Books 5." No reply, so he enters -A musty room like a pharaoh's tomb, a high window casting
light into a cell of vellum and leather. Roland puts files
down.
ROLAND
My name's Dr. Michell, Roland
Michell. You have a copy of Donne's
poetry for me. An 1858 edition.
A pebble-glassed LIBRARIAN emerges, crooked as his tottering
piles of books. Slightly deaf, he takes his time.
LIBRARIAN
You ordered it through Professor
Blackadder over at the Ash
Institute?
ROLAND
Correct. I'm working on the
Complete Works edition with him.
LIBRARIAN
I didn't know Ash was an admirer of
Donne?
ROLAND
He quoted one of Donne's poems on
his deathbed. I'm checking
references in the Nineteenth Century
editions... just to be sure.
The Librarian finds Roland's book, bound with tape. He
wipes away black dust, hands it over. Roland sits down,
cracks pages apart.

LIBRARIAN
Doesn't look like it's been touched
for a while. I'll check...
Flicking through, Roland sees notes scrawled in the margins.
CLOSEUP - HANDWRITING
BACK TO SCENE
It intrigues him.
ROLAND
Someone's scrawled notes all over
the margins.
LIBRARIAN
Hm...? Well... it's never been
called for, as far as I know...
(checks file cards, as
Roland reads)
Odd... According to our records,
this edition was bequeathed to us by
Ash's widow, Ellen.
ROLAND
You mean this copy belonged to Ash
himself? Someone must have
consulted it before now.
LIBRARIAN
Seems it was lost in our filing
system...
Intrigued, Roland goes back to cutting leaves. With great
delicacy he cuts open a set of pages, suddenly two old
letters fall to the floor. Roland bends down to pick them
up -LIBRARIAN
(rambling on)
`... Devil and Demonology, Dogs,
Domestic Servants and... Donne...'
(beat)
You can lose anything in here. I
found a set of false teeth once...
Roland isn't listening. Dazzled by a thin shaft of
sunlight, Roland starts to read. On yellowing PAPER, a
sound of a PEN SCRATCHING.

And Ash's voice -- deep, intimate -- OVER:
ASH (V.O.)
`... Dear madam, Excuse this letter
to a stranger. Yet since our
pleasant and unexpected conversation
at Crabb Robinson's party, I have
thought of nothing else...'
On hearing Ash's voice, Roland turns the letters over. Like
a spell, the voice stops. Roland stares hard at the
letters, then looks back at the Librarian. Concealing the
letters from view.
Warily, Roland turns the letters over again. As Roland
reads the next passage, his expression changes to wonder.
ASH (V.O.)
`... I feel, I know with a certainty
that cannot be mistaken, that you
and I must speak again...'
He reads on, silently. Then turns the letters over again.
He folds back the book to the front paper: A signature
"Randolph Henry Ash." Roland pulls the letter up beside the
signature -ROLAND
Incredible...
CLOSEUP - LETTER/SIGNATURE
A match.

Like a great poker hand, Roland can't believe his luck.
Suddenly alive, confused, palpitating, he looks 'round.
Hm...?

his whole life converges in a single moment:
truth or lie, a simple "Yes" or "No":

Time stops,
Life or death,

Guiltily, Roland slides the letters into his copy of
Poems of R.H. Ash. And slips the book beneath his arm, as A loud KNOCKING sound CARRIES OVER from -AUCTIONEER (V.O.)
... Sold once... sold twice...
INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE (LONDON) - DAY
A hammer bangs on a gavel as an AUCTIONEER closes a deal.
In a panelled room, a crowd of buyers sit waiting, some
poised on phones, others with catalogues: Victorian
Literary Memorabilia.
AUCTIONEER
Sold for a hundred and twenty-five
thousand guineas...
The tall, handsome buyer, acknowledges the Auctioneer:
MORTIMER CROPPER, U.S. scholar, collector, master of the Ash
universe. Nearby, the elderly LORD ASH, and his wastrel
son, HILDEBRAND.
AUCTIONEER
... Letters and memorabilia of
Randolph Henry Ash, including
wedding rings belonging to the poet
and his wife... to Professor
Cropper.
Behind him, Blackadder and Fergus Wolf exchange glances.
Cropper acknowledges Blackadder, turns to Lord Ash.
CROPPER
We can rest easy, Lord Ash. The
wedding rings are secured for the
Ash Collection.
LORD ASH
You beat the Japanese again?
CROPPER
Of course, sir. We have very ample
funds.
LORD ASH
(repeating vaguely)
Very ample funds...
Lord Ash smiles.

Cropper comments to Hildebrand.

CROPPER
Pleased to see your father so happy.
HILDEBRAND
Money always excites him.
CROPPER
Then we should go. No more buried
treasure here. Your father's very
frail.
HILDEBRAND
But not frail enough.
Envy in his voice, as Cropper collects the rings. He wheels
Lord Ash's chair to the exit. Blackadder and Fergus gossip.
FERGUS
You have to hand it to Cropper,
repackaging Ash as a New Victorian.
All moral rigor and family values.
Pure opportunism!-BLACKADDER
Now Newsweek picked it up, the old
goat thinks he'll get a Pulitzer for
his book. Hideous...
(beat)
But I wouldn't trust anyone, faced
with Cropper's loot...
Blackadder rushes up to Cropper.
BLACKADDER
Congratulations, Professor Cropper.
CROPPER
Ah, Professor... Dr. Wolf... Look at
these rings. Wonderful things...
He proudly holds up the rings before them.

All look on.

CROPPER
I remember when my father would
amuse himself by placing the
treasures of his own collection in
my sweaty paw...
(MORE)

CROPPER (CONT'D)
(stroking his palm;
sensuously)
... `Here, Morty, my boy,' he would
say. `Here is history to hold in
your hand.' Priceless...
BLACKADDER
Surely a strain even for your
budget.
Effortlessly superior, Cropper smiles condescendingly.
CROPPER
At the Cropper Foundation, we don't
have a budget. Just a check book.
Blackadder, Fergus watch him wheel Lord Ash out.
EXT. ROLAND'S FLAT (STOKE NEWINGTON) - SPINNING BICYCLE

Roland rides up the lanes of rundown Stoke Newington.
Outside a tall Victorian house, Roland stops, brings his
bicycle up steps. Opens his doors, and enters -INT. ROLAND'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Locking his bicycle in the hall, he picks up a pile of mail.
And wearily goes down the stairs into the basement.
INT. ROLAND'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Portraits of Randolph Henry Ash stare down at a kitchen
table. CATS gather, MIAOWING for food, as -VAL, his long-time girl friend, sets down before Roland a
plate of lamb and ratatouille. It's reheated, and like

ROLAND
Shall I get a bottle of wine?

Roland dutifully picks at the meat.

I expect they didn't.
ROLAND

he'll think it's important -VAL
I expect he will.
Roland sees the bad mood.

Like a storm gathering strength.

There are no jobs. And if there

together old Ash's world picture.
Only where does that leave you, old

And how are you ever going to afford

Roland stares, stricken by Val's show of temper.

Something's upset you, hasn't it?
VAL
Seems a reasonable deduction.

DREAM - EXT. HOUSE - CRABB ROBINSON PARTY
(BLACK & WHITE) - DAY
As Ash escorts Ellen into the house, he carries on through a
party, inside a conservatory of Oriental plants which
conceal guests playing blind man's bluff. Ash sees a WOMAN,
head turned away.
ON that look -ASH (V.O.)
`... Since our pleasant and
unexpected conversation at Crabb
Robinson's party, I have thought of
nothing else...'
Ash is drawn towards the Woman -- FREEZE ON his expression,
his features turn as if to stone, as -END OF DREAM.
INT. UNIVERSITY OF LONDON LIBRARY - AT DESK - NEXT DAY
Crisp pages of a yellowing volume. Roland reads the journal
of Crabb Robinson. An entry under 1858.
CRABB ROBINSON (V.O.)
`... June 18, 1858. My breakfast
party went off very well indeed. I
had with me: Mr. Bagehot, Mr. Ash,
Mrs. Jameson... Professor Spear,
Mrs. Lees, Miss La Motte and her
friend Miss Glover, the last
somewhat taciturn...'
Roland locks up, scribbles a note:
He dreamily sees --

"Christabel La Motte."

FLASHBACK - EXT. CRABB ROBINSON'S HOME (RUSSELL
SQUARE) (BLACK & WHITE) - DAY (1858)
In the conservatory, Ash, as before, walking towards a
Woman, turned away from him (and us).

The host, CRABB ROBINSON, a mustachioed aesthete, observes
his guests.
CRABB ROBINSON (V.O.)
`... Ash had never met Miss La
Motte, who spoke more forcefully
than I expected. She is
surprisingly handsome when
animated...'
In BLACK AND WHITE we see as distant shadows -- Ash with a
Woman -- Christabel La Motte -- and behind her, another
Woman -- BLANCHE GLOVER, an attractive, but less confident
artist.
CRABB ROBINSON (V.O.)
`... We all discussed with Mrs. Lees
her claim to have conversed with the
spirit of Charlotte Bronte... Mr.
Ash appealed to Miss La Motte on the
question of visions and second
sight; she declined to express an
opinion, answering only with a Mona
Lisa smile.'
From Ash and Christabel's smile:

Rapturous, intense...

He takes his slip of paper to -INT. UNIVERSITY OF LONDON LIBRARY - INDEX - DAY

ROLAND
I don't. I never heard of her until
now.

Why did you laugh?
FERGUS
You're looking for an involuntary
expert. There are two people in the
world who know all about Christabel

Stern from Tallahassee. The real
expert is Doctor Maud Bailey at
Lincoln. Cropper and I met them
both in Paris. A conference on

They've got Christabel's papers

On the phone you said you found a
connection between Randolph and Ash

ROLAND
I found a draft of a letter in one
of Ash's books. I thought it might

A love letter, I think.

Hard to believe. Where's your

As Roland flicks to June 1858, her writing is decorated with
pretty drawings, slowly merging into swirling, macabre
images.
BLANCHE (V.O.)
`... June 18, 1858. We went out to
breakfast at Mr. Crabb Robinson's

-FLASHBACK - EXT. CRABB ROBINSON'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE)

In a garden conservatory, Ash moves towards a beautiful
woman, back turned away from him. Behind her, as Ash draws
closer is -A woman, we now recognize as -- BLANCHE GLOVER.
BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... The Princess was much admired
and rightly...'
Ash is intercepted by HELLA LEES, a spiritualist. Who
introduces the beautiful woman: CHRISTABEL LA MOTTE, a
beguiling pre-Raphaelite brunette.
BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... She professed to like Mr. Ash's
poem Ragnarok greatly. Which
naturally flattered him...'
Christabel returns Ash's smile. Modestly flirtatious, she
is drawn into his orbit, staring deep into his eyes.
BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... This famous poet would have
been much surprised to know my true
opinion...'

Blanche watches Ash walk with Christabel away from her.
BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... But I smiled and nodded as best
I might, keeping my thoughts to
myself.
(beat)
I desired to be at home.'
Blanche holds in her hand a book, with an embossed gilded
dove on its cover. Then -INTERCUT WITH:
ROLAND
Checking the clock, flips through yellowing pages of
Blanche's journal, filled with portraits of Christabel.
BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... My Princess is much exercised
about a long letter which arrived
today, which she did not show me,
but smiles over, and caught up and
folded away...'
Slowly her portraits change into macabre drawings of
serpents and goblins. Roland returns to a page he's
skimmed:
BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... Letters, letters letters...'
INT. BLANCHE & CHRISTABEL'S HOUSE (1858) - DUSK
In the hallway, a pile of letters. Christabel picks them
up, heads upstairs. Followed at a distance, by Blanche:
Her face brooding and suspicious. As Christabel drops a
letter -Blanche picks it up, goes to the door, confronts her with
it. Christabel runs upstairs, sobbing...
BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... Not for me. You need not hurry
them away...'
INSIDE HER ROOM
Christabel hides letters in her sewing basket, folds them
under handkerchieves. Outside, through the keyhole -(CONTINUED)

BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... I am no sneak, no Governess.
From that fate you rescued me, my
Princess, as I shall rescue you from
yours...'
Blanche spies in.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - IN IRIS
Her eye large, unblinking. Blanche moves back, stares out
the window. The panes frame her face. A storm is
beginning. By candlelight -BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... Now we have a prowler...'
Blanche sees tree shadows move across windows. RAIN and
WIND HOWL outside. WINDOW FRAMES RATTLE, Blanche's anger
mounts. As branches scrape over windows -BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... I hear him out there. A wolf
at the door...'
Blanche watches as from outside something BANGS against a
door. A low moan of CRACKING WOOD. A latch is BATTERED
until ready to give. In a reflection, Blanche sees -BLANCHE (V.O.)
'... This peeping Tom has put his
eye to our walls. Now he peers
shamelessly in...'
A man's face -- Ash -- BOOM! A sudden GUST OF WIND.
Windows and shutters are blown in -- rain pours through. A
silhouette -- a face like Ash. Then the WINDOW BURSTS open
-Splinters of glass fly towards Blanche -SMASH CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Silence. Dusk has turned to night. Beneath an isolated
pool of overhead light, Roland looks up from the diary into
darkness. Among the shelves, a shadow stirs. From the
darkness -MAUD
Did you find anything?

Maud steps into the light.
I think so.

Stunned, Roland closes the book.

ROLAND

Alone together in the deserted library. Unexpectedly
intimate, even erotic. Maud perches on a desk.
ROLAND
Do you know about this prowler
Blanche was so worried about? The
wolf at the door?
MAUD
You think it may have been Ash? You
saw her drawings. Blanche had a
vivid imagination.
On the desk, Roland and Maud flick through Blanche's macabre
drawings of labial flowers and serpents' tongues.
ROLAND
And was jealous.
MAUD
Possibly. If Christabel was her
lover. Lovers do get jealous, don't
they?
ROLAND
What happened to Blanche?
MAUD
She drowned in the Thames, shortly
after completing this book.
Suicide. Christabel was distraught.
It was all very sad.

But it's getting late.

Sorry, not tonight.

ROLAND
I found these. They're in Ash's
handwriting.
MAUD
You're sure they're authentic?
ROLAND
I've checked. They're dated June
19, 1858.
MAUD
The day after Crabb Robinson's
party.
ROLAND
Precisely. If I can find something
definite, they could change our
whole idea of Ash.
(beat)
And perhaps of Christabel.
Maud's pulse quickens. She finishes, looks up, regaining
her composure. Senses their importance.
ROLAND
I haven't shown them to anyone else.
No one else knows they exist. I
found them in a book in the London
Library.
MAUD
You stole them -- ?
ROLAND
I don't think they're mine, or
anything. But they're not Cropper's
or Blackadder's or Lord Ash's
either. Don't you see? My Ash
lived a quiet and exemplary married
life. Now, suddenly...

A love letter to an unknown woman.
As Roland ties himself in knots, Maud is coolly accusatory.
MAUD
I suppose they might represent a
considerable academic scoop. For
you.

ROLAND
Well, I wanted to be the one who
does the work...
(realizes her
insult)
... Wait a minute -- it wasn't like
that.
MAUD
I'm sorry. I'd never have the nerve
to do that. Steal them...
ROLAND
It was an impulse. For the first
time, I felt Ash was alive in those
letters. It was incredible. That's
why I need you to find out the truth
about Ash and Christabel -MAUD
You know Cropper funds the center.
If he finds out -He won't.

ROLAND
If you don't tell him.

MAUD
I can't let you Xerox Blanche's
diary. The spine won't stand it.
Maybe you could copy it out. I need
to think.
ROLAND
You can't throw me out.
MAUD
Can I book you a guest room?
ROLAND
I don't have any money.
MAUD
I thought you were working for
Blackadder.
ROLAND
Part-time. I also wash dishes in a
restaurant.
Maud mulls it over.

MAUD
You'd better come back to my place.
(beat)
You can sleep on my sofa.
Roland looks at the diary. The traces of the faded brown
writing. As Maud's hand rests close by.
INT. MAUD'S FLAT - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
Outside in the hall, Maud collects bedding, plays back an
ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE from Cropper, as in her sitting
room -Photographers from Leonora, letters from the Cropper
Foundation. An illustrated book has been left open for him
on her desk.
MAUD (O.S.)
I found something for you. A first
edition of Christabel's poem, The
Fairy Melusina that Blanche
illustrated...
ROLAND
Can I read it?
MAUD (O.S.)
Yes. It's very beautiful. Critics
still dismiss her poetry. But I
always found it strange and
powerful. There's one passage about
a woman who'd give anything for a
child, even a hedgehog, and duly
gives birth to a monster...
Roland looks at the macabre illustration.

As Maud enters.

ROLAND
I think Blanche is sorry for the
hedgehog.
MAUD
... Is she?
(impressed by Roland's
insight, Maud
examines a picture)
Yes, maybe you're right. Leonora
thought it was related to
Frankenstein, the product of Mary
Shelley's horror of birth -(CONTINUED)

ROLAND
Thanks. I'll read it. Perhaps
it'll help me sleep...

mistake)

Maud throws him blankets.

CHRISTABEL (V.O.)
'... A draggled knight came riding
through the trees,
Behind him fear, before him

The knight hears a song from a hollow chamber: Inside a
glass coffin, bound by silver chains and sapphire ropes,
lies a fairy princess in white silk. She holds a goblet up
to the Knight:
KNIGHT (V.O.)
'... What I shall become, I know
not.
But I crave a place of rest,
A draught of water, for I choke
on dust...'
The Knight pulls back thorny briars, steps into the mossy
hollow. He shatters the glass coffin, magically exploding
into shimmering splinters. The Knight lets the liquid drop
on his tongue, and -(CONTINUED)

'... All one long look consumed
his soul
Into desire beyond the reach of
hope,
Beyond the touch of doubt or
despair,
So that he was one thing, and all
he was --'
As the Knight kisses her, her golden hair wraps itself
around him -- silver chains and emerald ropes bind his
limbs, cut through his armor -- from her mouth a serpent's
tongue darts out -Plucks his eyeballs from behind his chain mail visor.

In the basement, Blanche's diary lies open. Shafts of
moonlight on a deserted hall. A breeze blows, ruffling
pages, past strange drawings of flying doves, as -Past an aisle of desks, walks a shadowy figure, humming a

Roland gives her a final look:

Maud exits, shuts the door behind her. Roland kneels down

Why did you have her picture?
MAUD

She was my great-great-grandmother.
ROLAND
So that's why you're so interested
in Christabel. The family

No. Christabel was so unhappy. I

avoided her. But her poetry always
drew me back. This is where
Christabel died.
Roland looks at the tombstone. In white stone, a female
saint curves round a humble tomb: Christabel La Motte 18251890.

She died alone?

Christabel never married. She had
no children. She spent her last
years living with Sophie and her
husband over at Seal Court.

As wind and rain blow across the saintly figure. Roland

sees glints of silver -- a person in a wheelchair, in
difficulty.
Look.

To Maud's annoyance, Roland heads off up the hill.

of a lady in a wheelchair: silk scarves, hat and boots:

In the old main bedroom, Roland -- in old jumpers -- makes
up an armchair as a bed. Bitterly cold. As they talk, Maud
gets undressed, behind a screen.
MAUD
You didn't have to stay the night.
ROLAND
Lady Joan wanted us to. They think
we're a couple. Besides, they'll
let us look at Christabel's room
tomorrow.

I could have come back on my own.
ROLAND
You're stuck with me now. You'd
never have got in here without me.
MAUD
That doesn't mean I'm grateful.
Turn around...
Roland dutifully snuggles into the armchair, as Maud emerges
from behind the screen in her bedtime outfit: a sugar-pink
winceyette nightdress over long johns, knitted mittens,
Arran sweater.
ROLAND
Then I'll have to tell Sir George
how you and Leonora are such good

interested...

MAUD
You wouldn't do that...

Of course I would. Leonora must
have really offended him.

handwriting. He can hardly speak -ROLAND
(reading the
letter)
'... Dear Miss La Motte, Excuse this
letter to a stranger. It was a
great pleasure to talk to you at
dear Crabbe's breakfast party. May
I hope you too enjoyed our talk -and may I have the pleasure of
calling on you...?'
(to Maud)
.. And the answer? Did she answer?
Maud takes a letter, carefully unfolds it.
MAUD
(reading the
letter)
The next day. '... Dear Mr. Ash, I
am a creature of my Pen, my Pen is
the best of me, and I enclose a
Poem, in earnest of my great
goodwill towards you...'
Go on.

ROLAND
Please...

Maud holds up the letter.
No.

About to read, then --

MAUD
It wouldn't be right.

Excuse me?

ROLAND

MAUD
You should read Ash's letters.

But why?

I'll

ROLAND

MAUD
Those are the poets that interest
each of us -ROLAND
But they're writing to one
another!-(CONTINUED)

MAUD
That's not the point. How can I be
expected to remember Christabel's
words -- ?
ROLAND
But if they're love letters, don't
you want to hear what he wrote to
her?
MAUD
Roland, please. This is not the
time for your theories -Maud freezes him with a glance. They settle on the floor,
both take their respective piles. And sit there, opening
letters in silence. Roland opens his, reads a little -then stares at Maud. Who produces from her pockets a pencil
and some index cards.
ROLAND
What are you doing?
MAUD
I have some cards. I need to record
her observations. It's a system I
use at the center -ROLAND
This is ridiculous -MAUD
I have to be methodical. We can
cross-refer later. Just because
you're unprepared -ROLAND
Unprepared -- ? It's the middle of
the night. I want to get a sense of
what happened to them, how they felt
-MAUD
Roland, you're a scholar. There's
no need to get carried away.
Maud goes back to reading. Coldly hostile, she doesn't look
up. Roland picks up his letters, starts reading. Silence.
Their senses are drawn into the words, until -(CONTINUED)

ROLAND (V.O.)
(from the letter)
'... Dear Miss La Motte, You
encourage me more by your permission
to write again, than by your wish
not to be seen. Perhaps you will
tell me about your Fairy Melusina
poem...'
Roland stops reading. He looks across at Maud.
with concentration, making neat notes.

Who frowns

ROLAND
Sorry to interrupt...
(as Maud looks up)
Was Christabel still living in
Richmond when she wrote The Fairy
Melusina?
MAUD

Yes.

ROLAND
With Blanche...?
(as Maud nods)
Hmmm...
MAUD
Why do you ask?
ROLAND
Ash seems to have written to
Christabel about her poem. At some
length...
Oh...?
Yes.

MAUD

ROLAND
Quite interesting...

Roland lets it drop.
May I look?

But Maud's curiosity is piqued.
MAUD

ROLAND
A quick glance.
Maud peers over, sees the reference.

Looks up.

MAUD
What did he say?

ROLAND
I don't know. I'm just in the
middle...
Of course.

MAUD
Maybe you could...

ROLAND
Read it aloud?
MAUD
Just the reference to her poem -Of course.

ROLAND
If you insist...

As Roland starts to read aloud:

The postman walking up to their door, carrying the letter
clearly in view. He pops it through the letter box,!as!-ROLAND (V.O.)

From the front window, Christabel watches him go.

She --

upstairs, unaware of Blanche emerging from downstairs.
ASH (V.O.)

my eyes never see your person. When
I write, then I know... Your friend,

Then pauses,

MAUD
I can't go on. My hands are
trembling.
ROLAND
Let me find it for you.
(fiddles among
the letters)
It's the next day. They were
writing every day.
Roland selects the right datemark, pulls out the faded
letter, hands it to Maud.
ROLAND
Do you want to read it?
MAUD
Just this one...
Who trembles as she opens it up.
she reads --

She looks up at Roland, as

MAUD
'... My dear friend, how shall I
answer? Your inspiration means so
much to me. Yet I feel I cannot
continue our correspondence.
Blanche and I have made a pact,
chosen a way of life. I cannot
choose to break it...'
Roland watches Maud reading, his eyes over her face in the
candlelight. Sensing their deep immersion in this love
story.
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
FLASHBACK (BLACK AND WHITE) - EXT. RICHMOND STREETS NIGHT
A rainstorm. Up the hill, Christabel and Blanche walk,
followed at a distance by FOOTSTEPS. Outside their house,
Blanche pauses, turns suspiciously. She sees nobody. They
enter their house -(CONTINUED)

CHRISTABEL (V.O.)
'... You will say you are no threat
to that. I know the threat is
there. Perhaps it would be better
if we ceased to correspond...'
INT. BLANCHE AND CHRISTABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The WIND HOWLS. A storm blows. From inside, Blanche looks
out from behind shutters. The night of "the Prowler"...
CHRISTABEL (V.O.)
'... The world would not look well
upon such letters between a woman
and a married man -- even if that
man were a great and wise poet.
Your friend, Christabel La Motte...'
Down the street, stands a man in black cloak and umbrella,
next to a hansom cab. Windswept, lashed by rain, reveal -Ash, eyes fixed upon the house. Through trees on the
window: Blanche.
CRASH -- !!

The WINDOW SMASHES, SPLINTERS --

ASH (V.O.)
'... I cannot forgive myself.
I have no designs on your freedom.
I know too well the unhappiness a
lack of freedom can bring. This
must be your choice. And yet...'
EXT. RICHMOND HOUSE - DAY
A postman arrives, puts the letter into the letterbox.
ASH (V.O.)
'... Our inspiration is so rare, so
special, I cannot think it better if
we ceased to correspond...'
INT. RICHMOND HOUSE - DAY
THROUGH the letterbox, the postman's letter falls to the
floor. It lies on the hallway, like an evil omen.

ASH (V.O.)
'... I shall send you the manuscript
of my new poem, with the ink barely
dry, inspired by the thought of
you... Ever yours most truly...'
Christabel picks up the letter, only to reveal -- Blanche
upstairs behind her. She swoops down, snatches the letter,
takes out pages of handwritten poetry. Christabel tries to
retrieve -A struggle. Blanche throws off Christabel's hand, who
recoils. Blanche takes the poem, holds it up in front of
her -CHRISTABEL (V.O.)
'... I dare not write more. Your
poem is lost. I cannot be sure any
further letter of yours will reach
me...'
Christabel walks upstairs, enters her room, closes the door.
CHRISTABEL (V.O.)
'... And shall I give up? No, I
will not. If it is possible for you
to walk in Richmond Park at eleven,
I shall be there...'
Out of the window, Christabel sees Blanche leave the house.
BLANCHE'S POV
She looks back up at Christabel, like a princess in the
tower. Blanche clutches the letters in her cloak, hurries
away.
END OF FLASHBACK.
INT. ATTIC - CHRISTABEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Maud looks up at Roland, faces by lantern light, surrounded
by letters. Roland opens up another, hands it to Maud, who
pauses. Gently touches his hand, listening to the WIND
HOWLING -MAUD
They're here with us now.

Roland looks into her eyes. Maud picks up a letter, opens
it. In Christabel's handwriting, the words seem
terrifyingly real:

'... This is a moment of madness.
You have summoned me out of my tower
-- and out of my wits. I did not
think you would come...'
The WIND HOWLS, and with a ROLL of THUNDER -FLASHBACK - EXT. RICHMOND PARK - DAY (1858)
Black clouds. A LIGHTNING STORM ROLLS. Lost in a silver
forest, his horse tethered nearby, Christabel turns towards
Ash. His eyes on hers, her pale face trembling, she holds
out her hand to him.
ASH (V.O.)
'... And then it was my madness.
For in that moment, I could take
your hand... or not. Do the deed,
or turn back forever. I was able to
choose either path...'
Ash reaches out, takes her hand, gloved.

Puts it to his

ASH (V.O.)
'... And now only the one.'
The moment of contact is too much. Christabel watches as
Ash takes her glove, slowly unpeels it. Lets it lie limply,
then -Kisses her hand. A moment of perfect stillness. And in
that moment, for the first time, we hear Christabel's voice:
CHRISTABEL
What are we to do?
Ash and Christabel stare into one another's eyes.
ON ASH
ASH (V.O.)
'... There is a fire within us which
must burn...

INT. ASH'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - DAY (1858)
By candlelight inside his study, Ash sits with his books,
composing a letter to Christabel. In the b.g. -ASH (V.O.)
'... I had a plan to go away to
Yorkshire. There are reservations
for two. I beseech you to accompany
me.
(beat)
I shall wait at noon. St. Agnes's
Church.'
Ellen hovers like a ghost, peering out of the window. She
looks out to raindrops on the windowpane. A servant removes
Ash's bag, Ash kisses Ellen upon the cheek. And heads
downstairs.
EXT. ASH'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - DAY
A driver waits, luggage and gear on a carriage. Ash gives a
letter for Christabel to a messenger. Who races off. The
horses set off, Ash in the back. A CLOCK CHIMES. One, two,
three...
ASH (V.O.)
'... I write in haste. I fear your
answer -- I know not whether to
depart or no...'
Besides Ash's carriage, another black carriage pulls up with
a white crest. Then as Blanche steps out -INT. ST. AGNES'S CHURCH - DAY (1858)
At the back of the knave, Ash kneels in prayer. He hears
the CLOCK STRIKE TWELVE. Ash turns, sees an outside door
open slowly. Daylight comes into darkness. The candles
flutter as -MAUD (V.O.)
Did she go with him...?
INT. SEAL COURT - CHRISTABEL'S ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)
Dawn. Maud and Roland lie together, surrounded by the
letters.
ROLAND
There's one left.

MAUD
You read it...
Roland picks up a final letter. From Christabel's pile.
reads it in silence, intrigued by its contents.

He

ROLAND
It's from Christabel. She asks Ash
to return all her letters -MAUD
Is there any more?

There must be...

Frustrated, Maud rummages among the letters. Suddenly, a
door opens, Maud and Roland looks up to see -Sir George staring at them.
SIR GEORGE
What in hell's name -- ?
On the floor, letters are fanned out. Dolls lie, ribbons
untied, dresses unravelled. Maud and Roland look up at Sir
George.
ROLAND
Sir... we found letters from Ash and
Christabel -MAUD
This could change everything -Sir George points his hunting gun at them.
Hands up --

SIR GEORGE

EXT./INT. SEAL COURT - HALL/LIVING AREA - DAY (LATER)
Roland stands outside, whistling. Waiting for the taxi.
Inside -- Maud descends the staircase, sees Sir George in
the hall on the telephone. Maud enters -KITCHEN
where the letters lie on a mound of yellowing newspapers.
Lady Joan greets her sympathetically.
MAUD
Once it's known these letters exist,
everyone will be at your door.
Everyone.

LADY JOAN
Oh, dear... Sir George has a fizzing
temper. I'm sorry you have to go.
From outside, the taxi BEEPS its HORN.
Maud.
So am I.

Roland waves to

MAUD

EXT. ST. ETHELREDA'S CHURCH - DAY
VOOM, VOOM -- ! Maud REVS up her CAR outside the church
where they left it. She pulls out past the taxi which
dropped them. Beside her, Roland looks downcast.
ROLAND
They must be worth a fortune.
MAUD
We both had the same instinct. To
play them down. Cropper would love
to get his hands on them. Do you
think we should tell him -- ?
ROLAND
No -- they'd be in New Mexico
tomorrow. He's have to sit on them.
Or his whole theory about Ash would
be blown away -MAUD
Sir George would be a lot richer.
He could mend that house -ROLAND
I don't know why I feel so
possessive about the damned things.
They're not mine.
MAUD
We found them. And they're private.
They're love letters. I'll bet Sir
George will sell them...
A moment passes.

Roland is agitated.

He turns to Maud.

ROLAND
We should make a pact. If one of us
finds out any more, he or she tells
the other, and no one else.

Maud comes to a crossroads. Left to Lincoln, right to the
North. She pauses. Then revs up, sets off. Roland expects
to turn left -- to Lincoln. She turns right.
ROLAND
You went the wrong way.
MAUD
We're not going back to Lincoln.
ROLAND
Where are we heading?
MAUD
Whitby...

We have to find out.

Maud stares at Roland.

FLASHBACK - INT. TRAIN - RAILWAY CARRIAGE (YORKSHIRE) DAY (1859)
Black smoke billows in a hellish cloud, as an iron
juggernaut zooms on, landscape zips past a window at
breakneck speed, as -- in DAZZLING VIVID COLOR -ASH
looks out of a window, with a patch of warm breath. A
gloved hand wipes through the haze to reveal, in the
reflection, Christabel's face in bright sunlight. Both
nervous, they sit opposite one another. Both with books
upon their knees, Ash suddenly looks up. He has been
planning his speech -ASH
Forgive this boldness. What I do
not know is... whether you wish to
travel as my wife. It is a large
step -(CONTINUED)

CHRISTABEL
I want to be with you. I am quite
happy to be called your wife. That
is what I had understood I -- we -had decided.
ASH
You must not regret this.
CHRISTABEL
Of course I shall regret. So will
you, will you not? But that is of
no importance at this time.
Silence. Then from his pocket, a box:
signet ring.

inside, a gold

ASH
I hope you will accept this ring.
CHRISTABEL
My resolution was as strong as
yours.
She produces her own ring, jade with initial "C." They
smile. Ash peels off her glove. He pushes his ring over
hers.
CHRISTABEL
So... it is done.
Ash holds onto her hand. Suddenly with a WHOOSH of smoke
the TRAIN plunges into flickering darkness of a tunnel. Ash
presses her hand to his lips. Shards of sunlight flicker
like a kinematoscope on his face, Ash lets her fingers fall.
Then -- into light again -- Ash turns her leather glove in
his hands, smoothing its soft leather pockets back into
shape like a fetish. Staring at her.
EXT./INT. WHITBY HOTEL - DUSK (1859)
Late sun. A white hotel, perched on a cliff looking out to
sea. As if in a vivid dream -- Ash and Christabel dismount
from a horse-drawn carriage. The hotelier MRS. CAMMISH
organizes the baggage: hatboxes, trunks, collecting boxes,
nets, writing desks. Which are carried upstairs, as -- Ash
and Christabel go to a window. A view over cliffs, of grey
sea.
ASH
There. The German sea.

Like steel,

CHRISTABEL
It reminds me of the Breton coast.
Which is in some sense my home.
It's so changeable. Blue and clear
one day, the next dark and wild.
ASH
(awkwardly)
I -- we -- must go there too. There
are so many places. Even around
here. Such curious northern names.
Ugglebarnby. Jugger Howe. Howl
Moor -CHRISTABEL
On the map, I saw one. The Boggle
Hole.
She starts to laugh.

Ash smiles too.

ASH
The Boggle Hole...
(laughs too)
Do you like the sound of that?
we shall go there.
Ash says it agreeably.

Then

Christabel relaxes a little.

CHRISTABEL
I should like that. Very much.
Outside, a wind blows in from the sea, as -END OF FLASHBACK.

There's a place on the map, the

Maybe we could go -(MORE)

ROLAND (CONT'D)
(off Maud deep
in her book)
Found anything?
MAUD
(looking up)
I've been reading Ash's love poems.
Most love poetry is only talking to
itself. But Ash wasn't. I think he
was talking to her.
To Ellen --

ROLAND

MAUD
No, Christabel.
(beat)
I like them now.
ROLAND
I'm glad you like something about
him.
MAUD
I didn't say I didn't like Ash. I
only thought Christabel wouldn't
like him. I've been trying to
imagine him. Them.
ROLAND
They must have been in an extreme
state. A moment of madness brought
them here, threw their lives up in
the air. Just like us!-MAUD
They were in love.
Of course.

ROLAND
Don't you envy them?

MAUD
I don't know. We never say the word
love, do we. It's always sex. We
see it everywhere. We say we're
driven by desire, but we can't see
it as they did.

ROLAND
Sometimes I feel that the best state
is to be without desire. I have
this image of a clean empty bed in a
clean empty room, where nothing is
asked or to be asked -MAUD
That's what I think about too, when
I'm alone. The same image. An
empty bed in an empty room. All
white.
ROLAND
Exactly the same.

the table. Now a private dining suite, decorated in
Victorian damask finery.
MRS. CAMMISH
Your lady wife is looking a bit
peaky, sir. Not eating her food?
ASH
Soup. Boiled hake and potatoes.
Cutlets and peas. Arrowroot molds
and treacle tart. We have dined
well, Mrs. Cammish.

MRS. CAMMISH
A spot of sea air. That's the tonic
for your wife, sir. I can tell,
she's a chilly mortal -Mrs. Cammish breezily removes her tray, exits. Christabel
smiles politely, as Ash takes out a thin cigarillo from a
silver case.
ASH
Mrs. Cammish is right.

CHRISTABEL
Perhaps it is considered a wifely
pursuit. I think Mrs. Cammish
considers me lacking in wifely
virtues.
Ash lights the cigarillo, takes a lung-full of smoke.
ASH
I care not for such wifely virtue.
(beat)
Will you go up first, my dear?
Christabel stands up, strained but mocking.

She smiles.

CHRISTABEL
If you wish, my dear...
Christabel takes a lit candle, exits. Ash walks to the
window. Enjoys his cigar smoke curling in front of him, the
CRASH of the SEA below, as Mrs. Cammish reappears.
ASH
Do you have a cognac?
MRS. CAMMISH
Nothing French in this house, sir.
ASH
Quite so.

his breath)

No cognac, and no Balzac, neither,

Ash blows a last puff of cigar smoke,

INT. WHITBY HOTEL - HALLWAY AND STAIRS - NIGHT (1859)
Ash walks down a dark hall, past towering plants, elaborate
mosaics, to the stairs. Maids dutifully wax wood, shine
brass.
ASH (V.O.)
`Dear Ellen... Today I made a
curious geological discovery...
Ash mounts stairs, footsteps muffled by carpet. He nears
the top, on his face -- dread and wonder. Ash walks down
the corridor.
ASH (V.O.)
`... Adornments may be made here
from ancient ammoniate fossils,
creatures long dead but not
vanished. They are jet black, with
a special silver lustre. In this
very marvel of science, I now see a
perfect miracle...'
Two chambermaids walk past Ash, curtseying. Ash stubs out
his cigarillo on a brass ashtray. He stands in front of the
room, then opens the door -INT. WHITBY HOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT (1859)
Ash enters a dark, candle-lit room.

On a chair sits a --

Crinoline petticoat like a collapsed cage, all steel hoops
and straps. To one side, a brass bed: Where Christabel
stands, her back to him, arms on the rails, in a corset.
CHRISTABEL
I need some assistance.
Ash moves over to her. His fingers pick up fine, long
laces; unthreads, trembling over boned silk; he fumbles,
drops them.

ASH
I am inexperienced in such matters.
Christabel does not look back. She pulls her hair up to
reveal the nape of her neck, downy hair by candlelight. Ash
sees the swell of her breasts, as he plants...
A kiss upon her bare shoulder.

And with a whisper --

ASH
You are safe with me.
CHRISTABEL
I am not at all safe with you.
(beat)
But I have no desire to be
elsewhere.
Ash unthreads the laces. He feels the curve of her waist,
her hips. Slowly, as she turns to undo his collar stud, she
kisses him on his neck. As in a...
MONTAGE
of buttons and laces -- stockings unrolled -- corset removed
-- candle blown out -UPON BED
Ash embraces her.
CHRISTABEL
Are you afraid?
ASH
Not now... my white lady,
Christabel.
Ash takes her in his arms.

They lie upon the bed.

ASH
Do not fight me...
I must...

A pool of light from a bedside lamp, as Roland murmurs a
poem aloud from a book of Ash's poetry.
ROLAND
`... Or the thundering roar
Of the Ash volcanic,
Thrown from some crater
Of earth-fire within?'
Roland walks over to the bathroom. A heavy, latched door.
He knocks, no reply. Then opens the door -INT. WHITBY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT
The door swings in -- IN SLOW MOTION. Steam gathers in cold
air. Roland nearly falls over a part-naked figure!-Maud in a silken robe, who steadies herself on his shoulder
-Roland throws up a hand, clasps her supple body beneath her
robe -- Maud gasps. An electric current between
them -ROLAND

Roland briefly clutches the silk. He lets it go, as if
stung. He sees her hair -- damp, over bare shoulders and
neck. Beads of water, running down to her breasts.

steam, looking at himself in the mirror -- in which he sees
a blurred figure. He wipes away the steam to see a swirl of
white sheets -FLASHBACK - INT. WHITBY HOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT (1859)
In darkness, Ash awakes. Not beside him. He sees her over
by a windowseat. In a swirl of sheets, he gets up, goes
over. Finds her shaking silently, with tears. He puts out
an arm.
ASH
What is it, my dear?
CHRISTABEL
How can we bear it? For so short a

ASH
We can pretend that we have all the

Would you rather have had nothing at

A breeze wafts through, ruffling her hair, awakening Maud
from her dream to hear Christabel's voice... half-dream,
half-real.
... Admit.

CHRISTABEL (O.S.)
You know me...

In pale dawn light, Maud sees letters scattered over her
table. Then over by the windowseat -Christabel sits looking out, head turned away, hair blowing
in the breeze... through the window: sea spray crash on
rocks: the water resembles flames of fire.
Framed in the window with the ghost, the reflection of the
leaping flames against her face, Maud gets an epiphany -MAUD
Oh my God... Roland.
INT. WHITBY HOTEL - ROLAND'S BEDROOM - DAWN
Roland awakes to KNOCKING at his door. Groggily he gets up,
goes to the door. Opens it to see -- Maud.

My room.

MAUD
Now.

Maud returns swiftly.

Roland steps out warily, wondering.

INT. WHITBY HOTEL - MAUD'S BEDROOM - DAWN
Roland walks into Maud's room. Sees her staring out of the
window. For a moment, he can't see anything. He looks
closer at the window.
I saw her.
Who...?
Christabel.

MAUD
ROLAND
MAUD

Maud moves closer to Roland. Almost touching. As Roland
sees traces of a reflection in the window. He turns to her.
MAUD
All my life, since I was a child,
I've seen her. But never with
anyone else. You saw her, didn't
you...?
ROLAND
I'm not sure what I saw...
MAUD
I saw Blanche that night in Lincoln.
That's why I wanted you to go. I
thought it was a warning.
And now?

ROLAND

MAUD
I don't know. You don't think I'm
crazy -No, never.

ROLAND
Not much, anyway.

ROLAND (CONT'D)
But two crazy people are no more use
than one. We still have no proof.
Now the ghost has vanished, Maud can see out over the beach.
Look.

MAUD
Out there.

Roland squints his eyes. Focuses out in the distance:
waves crash upon rocky caverns, sun scattering light like
flames.
MAUD
You read Christabel's poem about
Melusina -ROLAND
But I never finished it.

ROLAND
Wait. Say it again. Do it, and

Just do it -Now inspired, Roland starts.

Inside his office, Blackadder is hard at work on a footnote
of an Ash poem (Mummy Possesst). He looks up to see:
Fergus. Instinctively, Blackadder puts a hand over his
writing.
FERGUS
I was looking for Roland Michell.
BLACKADDER
He's on holiday. He asked for a few
days off... Never had a holiday

But it may have come to nothing.

INT. ROLAND AND VAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
Val is eating cornflakes. CATS MEOWING. The DOORBELL
RINGS. She goes to answer it. It's Fergus Wolf.
FERGUS
Hello, my dearest. Is Roland in?

No.

VAL
He's gone away for a few days.

FERGUS
What a pity. I need to get in touch
with him rather urgently.
VAL
He hasn't phoned. I don't know when
he's back. I haven't been all that
nice to him.
I see...

FERGUS

VAL
I don't know what you see, Fergus.
You always see a bit more than there
is to see. What's up?
FERGUS
There's something going on I don't
understand. Yet. You don't happen
to know Maud Bailey?
A silence.

Now Val is intrigued.
VAL
I see... He didn't tell me what he
was up to. He knows I'm not
interested. But I did have a phone
number. For emergencies.
FERGUS
This could be an emergency.

EXT. SOHO STREETS (OUTSIDE L'ESCARGOT) - DAY
Outside a restaurant, Mortimer Cropper walks with Hildebrand
Ash down the street. When he hears a voice behind him.
FERGUS
Professor Cropper -(as Cropper and
Hildebrand turn
'round)
Sorry to interrupt. I was curious
if you'd seen Roland Michell
recently...

FERGUS (CONT'D)

something. A connection between Ash
and the poet Christabel La Motte...
Hildebrand and Cropper exchange glances.
CROPPER
How extraordinary. We were just
discussing an enquiry about some
letters up in Lincoln -(giving his full
attention)
You interest me, Dr. Wolf.
Like a cat with the cream, Fergus purrs quietly.

Go away.

Still aims the gun.

SIR GEORGE

CROPPER
Don't shoot. I never trouble the

Randolph Henry Ash. Have you any
idea of how much they would be

Worth?
In money.

In money, Sir George.

Sir George's brow creases with thought.

Roland and Maud at a rocky cavern they glimpsed from the
hotel. Maud with scarf covering her hair, suddenly seeing
Roland in a new light, as she examines the distinctive,
jet-black stones.
MAUD
Look at these. All shiny and black.
No wonder Ash wrote about them.
ROLAND
I wonder if they ever met again...
MAUD
No one knows where Christabel went
when Blanche died. She seems to
have vanished -ROLAND
Then it's hopeless. We still need
to find real proof Ash and
Christabel were here together.

MAUD
That could take weeks...

Will you be sorry to go back now?
Will you?

ROLAND

MAUD
I have the impression both of us
will be sorry.
Maud looks up at Roland. And as the sunlight reflects on
the stones in her hand -DISSOLVE TO:

Christabel are in a cavern aglow with light. Outside, WAVES
CRASH against rocks, as Christabel fills her basket with
jet-black stones. In a playful, light-hearted mood, Ash
nuzzles close to her.
CHRISTABEL
I shall take these home, use them to
prop doors, weigh down the sheets of
my poem!-Affectionately, hands intertwined, she teases him.
ASH
Let me carry them back for you.
CHRISTABEL

I can carry my own burdens.
ASH
Not while I am here!-Ash takes the basket. She relents, then suddenly her mood
shifts. She looks away saddened, as they head out onto the
rocks.
CHRISTABEL
You know that after these few days
together!-ASH
Let us not think of time!-(CONTINUED)

CHRISTABEL
We must part, never look back. It
is inevitable, we both know it!-ASH
I cannot, will not.

I love you!--

CHRISTABEL
You speak to me of love? You have a
wife, sir. Speak to me of her.
In sudden fury, the SEA CRASHES against rocks below. Wind
buffets them. In anguish, words stick in his throat, tears
in his eyes.
ASH
I have a wife... and I love her.
Not as I love you...
(he stops; unable
to go on)
There are good reasons why my love
for you need not hurt her. I know
this must sound bald and lame. It
must be what many men, philandering
men, have said before me. I never
thought to find myself saying such
things. Yet I believe what I have
said to be true. I can never tire

work. Not for any good reason. But

MAUD
I had a relationship like that. We

in the morning. I felt battered.
For no good reason.
Roland sees Maud smiling.

Fiddling with her head scarf.

ROLAND
Tell me!-- Why do you always cover
your hair?
MAUD
It's the wrong color. No one
believes it's natural. At a
conference once I got accused of
trying to please men. So I cut it
off. Now it's grown, I put it away.
ROLAND
You shouldn't. You should let it
out.

Why do you say that?

That's what's so odd.

She puts down her head, shakes it.
ROLAND

All right.

MAUD
That feels better.

A moment between them.
Roland is drawn towards her. But
up to the cliff, Maud sees a familiar figure appear, waving
at them.

CROPPER
Hello, down there!-- !
Roland and Maud swivel 'round to see!-- the urbane
silhouette of Mortimer Cropper, walking towards them in the
sandy cove.
CROPPER
At last. You're a hard pair to
track down!-ROLAND
How did you find us!-- ?
CROPPER
A little detective work. You're
forgetting. I know our dear
Randolph better than any of you.
Congratulations on your discovery...

Tea, anyone...?
Cropper moves up to them, with his shark's grin.
INT. HOTEL - TEA ROOM - DAY
Cropper pours tea for Maud, Roland looks on. Cropper is
charmingly proprietorial, gleeful at his new possessions.
MAUD
At least Sir George and Lady Joan
will get some money -ROLAND
But have you read the letters?
CROPPER
That's not so important. I'll be
sending them back to New Mexico for
safekeeping. Poor Lord Ash found
the news very upsetting. He had a

Maud react)
Hildebrand has stepped in to look
after the Ash estate.
ROLAND
We can't prove it yet. But we think
Ash and Christabel came here.
Together!-(CONTINUED)

CROPPER
Fascinating...
(beat; a grin)
Perhaps. Perhaps not... Of course,
if something did develop between Ash
and Christabel, Maud and I would be
the natural team to do the research.
After all...
(puts a proprietorial
arm around her)
We have a 'special relationship'...
Roland picks up the nuance.

Cropper turns to him.

CROPPER
We already fund Maud's work. And
with what I know about Ash... I
don't think you'll be needed, Dr.
Michell.
Roland sits, saying nothing.

Furious.

CROPPER
Thanks for your time and energy, Dr.
Michell. I'm sure you understand.
ROLAND
I understand.
Roland looks at Maud, like a rabbit in the headlights. Says
nothing. Roland gets up, walks off in disgust. Cropper
stops Maud following. She turns to him.
MAUD
Now you own the letters you can do
what you want -- why do you need me?
CROPPER
My lawyer tells me Ash wrote a note
returning his letters to
Christabel's possession. A legal
technicality -MAUD
You mean the letters could belong to
me?
CROPPER
Open to dispute. But I'd hate to
see you waste money on law suits.
So unnecessary.

Maud pulls her hand away from Cropper.
MAUD
I was worried you were being nice to
me. How silly...

Maud follows Roland up to his room.

She knocks on his door.

enters. Finds Roland flinging his books and papers into a
bag.

Ash sees a halo of electromagnetic force like fire surround

opposite: and recognizes Christabel, who speaks in a

hands wrap around his throat -ASH

raises the wreath in his hands. Mrs. Lees pleads -MRS. LEES

Maud snaps back, answers with a smile. Le Minier buzzes
along the country roads, heading for the nearby small town.

EXT. HOTEL (LA CAP COZ, BRITTANY) - DAY
Rain pours down. Le Minier sets Maud down nearby her hotel
in a provincial seaside town, near a sandy bay and dark sea.
As Maud runs to the entrance, she sees someone sheltering
from the elements. Hunched over, slumped, drenched by rain
-On closer inspection, she sees -- Roland. Shocked at first,
she warms to a smile. As Roland looks up, anorak collar
pulled up. And through the rain, they rush together, throw
arms 'round each other. Then slowly pull apart -ROLAND

INT. HOTEL (LE CAP COZ, BRITTANY) - DAY
In her bedroom, Roland sits, feet in a bowl of steaming
water. He wraps a towel 'round his head, as he and Maud
share their discoveries.
ROLAND
She was there. Christabel was there
at the seance. But Ash was so full
of rage -MAUD
Or grief. He believed Christabel
was responsible for someone's death.
The question is -- `Who?'
ROLAND
Blanche, of course. You said no one
knew where Christabel was when
Blanche committed suicide.
MAUD
Until now. That's what I found from
Leonora's letter. Christabel had
family in Brittany. A young cousin
who wrote a journal. A French
researcher found fragments of poems
by Christabel dated Spring 1860.
This is where she was. Until now,
nobody knew...
Maud takes the towel, rubs Roland's hair dry.

ROLAND
I wish nobody knew where I was.
MAUD
Me too. I've lied shamelessly to
Leonora. I even stole Dr. Le
Minier's address.
ROLAND
All scholars are a bit crazy.
Roland sneezes, blows his nose. He's in a bad way, his
towel like a turban, balanced on his head.
MAUD
Roland, you said Ash came to France.

Suddenly, they freeze. In the lobby of the hotel, they see
-Leonora Stern with Blackadder, canoodling fondly.
Oh, no...

IN LOBBY
Roland and Maud overhear Leonora with Blackadder.
LEONORA
I don't understand why Maud dashed
off without a word. That letter

Perhaps your Roland Michell is some

He's not forceful. It's his major

ROLAND
We don't know it was dead.
MAUD
I can't help thinking... if it

Maybe she meant no one to know what

Ellen closes the window. She walks into the library, a FIRE

At a desk, Ash looks through a microscope: At a dead
butterfly. Its intricate patterns. A pin is poised over
the sample. Yet his mind is on something else. He gets up,
moves behind her. Ellen stops.
ASH
Ellen, I have something I must tell
you.
Ellen turns to him.

Ash pauses, then words tumble out.

ASH
For the last year, I have been in
love with another woman. I could
say it was a sort of madness. A
possession, as by demons. A kind of
blinding. At first it was only
letters -- and then -- in Yorkshire
-- I was not alone -I know.

Ellen looks up at Ash, his proud crest fallen.
How long?
I was told.

ASH
ELLEN
I had a visitor.

Ellen unlocks a drawer. Brings out the original copy of
Ash's poem, in an envelope addressed to "Miss La Motte,
Bethany..."
ELLEN

Certain passages are superior, I
think, to what you now have here.

I sensed a new inspiration. A muse.
As I would care to inspire you, were

Mortimer Cropper was here today.

Beatrice looks at them both.

Very serious.

No. About Ash's funeral. He

Ellen wrote to baffle us.
ROLAND

She wrote so much. To throw us off

She left this scrap of paper in her

propped up on pillows. He is dying.
ASH
Forty-four years with no anger. I
do not think many husbands and wives
can say as much...

It cannot be helped. Do you think,
after death, we continue...?
Ellen bows her head, begins to weep.
ASH
Do not cry. I am not sorry. I have
not -- done nothing, you know. I
have lived.
Ellen sees Ash clutching in his hand a gold pocket watch:
long, plaited chain of gold hair tied around it.

ASH
Do not let me be picked by vultures.
Burn what they should not see...
Ellen unwinds her hair from his hands. A KNOCK at the door.
As she gets up to go, Ash moans deliriously -ASH

an eye, I saw her. I should have
looked after her. How could I? I
could only hurt her...

ELLEN
You saw who? In the summer fields?
You saw who, Randolph?

(after a pause)
I... forgot...
Ash falls back asleep, his hand clutches the watch with the
golden hair which Ellen will also later bury. Ellen goes to

hesitates.
Instead of throwing them on the fire, Ellen walks toward a
box...
ELLEN (V.O.)
`-- My Randolph now is gone.
Tomorrow we will set out together on
his last blind journey...'
She unlocks the box, removes an envelope, addressed to
"Randolph Ash." The broken seal recognizable as
Christabel's: a crest of arms, a shield held up by a
unicorn and centaur.
Ellen goes to the bed-stand: a pocket watch with a plait of
golden hair wrapped around the chain-ring.
ELLEN (V.O.)

Maud.

`Justice will perhaps be done to

BEATRICE
I've asked myself that question all
these years. A scholar's

If Cropper digs it up, he can keep
the truth hidden forever.

So what can we do? We'd need to
catch him in the act -BEATRICE
Or get to the box before him -ROLAND
You mean, break in... to the tomb?

BEATRICE
I know it sounds... barbaric.

Rain starts. The sun is about to rise. Roland and Maud sit
at the graveyard by the mausoleum. On the ground -MAUD

`... And so, "in the calm of mind,
all passion spent," I thank God -if there must be a dragon -- that he
was you.'
The box has been opened, the letter (with crest) sits out of
its envelope, photos in their hands, watch with its braided
lock of golden hair. Roland holds it against Maud's own
hair.
It's her.

ROLAND
May. She was...

MAUD
My great-great-grandmother, yes.
May...
ROLAND
Now I know why they left all this -the clues, the poems, the letters.
They wanted you to know, Maud. They
left them for you.

Holding the old crumpled pictures of May, Maud is overcome.
MAUD
She looks like Christabel.

You can

She looks like you. She looks like
Randolph Henry Ash, too.

So I look like Ash?
A hint of lightness.

Roland smiles, gently touches her

ROLAND
I would never have thought of it.
But yes -- here, at the corner of
the eyebrow -- the edge of the mouth
-MAUD
Now you see it, you'll always see it
-ROLAND
I'll never be free of it.
No.

MAUD
We'll never be free.

Maud smiles too, looks up at Roland, as if for the first
time. Roland reaches out to her, holds her close to him.
ROLAND
Maud... I... love you so much...
The ice queen melts.

Maud buries her face, tears fall.

ROLAND
I just love you. That's how it is.
Maud raises her arms to him, his hands stroke her wet hair,
tracing the curves of her shivering body. As -MAUD
The worst possible way then.
They pull away for an instant.

ROLAND
Yes, total obsession.

The worst...

They move closer. Roland knows her heart is barely
triumphing over her fear. Fighting every inch of the way,
Maud softly brings her lips to his. A heartbeat away from
a...
Long, lingering kiss.

Until --

Maud opens her eyes, looks up slowly. And behind Roland,
sees -- over the brow of the hill, a familiar figure:
Beatrice. Smiling, white hair streaming in the rain.
Roland swivels around, to see -A gathering crowd of sodden, desperate scholars: Beatrice,
Cropper, Hildebrand, Fergus, gloomy; ever Blackadder and
Leonora.
INT. INN (NEAR CEMETERY)
RAIN POURS down. In the bar, around a fireplace, a muddy
crew of scholars, in pajamas and dressing gowns, drink hot
toddies; Blackadder and Leonora hold hands, in love.
Beatrice passes around the letters.
BLACKADDER
How strange for Maud to be descended
from both Ash and Christabel...
FERGUS
Yes. Your lives' work, all in
vain...
CROPPER
No, no. I sensed it all along. The
old Cropper instinct. I knew it was
something vast...
BEATRICE
I can imagine Ellen. She didn't
even read it. Just put it away -BLACKADDER
For Maud. As it turns out. She
preserved it for Maud.
Poor Ash.

He never knew... never

Looking to Leonora, for once speechless, gazing at a damp
letter.
... Wow.

curtains. Maud and Roland by a white bed.

I'm afraid of it, too.
you.

Just like

MAUD
What cowards we are, after all.
(beat)
Kiss me.
ROLAND
That's what I was afraid of.
Behind the white veils, Maud finally kisses Roland, softly
at first, then with all her repressed passion, as they lie
down upon the bed -DOWN BY BED - BOX
And beside it -- the WATCH. With its plait of golden hair,
where we HOLD for a moment. Until, weakly, fitfully, the
sweeping second-hand gasps out a few inexplicable TICKS -enough to let us know -It is alive.
ASH (V.O.)
There are things that happen and
leave no discernible trace, are not
spoken of or written of, as though
such things have never been. Two
people met, on a hot May day, and
never mentioned the meeting...
DISSOLVE TO:

FLASHBACK - EXT. MEADOW (SEAL COURT) - DAY (1868)
The same WATCH, TICKING...
In the hands of a man, walking down a country lane on a hot
May day of bright sunlight and BUZZING INSECTS. Nearby, a
meadow full of flowers, like a Monet: blue cornflowers,
scarlet poppies, a carpet of yellow daisies sway in the
breeze.
Up a lane, walks a bearded man in a black, wide-brimmed hat.
From cool shadows, he stares wistfully out in the distance,
at -- the gothic towers of Seal Court. The old man is hot,
wipes his brow.
As he catches his breath, a nearby CREAKING sound, to and
fro, distracts him. Yet so intense is his stare, he hardly
notices a young GIRL (8), swinging on a gate.
Hello!

GIRL
Are you lost?

The Girl, in blue dress and white pinafore, hums to herself,
making a daisy chain. The man looks down at her: he is
Ash.
ASH
Am I -- ? Oh, hello. Yes... I was
looking up at yonder house. Do you
know it?
That house?
my house.

GIRL
Of course I do.

That's

ASH
(beat)
Is it really?
Suddenly curious, Ash cocks his head towards her, lowers
himself on one knee. A gentle matter-of-fact tenderness.
ASH
Well, you are a very fortunate girl.
(holding out his
hand)
My name is Randolph Ash. How do you
do? May I know yours?
GIRL (MAY)
My name is May Bailey. I have
another name also, but I do not like
it.

ASH
I think I know your mother. You
have a true look of your mother.
MAY
No one else says that.
look like my father.

I think I

ASH
I think you have a look of your
father, too.
Ash puts his arms around her waist, lifts her down to his
side. Mays sits, pulling grass, surrounded by a cloud of
butterflies.
ASH
You seem very happy.
MAY
Oh, yes. I am, I am.
(beat)
Can you make daisy chains?
ASH
I will make you a crown for a May
Queen. But you must give me
something in exchange.
MAY
I haven't got anything to give.
ASH
Oh, just a lock of hair.
remember you by.

To

MAY
Like a fairy story.
Just so.

ASH

Ash hunts in his satchel, takes out a tiny pair of pocket
scissors. And very gently cuts a long lock from her golden
hair.
MAY
Here. I'll plait it for you, to
keep it tidy.
May's fingers set to work, Ash gathers up twigs, ferns,
flowers.

ASH
I'll make you a crown, like a
fairy's child. Or like Proserpine.
Do you know any poetry?
MAY
I have an Aunt Christabel who is
always telling me poems. But I
don't like poetry.
ASH
I am sorry you don't like poetry, as
I am a poet.
MAY
Oh, I like you. You make lovely
things and don't fuss.
ASH
If I wrote down a message, would you
be kind enough to deliver it to your
aunt?
A message?

MAY
What will it say?

ASH
Simply that you met a poet, who was
looking for his fairy goddess, and
who met you instead, and who sends
her his compliments, and will not
disturb her, and is on his way to
fresh woods and pastures anew.
Ash locks into May's eyes. A moment he will remember with
absolute clarity, but which will fade in her memory over the
years. Tiny beetles crawl about their feet.
They go back to working beneath the sun. A man and a girl,
content to share one moment of their lives. As a breeze
floats through, ruffling the leaves around them -DISSOLVE TO:
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Ash stands by the gate, watching May run through the meadow,
note in hand, daisy crown upon her head. Ash winds her
blonde hair-plait around the chain of his watch.

May climbs up a hill towards Seal Court, where her brothers
ambush her. They rough and tumble, falling down the grassy
slope. Her crown falls beneath one brother, is crushed.
Among her things, May picks up her half-embroidered cushion
(the one Maud finds a hundred years on) with verses only
begun. Ash turns away as -HIS NOTE
without May even registering -Flies from her hand, up into the air. Carried by the wind
like a leaf, it floats through the fields. Over the grass,
connected by diamond-threads of light -Over the yellow and purple flowers, up into the branches of
a tree. When a wind blows, RUSTLING LEAVES, seeming to play
music upon them. HOLD ON the tree. SLOW PAN THROUGH TO -END OF FLASHBACK.
EXT. LONDON LIBRARY (ST. JAMES'S SQUARE) - DAY
That same tree. A hundred years later. Now full circle,
growing magically in an elegant square in central London.
As the WIND RUSHES through the branches, in an ancient
harmony -About to pluck from its branches to tap upon a library
window -Leaves, floating like birds.
FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
