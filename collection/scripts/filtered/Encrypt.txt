ENCRYPT
by Richard Taylor
FADE IN:
THE EARTH
spins in mortal turmoil. A vast spinner of clouds the size of
Australia approaches the west coast of North America,
lightning flashing, thunder BELLOWING and CRACKLING. The sky
glows red and purple, angry and crazy. This is the planet
made Gothic by human intervention.
SEATTLE - THE SPACE NEEDLE
is buffeted by hundred-and-fifty-mile-an-hour winds. Plate
glass shatters and explodes.
SAN FRANCISCO - THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
quakes before the raging wind. A giant tsunami surges toward
the great suspension bridge. When it passes, cables have been
wrenched, untwining, and collapse appears imminent.
EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
The city is a swamp, some buildings on dry ground, others
below sea level. Far south and east of its northern cousins,
the full thrust of the storm has not struck Los Angeles yet.
Smoke from open fires trail skyward like ghosts and spread
along the ceiling of the sky even as it bleeds rain
everywhere.
A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL (MANDY)
runs, terrified, down a decayed city street. She clutches
something in her dirt-caked hands, holds it dear to her
breast.
The girl slides around a corner on her bottom, stares back.
GIRL'S POV - THE STREET
seems derelict. A flash of lightning reveals men scurrying
like rats after her.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 2.

RESUME AND FOLLOW MANDY (A MONTAGE)
as she turns and scrambles away. Her pursuers follow her
everywhere — around rusting cars, through an abandoned MTA
bus, and across the rubble of a building that once dispensed
happy meals and toys.
Mandy dives into a burrow beneath piled debris.
One of the men walks directly toward her.
Another scurries, chortling madly, around to her side.
A third man approaches from behind.
Mandy clutches her prize ever-more tightly and prays that
they don't see her.
They do.
The leader lifts Mandy from the debris, her naked legs
dangling from beneath her torn dress.
LEAD RAT
Lookit what I got!
Mandy struggles and screams. Lead Rat covers her mouth.
Limping Rat snatches the prize from her fingers: A dinner
roll, hard as a rock and twice as filthy.
LIMPING RAT
So that's what you're hiding, little
girl? Don't you want to share? You want
to share, right?
Mandy writhes free enough to say:
MANDY
Take it! Take it! Just... leave me alone!
Chortling Rat arrives. His fingers pinch Mandy's leg.
CHORTLING RAT
This little girl's plump.
Lead Rat drops her to the ground, assesses her.
LEAD RAT
You got family, girl... with anything to
trade?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 3.

Mandy understands immediately.
MANDY
Yes! Yes, my daddy's got canned goods.
And gasoline.
Lead Rat thinks about this. The dinner roll lying abandoned
nearby suggests not.
CHORTLING RAT
She'd feed us for a week!
LIMPING RAT
(grinning, of Chortling Rat as
he assesses girl)
I dunno... You still on that diet?
Mandy screams and tries to break away. Lead Rat holds her in
a vise grip.
Chortling Rat kneels beside the little girl.
CHORTLING RAT
(of leader)
I never took you for squeamish.
That settles it. Lead Rat produces a huge switchblade. It
snaps out, steel catching the light.
Mandy screams.
An arrow slams through Lead Rat's neck. He doesn't move, not
believing.
JOHN GARTH (35) STANDS ON A WALL (SCENE),
a hard man with hawk eyes now focused on killing. Even though
he is a warrior, there is something humane about John Garth.
He knows there is no glory to what he is doing. His rock-like
exposed arms hold the bow's tension like the cables of a
suspension bridge, and shake with the load. He releases.
Lead Rat faces death and drops.
Limping Rat is already scurrying away, weapon drawn, when
Garth's second arrow catches him. He drops.
Chortling Rat, whining fearfully, scuttles around debris,
hiding his silhouette. He pulls a nasty looking automatic and
looks up to find a target when an arrow slams into him. He
falls.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 4.

Garth drops to the ground, walks to Mandy, who stands sucking
air like the price is going up.
JOHN GARTH
Your mother's worried.
Mandy shakes her head crazily. Yes, I know.
Garth kneels beside her. Mandy bursts into his arms. He holds
her like a father until her sobs diminish.
GARTH
You shouldn't go out by yourself.
Mandy buries her head in his chest, safe now.
MANDY
But I'm hungry, John.
I know...

GARTH
Garth releases her and steps past to harvest the arrow that
took Lead Rat's life. He takes the switchblade as well.
Mandy scurries to where the dinner roll lies and retrieves
it. She tries to bite into it. Hard as stone.
BESIDE LIMPING RAT'S CORPSE - GARTH
harvests the second arrow, using the switchblade to cut the
arrow out.
Mandy staggers to Garth's side. She looks yearningly at
Limping Rat. Clutching Garth's leg:
MANDY
It would be a waste to just leave them
here.

No.

GARTH
(understanding her meaning)
MANDY
But I'm hungry.
GARTH
You stay here. I have to get my other
arrow.
Garth moves to get the arrow.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 5.

Mandy waits nervously near Limping Rat's corpse. When Garth
returns, he scoops her up and starts walking away.
Looking back from Garth's arms, Mandy's hungry eyes remain on
the corpse.
EXT. SURVIVOR'S CAMP - NIGHT
It's a hovel bandaged with debris. Campfires burn with
constant complaint, sizzling embers and hissing wood once
shaped by hand. Mist clouds everything.
Men and women guard the ramparts, some with guns, some with
bows like Garth's.
A GUARD
Someone's coming.
The men scramble to the walls.
GARTH'S VOICE
(a shout)
John Garth!
A moment later Garth enters the camp with Mandy carried on
his hip.
Mandy's mother rushes to take her into her arms as Garth
drops her.
Mandy!

MANDY'S MOM
MANDY
Look, Mom... I found some bread.
MANDY'S MOM
Where were you?! I've been worried to
death!
GARTH
She's okay. I found her about six blocks
south, near Pico.
Thank you.
It's okay.

MANDY'S MOM
GARTH

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 6.

MANDY
(showing her prize)
Mom! Look, bread!
MANDY'S MOM
You put that away, now. One of the
hunters found meat. We have stew.
Garth turns at this information. Meat?
MANDY
Food?! Mommy, I'm so hungry...
MANDY'S MOM
Come on, sweetheart. I'll get you a bowl.
Garth questions this silently, then turns to head for his
digs.
EXT./INT. GARTH'S DIGS - NIGHT
An often-repaired tent. Garth throws the entry flap back,
enters to find his father, MATTHEW, Garth grown older and
weaker. He lies in a hammock, recovering from a broken leg.
MATTHEW
You're not dead, I see.
Storing his equipment:
GARTH
Not yet. How's the leg?
MATTHEW
I'm hobbling about. Anything happen out
there?
Garth turns to survey his father, pulls three cans of
Campbell's soup from his jacket.
GARTH
I killed six men... three this morning
over these...
(presents the cans)
... three tonight over the Parker girl.
MATTHEW
You found her alive?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 7.

GARTH
Alive. She wouldn't have stayed that way
long... I hear they've got stew. Did
anybody bring you some?
Matthew snorts.
MATTHEW
Rodriguez says he killed a deer. Brought
the meat in already butchered... There
are no deer left in Los Angeles, not even
in the canyons.
Garth understands. Meat. Of the human variety. After a
moment:
GARTH
How 'bout some Campbell's soup? M'M-M'MGood...
(reads labels)
Cream of mushroom... chicken noodle...
and cream of tomato.
MATTHEW
(smacking his lips)
Chicken noodle. I'll stoke the fire.
GARTH
No, dad. I'll take care of it. You stay
off that leg.
Garth pulls his survival knife and begins to open one of the
cans.
DISSOLVE:
INT. GARTH'S DIGS - NIGHT
Garth and Matthew lie asleep after their repast, Matthew in
his hammock, Garth on a bed made of old clothes.
EXT. SURVIVOR'S CAMP - NIGHT
Guards walk lonely beats behind walls of debris.
Suddenly a brilliant light appears in the night sky. A VOICE
from a loudspeaker:
HELICOPTER VOICE
You people in the camp... We're looking
for John Garth.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 8.

ANOTHER ANGLE - HELICOPTER
hovers a hundred yards from the ramparts, its single
directional light bouncing from point to point on the walls.
HELICOPTER VOICE
Is he in there?
EXT. CAMP
Garth exits his digs. His father hobbles after.
A camp citizen climbs to the top of the walls.
CAMP CITIZEN
He's here... What do you want?
HELICOPTER VOICE
We're coming in.
The chopper sets down.
MOMENTS LATER - THREE MEN
enter the camp. Two wear LAPD uniforms, the third a long coat
with a detective badge pinned to a lapel, LAPIERE. He's the
sort of man who becomes a cop because of one perk — power.
One of the uniforms carries a cardboard box marked Peaches.
The camp citizens give them a wide berth. Garth stands one
row back.
LAPIERE
I'm Detective Lieutenant Oscar LaPiere of
the LAPD.
THE CROWD
... he's no cop... no police anymore...
he's lying (etc.)
LAPIERE
Of course there are police left.
(smiling confidently)
We're just like you, trying to survive.
We help when we can.
GARTH
You must be pretty busy... elsewhere.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 9.

Lapiere's steady grin belies the heat of his eyes directed at
Garth.
LAPIERE
Where's John Garth?
GARTH
What do you want with him?
LAPIERE
I've brought him a gift. Are you John
Garth?
GARTH
What gift? Who sent it?
LaPiere allows the question to dangle a moment, then steps
aside and gestures to the cop holding the crate to set it
down.
LAPIERE
Peaches... Name brand, not the store
variety... packed in syrup.
The gasp of camp citizens suggests this might be gold.
GARTH
Who sent it?
LAPIERE
Anton Reich.
Garth kneels beside the cardboard box to check the glue
seals. Not tampered with.
LAPIERE (CONT'D)
I take it you're John Garth?
GARTH
Who's Anton Reich? And what does he want
with me?
Mandy steps through the crowd and kneels beside the box. She
is in awe of it.
LAPIERE
He wants to hire you. He instructed me to
tell you — this is a signing bonus.
GARTH
Signing bonus? Then it's not a gift?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 10.

LAPIERE
Oh no. It's yours. No strings.
Garth considers that, then tears the box open and hands Mandy
a can. She can't suppress her joy. Running to her mother:
MANDY
Mommy! Mommy! Look what I got!
LAPIERE
(continuing with restrained
disapproval)
You can do with it what you will, of
course... Mr. Reich just wants to take a
meeting with you.
Garth removes four cans from the box and gives them to his
father. Taking one can for himself, Garth shoves what remains
of the box into the arms of the camp leader.
GARTH
Share this...
(to LaPiere)
Let's go.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAMP - NIGHT
The helicopter looks shiny new as Garth, LaPiere and the cops
trudge through debris-ridden terrain. Garth uses his survival
knife to open the can of peaches.
GARTH
(of chopper)
I didn't think there were any of those
left.
LAPIERE
You'd be surprised what's left... if you
know the right people.
EXT./INT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
The chopper flies through the rainy night.
Garth pushes the can lid back and drinks thirstily before
lifting a peach slice out and swallowing it whole, like a
bear with a fish just caught from a stream. LaPiere looks on
with amusement. Garth sees his look, offers the can.
LAPIERE
No thank you. I've eaten.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 11.

Garth shrugs, digs out another fish.
EXT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER LANDING PAD - NIGHT
The lights work, even if the sign has been damaged: UCL(A)
M(ed)ICAL CEN(t)ER. The chopper sets down.
Garth, Lapiere and the attending cops exit and make for the
big hospital building as Garth tosses the empty can of
peaches into an empty wire receptacle.
INT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT
Garth, LaPiere and the uniformed cops make their way into the
building, which obviously is no longer in use as a hospital.
Even though it appears abandoned, the lights work.
Garth stops to look around. He hasn't seen electric lights in
months.
GARTH
What's powering these lights?
LAPIERE
(moving him along)
Mr. Reich has his residence on the top
floor.
INT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER TOP FLOOR - NIGHT
An immense open bay. At one end are stacked platform after
platform of canned goods, ammunition, oil, military weaponry
in cases, liquor, medical supplies. At the opposite end, a
mansion in miniature with unblemished furniture, Persian
carpets, drapes over the windows, stands of famous artworks,
paintings, sculpture, and a huge oak desk stolen, certainly,
from a rich man's office.
Men in uniform stand guard beside the elevator door, one
LAPD, the second MTA. One uniform is as good as another,
apparently
The elevator opens. Garth and LaPiere exit, followed by the
two cops.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ANTON REICH
is a man of formidable countenance. 50, he wears clothes that
in better times might be considered obscenely expensive. He

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 12.

is a leader, a manipulator, and a salesman. He approaches
Garth as if welcoming an important client, extending a hand.
REICH
Major Garth, welcome. Anton Reich.
Garth surveys him briefly, the proffered hand, then turns his
gaze to the cops.
REICH (CONT'D)
Don't worry. They're not really police.
They work for me now.
Garth's gaze continues to the flats of canned goods and other
supplies.
REICH (CONT'D)
Are you hungry, Major?
GARTH
Oh no, I just finished dinner. Steak and
lobster, a good chardonnay, and chocolate
mousse for dessert.
REICH
(amused)
Better than my table, I'm afraid. But I
can have my cook whip up something...
Major?
GARTH
I'm not a major.
REICH
No, of course not. Not anymore. Who of us
have titles these days?... Sergeant?
LAPIERE
It's Lieutenant, Mr. Reich.
REICH
Mr. Garth and I will have dinner in the
residence. See to it.
Yes, sir.

LAPIERE
Lapiere turns and moves for the elevator.
REICH
(to cops)
You two may leave as well.
The two cops follow LaPiere.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 13.

Reich takes Garth by the arm, and releases him on Garth's
look.
REICH (CONT'D)
While we're waiting for dinner, can I get
you anything else?
GARTH
Well, Adolph... you can tell me what you
want so I can blow this bunker.
REICH
Adolph... not such a bad fellow after
all, now was he?... I should think simple
logic would answer your question. You
have nothing I could want — except skill.
Obviously, I want to hire you.
GARTH
I'm not for hire.
REICH
Yes, I'm certain that's so. Do you see
that flat of canned goods back there?
Garth looks. A mountain eight feet by eight feet. A fortune.
REICH (CONT'D)
I had it brought up here just so you
could see it. I usually leave food down
in the pantry... In any case, there are
sixty cases of beef stew, sixty of fruit
cocktail, sixty cases of peaches — my
favorite, I usually have peaches for
dessert — sixty cases of deviled ham,
sixty cases of hash, sixty cases of tuna,
sixty cases of... well, I can give you a
manifest.
Garth takes in the vast fortune. He fails to hide his
astonishment.
REICH (CONT'D)
Are you still not for hire, Major Garth?
Garth's silence is answer enough.
REICH (CONT'D)
I thought so...
GARTH
Who do you want me to kill?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 14.

REICH
Kill? Kill?! Killing is easy, Major. What
I want you to do is much harder. Care for
a brandy?
Reich opens a fresh bottle of Courvoisier, almost fills two
snifters, turns to hand one to Garth.
GARTH
stands before one of a dozen paintings, many recognizable,
but not this. It's a map of the earth with a vast storm, not
unlike the Red Spot of Jupiter, swirling across the world.
Reich presents Garth with a brandy.
REICH
You've found my Nilsson. It's
magnificent, isn't it?
Garth takes the brandy, sniffs, and is snatched into
enthralled memories.
REICH (CONT'D)
It's called 'The Blue Spot.' It was
painted right after they discovered the
storm that circles the surface of the
earth, like 'The Red Spot' circles
Jupiter, returning again and again,
wreaking havoc... Nilsson killed himself
right after he completed it.
GARTH
Suicide doesn't exactly distinguish him,
does it?
REICH
No, not at all. So many people have
killed themselves. Still, it's a
magnificent piece. Most of these pieces
you see here I took into protective
custody from the Getty.
GARTH
I thought I recognized some of them.
REICH
Which is why I need you, Major.
GARTH
I told you. I'm not a major anymore.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 15.

REICH
yanks a tarp from a table miniature of an estate.
REICH
Come see this.
Garth reluctantly joins him.
REICH (CONT'D)
Do you recognize it?
GARTH
The Vincent estate.
REICH
Yes. It's located across the four-oh-five
from the Getty, in the Sepulveda Pass.
It's nearly as big, too. Are you familiar
with Vincent?
GARTH
Just that he's rich.
REICH
Was rich. No one's seen him in years.
He's probably dead. Still, his estate
remains operative... You may have
wondered how it is that we have electric
lights here, elevators that work and so
on, when the rest of the city has been
reduced to the stone age. It's because
UCLA has a nuke in the basement. It was
installed for educational purposes, but
it's large enough to supply the entire
facility with power...
Reich searches Garth's eyes for understanding. Finally:
REICH (CONT'D)
Vincent installed a duplicate in his
estate. It's fully automated, powering a
specially designed security system.
Vincent intended to convert his estate
into a museum on his death, but the world
fell apart first. I want you to break in,
Major... break in and shut down Vincent's
nuke, so I can take all of Vincent's art
into protective custody.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 16.

GARTH
(cynical grin)
Protective custody?
REICH
Oh hell, I could call it stealing, but
the truth is, it'll only be in my hands
until I die, and then the next fellow
will come along and protect it.
GARTH
You could say the same thing about
gold...
(eyes drifting toward the
palets of food)
... while other valuables are consumable.
REICH
(smiling)
Yes, that's true... So, what do you say?
The shadows across Garth's eyes hide deep thoughts.
LATER - GARTH AND REICH SIT AT TABLE
enjoying a sumptuous meal. Candlesticks, wine, dishes filled
with ample portions.
Nearby, the table miniature.
REICH
... thing is, the roof is protected by
surface-to-air missiles, SAMs. Anything
that comes within a thousand yards of the
place is blown up.
GARTH
You tried it?
Hm, yes.

REICH
GARTH
Why not assault it from the side?
REICH
The grounds are protected by miniature
battle units — tanks, in reality,
although they were manufactured to look
like dogs.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 17.

GARTH
With just the equipment you have over
there...
(gestures crates across room)
... you could take out something like
that.
REICH
The entrances are made of six inch armor
plate, but we could get past that, too.
It was proven during the middle ages that
any wall may be breached. No, the problem
is, I don't want any of Vincent's
collection damaged.
GARTH
Go in a window, then.
REICH
You make it sound so easy. I hope that it
is. A window, yes. The real problem is
not getting in, but staying alive once
you're there...
(on Garth's look)
I have much of Vincent's security plans.
Some, anyway. He employed a new kind of
controller, a sentient computer system.
GARTH
The computer reasons? Like a human being?
REICH
Here. Let me show you.
Reich removes a notebook computer from a briefcase beside the
table, opens it. A picture of DIANA LOGAN, 28, appears on the
screen. Diana is beautiful, yes, but behind her eyes resides
an incisive mind and a depth of feeling unusual in one so
young.
REICH (CONT'D)
Twenty years ago this woman, Diana Logan,
was dying of cancer. Vincent convinced
her to transfer her consciousness into
his one-of-a-kind mainframe, which he
named EnCrypt. She lives there still,
inside Vincent's mansion... a kind of
apparition within his computer.
Garth studies the face. It reminds him that once flowers
bloomed, that there was hope in the world, that people were
young and beautiful. He closes the notebook lid.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 18.

GARTH
She controls all of the security systems?
REICH
Yes. As well as maintenance and repair.
As I said, the Vincent mansion is fully
automated.
GARTH
Is she programmed to kill?
REICH
Oh yes. If necessary.
GARTH
How do I defeat her... the system, I
mean?
REICH
You defeat each subsystem separately. But
in order to defeat the entire system, you
must shut down the reactor. It's located
in the basement, along with the
supercomputer that controls everything.
Obviously, this area presents the
greatest challenge.
Obviously.

GARTH
REICH
There is one additional thing I haven't
mentioned yet... research that Vincent
was doing... the last copy of which may
be in the computer. I want you to
download it before shutting the system
off.
GARTH
What kind of research?
Reich considers not telling him. He delays, sipping wine,
cutting another bite of meat. Then:
REICH
Vincent was researching weather
control... a way to stop the storms — THE
STORM — and return the earth to its
original weather pattern.
Garth laughs. Redemption? It seems absurd.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 19.

GARTH
You want me to save the world?
Reich smiles too.
REICH
Yes. Could you please?... It's probably
nothing. Vincent is missing and in all
likelihood dead, not an indicator for
success, is it? Still, even if his
research is partially completed...
GARTH
stands and walks to the window. The city lights are fires
consuming furniture and dreams. Reich joins him.
GARTH
The world's dying while you play
potentate inside these walls. Hell, it's
already dead. What you see out there is
nothing more than the death rattle.
REICH
No. What you see out there is a thinning
of the herd. From ten billion people to
maybe a million... a necessary event...
and we who are to survive will need a
return to the old weather cycle... and
art, too, if we are to remain civilized.
Download the data if you can... but shut
down that nuke.
The SOUND of a firefight some distance away.
REICH (CONT'D)
My competitor from the South Bay. She
pushes north with an army twice the size
of mine. She's flush with booty from that
shopping center down there, the biggest
one in the world. It's made her strong...
That's why I'm pulling out, Major,
relocating to the Central Coast after the
storm passes. I want the Vincent estate
before I leave. And I plan to leave the
moment the storm clears. That's how much
time you'll have, two, maybe three days.
After that I blow my way in and take
whatever's not destroyed.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 20.

FOLLOW GARTH AND REICH
as they walk past the palets of food and supplies.
REICH
I want you to have a good night's
sleep... be at your best before you go
in... Is there anything I can get you?
Companionship, maybe?
Garth stops before the eight-by-eight-foot cube of food.
GARTH
I do nothing... until this is delivered
to my camp.
REICH
(laughs)
Half. The rest when you come out.
Garth gestures assent.
REICH (CONT'D)
(calling)
Sergeant LaPiere.
The elevator door opens revealing LaPiere and two former LAPD
cops.
REICH (CONT'D)
Show the Major to his room... then
arrange to have half of this food
delivered to his camp. Tonight.
INT. GARTH'S ROOM - NIGHT
The room is splendidly attired, subtly illuminated. LaPiere
allows Garth in, then closes the door behind him.
Garth begins to remove his clothes.
Movement in the corner of the room. A WOMAN steps out of the
shadows. She is lovely. Her greek gown insinuates that she
possesses nothing else, just this garment. Clearly, this
situation is new to her and she's afraid.
WOMAN
I'm... yours, if you want me.
Garth doesn't know what to say.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 21.

The woman releases the gown and it slips away. The strain of
this, the humiliation, tugs on her expression. She steps up
to Garth, waiting for him to touch her. She will not cry. No.
But the struggle makes the muscles of her face dance with
restrained emotion.
Garth pulls the bedspread from the bed and wraps her in it.
She clutches the garment about herself, thankful. Finally her
brow finds his chest. She sobs. Garth's arms almost close
about her, but he hesitates. After a moment:
GARTH
Who were you?
SLAVE
I was... a CPA.
She looks up. Her intelligent eyes search his.
SLAVE (CONT'D)
Who were you?
The question has many answers. Finally:
GARTH
A civilized man.
THE NEXT MORNING
finds the woman asleep beneath the covers, and Garth waking
above them. He rises from the bed, begins to dress.
THE DOORWAY - LAPIERE
stands just inside, grinning smugly.
LAPIERE
Forget that stuff. We've got new clothes
for you. You can even shower, if you
want.
IN THE SHOWER - GARTH
stands beneath the spray of hot water. The feel of it reminds
him of clean yesterdays.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 22.

LOCKER ROOM - GARTH
exits the shower to find a stack of clothes on a bench, and
new boots beneath it. He dresses.
RESIDENCE - GARTH AND REICH
observe his notebook computer screen.
REICH
Have you faced automated defense systems
before, Major?
GARTH
Many times.
REICH
Then you know that Vincent Industries
supplied much of the world's automated
security and combat systems. He made
everything from sentry dogs, like
these...
INSERT - SCREEN (AND INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)
where the SENTRY DOG lopes onto the screen, then TRANSMORPHS
into an animated blueprint. The animal looks like a large
bulldog.
RESUME GARTH AND REICH
looking at the screen.
REICH
(continuous)
... to more commercial combat platforms.
This particular model can be configured
as a strictly urban, house protection
system, or it can carry weapons. In the
case of Vincent's mansion, the dogs are
fully armed. We tested the perimeter to
find out.
GARTH
(disdainful)
Who went in? LaPiere?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 23.

REICH
No. Unfortunately our man was killed. You
knew Captain Leon Vega of the Army
Rangers?
The name impacts.
GARTH
I trained him...
REICH
Yes. He mentioned you before he died...
Inside the Vincent mansion there are
other platforms, several that were on the
market, and possibly a number that
Vincent was developing but had not yet
finalized. Almost certainly you'll find
the Ghost.
THE GHOST comes up on the screen. It indeed looks like a
ghost, a floating apparition, but it has teeth — weapon
barrels, which are shown when the device TRANSMORPHS into an
animated blueprint.
REICH (CONT'D)
It fires a mini-pulse bolt that can both
stun and kill, depending on the
programming. Other weapon configurations
are possible. Its design was intended to
scare off intruders first, so there is a
mercy factor built in.
GARTH
Mercy factor...
REICH
There are other weapons platform
possibilities. We've listed all that we
know about Vincent Industries equipment
in this notebook computer. Take it with
you. Familiarize yourself with Vincent's
defense mechanisms. My advice, though, is
to expect the unexpected.
Garth closes the notebook, considering what he has got
himself into.
ARMORY - GARTH
marvels at the array of weapons and combat paraphernalia
organized on shelves and attached to walls.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 24.

Reich and LaPiere watch from nearby as the ARMORER brings
what appears to be a metal flak jacket to Garth and fits it
to him.
ARMORER
Have you worn force-field body armor
before, Major?
No.

GARTH
ARMORER
I'm not surprised. It was just introduced
during the last days of the Pentagon...
Now, it's battery operated. This readout...
He places a WATCH-LIKE DEVICE on Garth's wrist.
ARMORER (CONT'D)
... here tells you your count. Generally
speaking, the armor is good for
approximately a hundred rounds of fivepoint-five-six, or seventy-five rounds of
seven-point-six-two. Grenades and pulse
weapons take a toll of anywhere from ten
to a hundred points, depending on the
proximity of impact. You follow?
I follow.

GARTH
ARMORER
Good. Now this is a battery pack.
The armorer straps a BATTERY BELT to Garth's waist.
ARMORER (CONT'D)
It holds twenty additional batteries.
They aren't interconnected for reasons of
shorting out or chain reaction. You
understand? This armor is electrically
operated.
GARTH
I get the concept.
ARMORER
You must change the batteries between
firefights, or whenever a battery becomes
depleted. Some batteries may provide
protection past the hundred mark, but
don't count on it.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 25.

The Armorer takes an M-16 off a table and points it at Garth.
ARMORER (CONT'D)
(to Reich and LaPiere)
Gentlemen, you may wish to stand back.
Glancing rounds will deflect.
Reich and LaPiere retreat five paces.
Garth can't believe he's about to be shot at. He steps
forward...
The Armorer BEGINS FIRING. The ROUNDS HIT GARTH repeatedly
until the magazine empties. EACH ROUND HITTING THE BODY ARMOR
CAUSES IT TO 'FLASH' AS IT REPELS THE FIREPOWER.
The Armorer switches magazines as Garth, angered and
surprised, attempts to march forward again and take the gun
from the Armorer's hands. Garth is again THROWN BACK BY
SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS, and then to the floor.
The Armorer reloads, begins firing again as Garth tries to
get up, finally succeeds, assaults forward toward the Armorer
as he reloads yet another magazine, and begins firing again,
throwing Garth back. Garth topples behind the table.
The Armorer switches to an AK-47.
ARMORER (CONT'D)
Switching to a larger round...
These heavier rounds throw Garth back to the wall. MOST
ROUNDS HIT THE ARMOR, FLATTEN AND SLIDE TO THE FLOOR, WHILE
GLANCING BLOWS DEFLECT LEFT AND RIGHT.
ARMORER (CONT'D)
(shouting over din)
It's advisable that you seek cover when
being fired upon. While armor-deflected
rounds can't penetrate, the concussive
force of the round...
(changes magazine, starts
firing)
... can disorient and in some cases
render the recipient unconscious. I am
avoiding the Major's head area for
demonstration purposes. An enemy won't be
so lenient.
The Armorer finishes his last magazine and puts the AK-47
down.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 26.

Garth rises, shaken, and marches for the Armorer, who raises
a hand, signalling 'Stop.'
ARMORER (CONT'D)
(big smile)
Just kidding.
Garth stops, trying to control his anger.
GARTH
You son-of-a-bitch, you didn't warn me!
ARMORER
Major, you have just taken eighty direct
hits. Under normal circumstances, one
would have been enough to kill you. How
do you feel?
Garth grabs the smaller man and nearly lifts him off his
feet. After a moment:
GARTH
I feel... SWELL.
Garth drops the Armorer and surges past as Reich and LaPiere
share a look of amusement.
INSERT - THE RECHARGER PACK
in the Armorer's hands is tugged open, revealing slots that
accept body armor batteries, and dials for adjusting the
equipment.
INT. THE ARMORY - THE ARMORER (SCENE)
twists the pack for Garth to see.
ARMORER
The pack has its own armor. Don't let it
take direct hits if you want to continue
supplying power to your body armor. The
unit accommodates ten batteries at a
time, and can recharge them from cold to
hot in about an hour. You'll go in with
ten batteries charged in here, plus the
twenty on your belt. Got it?
This time Garth sneers at him and yanks the pack out of his
hands.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 27.

GARTH
How many recharges?
ARMORER
Thirty. Maybe less. Battery technology is
freaky... but you can connect to one-ten
and recharge the batteries directly from
house current, presuming there is house
current.
AT THE SELECTION TABLE - GARTH
stands before a number of rifles and pistols arrayed on the
table. The Armorer, Reich and LaPiere watch from five paces
away.
ARMORER
What do you want?
GARTH
What do you got?
ARMORER
Everything.
GARTH
Then what do you recommend?
ARMORER
Pulse rifle.
He picks up the pulse rifle and throws it to Garth.
ARMORER (CONT'D)
(continuing)
Has the punch of a fifty with almost no
recoil. Uses the same batteries as the
armor, fifty rounds of decreasing
intensity. Has a tendency to start fires.
That could be problematical...
REICH
Choose another gun.
Garth looks at him a moment, then:
GARTH
I'll take it. What else?
ARMORER
I recommend an automatic pistol. Two, if
you don't mind the weight. This Smith &

ARMORER (cont'd)
Wesson is pretty slick. It holds fifty
rounds of five-point-five-six and spits
them out at a rate of five hundred rounds

GARTH
I'll take two. What else?
ARMORER
Grenade launcher —
REICH
Out of the question.
What else?

GARTH
ARMORER
I've got knives... survival... serrated
edge... stiletto...
GARTH
The stiletto and the survival knife. What
else?
ARMORER
I've got some cowboy junk... combat
bow...
Too bulky.

GARTH
ARMORER
(continuous)
... miniature crossbow.
GARTH
Let me see it.
The Armorer removes a metal pen from his shirt pocket,
presses a button. The shaft elongates to four times its
original length, bow arms pop out at one end, a handle at the
other. He places it in Garth's hand.
ARMORER
Carries five shafts inside the tube. No,
wait, you twist the eraser... there.
Garth twists the eraser and five tiny metal arrows slide into
his palm.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 29.

ARMORER (CONT'D)
You preload the weapon, collapse it, and
keep it in your shirt pocket, or clip it
anywhere...
Garth mounts a metal arrow in the bow... looks up with an
admiring smile... and TURNS AND AIMS SO FAST IT IS ONE CLEAN
MOTION. THE ARROW SHOOTS OUT... and PINS THE ARMORER'S SHIRT
TO THE WALL. An inch left, neck, not shirt.
Garth walks to the Armorer, who is shaking with fear, and
pulls the arrow out with his fingers.
GARTH
Just kidding. How do you feel? Do you
feel swell?
(on Armorer's emphatic gesture)
I thought you would.
AUTOMATIC DEFENSE UNIT
on a display table. It is a coffin-shaped box. The Armorer
activates a control panel that pops up, switches it on. An
automated machine gun rises, its microservos 'whirring' as it
revolves left, then right.
THE ARMORER, GARTH, REICH, LAPIERE
observe the weapon. The Armorer is still shaken from Garth's
'joke.'
ARMORER
This is a fully automated night defense
mechanism. Turn it on and it will shoot
anything moving beyond a four foot
perimeter. So you can catch some shuteye.
LAPIERE
(snide grin)
Hope you don't toss in your sleep.
Garth depresses the 'off' button and the machine gun recedes
inside its box with a SNAP!
EXT./INT. FLYING HELICOPTER - DAY
Garth, Reich and LaPiere on the passenger bench. Reich hands
Garth a hand radio.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 30.

REICH
(above din of helicopter)
Take this. Radio signals are jammed
inside the mansion, but you can use it
once the power's down... Work your way to
the central atrium, then downstairs to
the computer, shut off the nuke. Then
work your way to the roof and call us.
We'll come in. Simple.
Garth grins cynically at the word 'simple.'
Beyond the chopper windows, the Los Angeles basin stretches
like a vast archaeological dig, fires rising like pillars to
support the smoky sky.
EXT. VINCENT MANSION MOUNTAINTOP - DAY
The chopper maneuvers carefully to avoid the top of the
mansion. The structure is huge, a competitor of the Getty
itself, three stories high and god knows how many stories
below ground, its style inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's
Hollyhock House.
The helicopter lands in the field outside the mansion
grounds. Garth drops out with his equipment. The chopper
rises and speeds away.
FOLLOW GARTH
as he trudges to the mansion's outer walls. They are low,
knee-high so as not to block the view of the mansion. Garth
stands before them for moments with nothing happening. He
picks up a stone and tosses it over the wall.
SENTRY DOGS
appear from either side of the structure and run full-tilt
toward Garth. They are mechanized animals that mimic the real
thing.
Garth watches them approach, doesn't move, weapons still
holstered or strung.
The dogs stop at the wall.
GARTH
Nice doggy... I'm outside the wall. See?
The dogs bark menacingly.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 31.

Garth removes one of the Smith & Wesson pistols from his
belt, holds it casually to his side.
The barking increases.
Garth SHOOTS. ROUNDS SPIT OUT at a rate of five hundred a
minute. THE FIRST DOG IMPLODES. The second shoulders to the
wall itself, increases its barking.
GARTH (CONT'D)
Can't attack anything outside the
perimeter, can you? Ah, the wonderful
world of insurance companies.
Garth replaces the magazine. Aims it at the remaining dog.
Considers.
GARTH (CONT'D)
Ciao, Fido.
Fires. The dog staggers back beneath the CONCUSSIVE FORCE OF
THE STREAM OF BULLETS, then EXPLODES.
Everything is startlingly quiet. Garth replaces the magazine,
reholsters the gun, stares out at the grounds.
GARTH'S POV - THE VINCENT MANSION GROUNDS
invites a stroll... a picnic... an afternoon in Elysium.
RESUME GARTH
as he thinks about this.
Garth leaps the fence and enters the grounds.
No dogs. No response. Nothing.
Somehow, Garth was expecting more. He shrugs, moves for the
house.
Halfway across the grounds Garth freezes.
THE HOUSE - THE SHUTTERS
slam down one by one— pomb! pomb! pomb! — seemingly appearing
in place, to cover the windows with reinforced steel plate.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 32.

RESUME GARTH
as he realizes his progression across the grounds triggered
this defense.
An instant later two more dogs spring from either side of the
building and run toward him.
Garth drops to one knee, pulls the pulse rifle off his
shoulder, brings it up to fire...
A BULLET HITS DEAD CENTER and knocks Garth off his feet. THE
BODY ARMOR FLASHES. A second round hits. A third.
THE DOGS
have Garth bracketed, firing from automatic rifles that have
risen from slots located in their backs.
RESUME GARTH
as he stands and runs for the main entrance, the dogs
following.
Garth slides into a prone position at the main entrance as
THE ROUNDS CONTINUE TO IMPACT.
INSERT - GARTH'S WRIST COUNTER
shows the declining effectiveness of his body armor. 91...
84... 80... 77... 69... (Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!)
RESUME GARTH
as he brings the pulse rifle up, turns to face the incoming
rounds, BODY BOUNCING WITH THEIR IMPACT, and fires.
The first dog disappears in a flash.
Garth turns, IMPACTS STILL MAKING HIS BODY QUAKE, and fires.
The second dog EXPLODES WITH A WHELP.
Garth drops the pulse rifle and stands angrily.
GARTH
(hurting)
Damn! Damn it! Body armor hell!

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 33.

He ejects the battery from the armor, slams a fresh battery
into the slot. Then he drops his packs and shakes and twists
his limbs to relieve the sting.
A MOMENT LATER - GARTH
stands admiring the main entrance. It is a two-story bronze
double-door, with carved Roman figures presenting a battle
tableau.
Garth steps back onto the lawn, ten paces away, looks left,
then right.
GARTH'S POV - THE WINDOWS
steel plate have none of the elegance of this door, but are
formidable nonetheless.
GARTH
paces back to the huge door, removes an explosive charge from
one of the packs, adheres it to the lock and steps away.
A small EXPLOSION.
The door swings open.
INT. ENTRANCE OF VINCENT MANSION - DAY
Garth carries his equipment into the room.
The door swings shut behind him.
Garth drops his packs, tests the door with a shove. Locked.
GARTH
Thought that was too easy.
Garth turns to survey the room.
GARTH'S POV - THE ENTRANCE ROOM
is a vast hall that recedes into the shadows. The lights are
not on. Doors line the walls to either side, each two-stories
tall and each a different shade of green or red.
A statue of the god Jupiter, four times human size, commands
the near space.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 34.

GARTH
hefts his packs and marches to Jupiter, drops them at the
god's feet. He turns to the shadows.
GARTH
(calling out)
Take a potshot at me here, Jupiter is
gonna get a hotfoot!
Nothing. No response.
GARTH (CONT'D)
(softly)
You can come out now, Diana. I know
you're here.
Silence.
Garth shrugs, turns to unload his packs.
A ROBOT
rolls past Garth, who pivots and pulls one of his pistols.
The robot is a jumble of appendages tipped with various
devices. It proceeds to the door, which opens to receive it.
A welding device begins to make repairs on the main lock.
GARTH
watches for a moment... returns the gun to its holster...
removes a tin of food, pulls out a wafer and takes a bite...
opens the notebook computer.
THE COMPUTER SCREEN
is cards being shuffled. The final card: The welder robot.
GARTH (SCENE)
looks up from the screen at the still welding robot.

The robot finishes the repairs. The door closes. The robot
rolls past Garth again. Garth continues to eat the wafer and
doesn't bother to draw a weapon.
GARTH (CONT'D)
Thanks for the prompt service. See you
soon.
The robot lumbers into the shadows down the vast hall.
A FLASHLIGHT BEAM
searches the high reaches of the ceiling. It finds a
television camera eye.
GARTH
keeps the flashlight aimed with one hand, brings a S&W pistol
up, aims, fires.
GARTH
A little to the left...
(fires again)
... once more, with feeling...
THE TELEVISION EYE
high above SHATTERS WITH THE BULLET IMPACT.
GARTH
returns the pistol to its holster.
GARTH
Let's see you repair that.
He moves down the hall, shining the flashlight high looking
for more monitoring stations. He finds one just as the SOUND
of a miniature helicopter whisks past overhead.
Garth pivots and aims the light.
A MINIATURE HELICOPTER
carrying a replacement for the destroyed minicam beneath it,
moves for the destruction site in the corner of the ceiling.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 36.

GARTH
scrambles back.
GARTH
Shit. Spoke too soon.
Aiming the light with one hand, the gun with the other, he
follows the movement of the helicopter near the ceiling.
THE HELICOPTER
flips on its back, bringing the repair module into position
for placement.
Garth's rounds begin to impact all around it... then a direct
hit. EXPLOSION.
(SCENE) GARTH
lowers the weapon and the light. He turns, quickly surveys
the dark ceiling down the hall, then moves.
Garth returns to the second camera site... aims... fires...
moves on.
A third site, opposite wall. The same.
A fourth site, same wall. He aims both light and weapon.
HIGH ANGLE SHOT - GARTH FAR BELOW
as four laser beams shoot out from various locations and hit
him squarely.
GARTH
is thrown ten feet back and to the ground.
STEAM RISES FROM HIS BODY ARMOR.
Garth's closed eyes twitch.
Slowly he comes to.
He glances at his body armor wrist read-out.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 37.

WRIST READ-OUT
Garth's body armor wrist read-out: 09.
GARTH
realizes that another blow like that will penetrate his body
armor and kill him.
Should he move?
Carefully, Garth moves one arm back several inches, then the
other. A leg rises, seeks footing. He shoves himself a foot
farther away from the weapons in the walls and ceiling.
Again. Again. Slowly. Trying not to draw fire. Again.
Garth freezes.
DIANA LOGAN
stands in Garth's path looking down at him. She is not quite
real. She is not quite a ghost, either. She wears an outfit —
military tunic and slacks — that, while very feminine, is
also all business.
DIANA
You are an intruder.
Garth can't quite believe he's not alone. He raises a leg,
moves his shoulders, and shoves himself another foot away
from the weapons... and into Diana, passing through her. He
looks for her source.
GARTH'S POV - THE IMAGE PROJECTOR
is a shoebox with wheels, stopped nearby. A beam of light
shoots out, PROJECTING Diana.
GARTH
pushes himself along the floor again. Diana's feet seem to
grow out of his stomach.
Go away.

GARTH

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 38.

DIANA
I have called the police and they are en

damage yet. Go now and we'll forget this
illegal intrusion.
Garth shoves himself along the floor again. He and Diana seem
to share feet.
GARTH
There are no police.
DIANA
Of course there are police.
GARTH
Talk to them lately?
This shuts her up.
Garth flips over and begins to crawl.
DIANA
You can get up. You're out of range.
GARTH
Yeah. Like I'm going to believe you.
Diana BLINKS OUT OF EXISTENCE.
The shoebox whisks away, engine WHINING.
Garth continues to crawl... rises to his feet... runs.
AT JUPITER - GARTH
leaps behind the statue for cover. Breathing hard, takes
stock of himself. Replaces the body armor battery. (Chinkhum!)
BODY ARMOR READ-OUT
goes from 09 to 100.
GARTH
Pulls a nightscope from his pack, clicks it into place on top
of the pulse rifle, brings it to eye level, takes a look.

The police have turned up Vincent Drive.
There's still time to get away.

looks up from the scope. Diana stands near him, projected by
the shoebox.
DIANA
I don't want you to get into trouble...
Garth swings the rifle around, lazily aims it at the shoebox.
DIANA (CONT'D)
I know a way you can escape. If you'll
just trust—
Garth fires. The shoebox EXPLODES, its parts spinning away.
Diana DISAPPEARS.
Garth brings up the rifle scope.
GARTH'S POV - NIGHTSCOPE - THE HALL
painted orange. The flash of the first round bleeds out
vision for a second. When it returns, Garth has moved the
sight to the next sensor, and fires.
GARTH
takes out the final three sensors.
Digs out a pair of nightgoggles.
GARTH
Hate these goddamn things.
Pulls them on. Stands.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 40.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE HALL
is bathed in a slightly different color.
GARTH
moves down the hall along one wall, looking up, pistol drawn.
He passes where he was knocked unconscious by the laser
beams.
GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE CEILING
Laser weapons hang by wiring, destroyed.
GARTH
pulls off the nightgoggles, hangs them by the strap to the
unused pistol on his belt, wipes sweat away from his brow.
He moves back toward his camp at Jupiter's feet.
JUPITER - GARTH
drops the goggles back into the pack, sits on the pedestal.
Taking a swig of water from his canteen:
GARTH
So, Jupiter, you're a god. What are you
going to do next?
(god's voice)
I'm going to Disneyland!
Garth sees the control panel door imbedded in the pedestal.
GARTH'S FINGER
taps the panel open. A switch. He presses it.
THIRTY, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KIDS
materialize at Jupiter's feet, several occupying the same
space as Garth.
Garth stands, walks around the 3-D projection.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 41.

A BEAM OF LIGHT from behind Jupiter's head is the source for
the PROJECTION, unlike the earlier Diana, the PLAYBACK of a
recording.
Diana greets the children. She wears a tunic similar to the
previous one, slacks, hair tied back, business yes, but
womanly, too.
DIANA
Hello, boys and girls... My name is Diana
Logan.
An unseen teacher prompts:
TEACHER'S VOICE
Kids — you know what to say.
THE CHILDREN
Hello, Ms. Logan!
DIANA
I'm the Chief of Security of this
wonderful place... and I'm going to be
your guide today. Can any of you tell me
who Mr. Vincent is?
THE CHILDREN
Me! Me!... I know!... I raised my hand

Diana picks a shy little girl who has raised her hand.
Garth moves through the PROJECTIONS as if they're ghosts, or
he is.
DIANA
Do you know?
LITTLE GIRL
Theodore Vincent is the richest man in
the world.
DIANA
Yes, some people say that... It may even
be true... But the Mr. Vincent I know
loves art more than anything else in the
world. He built this residence so that
someday it can be converted into a
museum.
LITTLE BOY
Just like the Getty!

Garth stops finally before Diana and studies her. This
PROJECTION is obviously a recording, and unaware of his
presence.
DIANA
(laughs)
I'm not sure he would appreciate that...
but you're right... someday this
magnificent building will be like the
Getty, a museum for everyone to visit.
Today you're very lucky children, because
I'm going to show you what most kids
don't get a chance to see — the Vincent
treasures.
The children chortle their anticipation. The PROJECTION GOES
DARK.
Leaving Garth standing in shadows.
GARTH
So that's what you were like... in life.
No one answers.
Garth shrugs off the mood, moves.
NOTEBOOK COMPUTER SCREEN - THE MANSION FLOORPLAN

Eenie-meenie-minie-moe...
AT BRONZE DOUBLE DOORS - GARTH
drops his pack and rifle, removes an explosive and places the
charge against the door, retreats ten feet.
BOOM!
Garth opens the doors to the new gallery.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 43.

THE GALLERY
is half as long as the hall. Life-size statues line the
corridor at ten-feet intervals.
Garth stands at the threshold, pack, rifle, ready.
Nothing moves in the darkness.
Something in Garth's hands: The remains of the shoebox
device.
Garth tosses the twisted metal far into the gallery.
MIDDLE OF GALLERY - A SEALED BEAM
is broken by the rolling shoebox.
DIANA AND HER THIRTY KIDS MATERIALIZE in the darkness.
DIANA
This gallery is called 'The Greek Room'
because the antiquities displayed here
originated in classical times. Does
anyone know what 'classical' means?
CHILDREN
I do! I do!... No, me! Me!
GARTH
watches the ghost show thirty yards distant.
GARTH

'Classic' means 50s rock'n'roll.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE CEILING
Same TV sensors as before. Same laser weaponry.

FIRES.
FAR CEILING - CAMERA AND WEAPON

Realizing that the ceiling weapons aren't designed to fire

DIANA'S VOICE
Although in recent years some people have
begun using the term, 'Before Common Era'
or B.C.E. in deference to other cultures
or other religious beliefs.

This leaves the two camera/laser rifles located in the
ceiling directly above the threshold.
Garth dares to lean out, look up.
A LASER BEAM STRIKES, barely missing his head as he snaps
back.
Garth pulls the nightgoggles back over his eyes. Steeling
himself, Garth leaps into the gallery.

leaps inside, rolling toward the nearest statue as LASER
BEAMS TRACE HIS PATH.
Garth pulls himself behind the silhouette of the statue as

The second round misses.
LASER FIRE STRIKES his body armor.

THE WRIST READ-OUT DROPS FROM 100 TO 61.
Garth drops to the floor and FIRES again.
The laser GOES DARK MID-FIRE.
DIANA
... Hector, the greatest hero of Troy,
who fought Achilles, whose mother made
him almost invulnerable by dipping all

Garth tears the goggles off, sweating, breathing hard.
GARTH
Maybe that's why women think guys are
heels.
Garth replaces his body armor battery with one from the pack.
DIANA
... is Helen, as one ancient artist saw
her...
GARTH
Shut up! Goddamn it!
The shout echoes through the marble hall.
LITTLE GIRL
She's not very pretty...
LITTLE BOY
And she's naked!

Well yes, beauty, it's said, is in the

human body is often depicted nude...
Gulping water from his canteen:

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 47.

DIANA AND THE CHILDREN DISAPPEAR just as a REPAIRBOT SHOOTS
THROUGH THE IMAGE, whisking by to repair the door that Garth
just blew.
Garth turns and fires on instinct, sending the REPAIR DEVICE
BURNING, SPARKING AND SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.
GARTH
with the nightgoggles shoved high onto his forehead, walks
down the gallery, carrying the pulse rifle lazily in one
hand.
The repairbot lies a jumble of twisted metal and smoking
circuit boards.
Helen stares down at him from her pedestal.
Garth stops to appraise her.
GARTH
That kid doesn't know anything, Helen...
You're a hotty.
Helen's pose does not change, although the flashlight in
Garth's hand shifts her shadows as he moves forward.
Garth crosses the sealed beam that activated the film before.
DIANA AND THE CHILDREN APPEAR.
DIANA
This gallery is called 'The Greek Room'

DIANA
The controller is located in that panel.
You can turn the tour off.
Garth is conflicted. Could the panel be boobytrapped?

Garth steps to the wall, opens the panel, presses the 'stop'

Garth pivots and marches back to his 'camp.'
Diana, and her shoebox, follow.
DIANA
Who are you?
GARTH
I'm alive. You're dead. That's all either
of us needs to know.
DIANA
I know what I am.
GARTH
You're a program, a doppelganger...
You're not real anymore.
DIANA
I am a disembodied human being. Vincent
Enterprises developed a way to move my
consciousness into this computer... all
of it... me.
GARTH
Are you sure?
Diana has no answer for this.
DIANA
What are you doing here?
GARTH
That should be obvious.
DIANA
Why haven't the police come? Why don't
they answer?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 49.

GARTH
I told you — there are no police.
DIANA
What's happened to the world?
GARTH
The same as you... Worse.
Garth begins to gather up his equipment and supplies.
DIANA
If you go any further, you'll wish the
police came and stopped you.
GARTH
Is that right?
DIANA
This facility is defended by a noncommercial upgrade of a Vincent Embassy
Protection System — VEPS. In case you're
too ignorant to know what that means...
fully lethal defense systems. Killing
machines, Mr. ...
Garth brings the pulse rifle up.
The shoebox retreats into the darkness.
Diana BEGINS TO FADE, lose resolution, as the device
retreats.
DIANA (CONT'D)
Please stop destroying my —
Garth fires.
KABLOOM!
DIANA WINKS OUT.
ANOTHER ANGLE - GARTH
finishes gathering his supplies, carts everything down the
gallery.
As he crosses the sealed beam mid-gallery:
DIANA
Please stop destroying my mobile
projectors.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 50.

WHERE THE TOUR DIANA ONCE STOOD, NOW THE CURRENT DIANA IS
PROJECTED.
DIANA (CONT'D)
They're inoffensive. They carry no
weapons.
Garth looks at her for a long moment.
GARTH
You have a point. Get to it.
DIANA
My point is that I don't want you to die.
GARTH
You care about what happens to me?
DIANA
Of course I do...
GARTH
And your boss, Vincent... he cared when
he installed all these killing machines
to protect his expensive trinkets?
DIANA
He never expected to need them! He
installed them as a deterrent.
GARTH
So he never expected anyone to get
killed?
DIANA
Of course not.
GARTH
Or hurt someone, even?
No!

DIANA
GARTH
Then I should be dodging blanks now...
You were Vincent's Chief of Security even
before you died, right?
Yes.

DIANA

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 51.

GARTH
You don't strike me as the kind of person
who winds up being Chief of Security.
DIANA
It's a little late in my career to start
quibbling over qualifications, don't you
think?... But I have a masters degree in
police science.
GARTH
You and Vincent were friends, correct?
DIANA
You're trying to insinuate something.
GARTH
And you're a good looking woman... or
were.
DIANA
(cynical grin)
You bastard!
GARTH
Not a new observation... So you were
lovers for awhile... then he rewarded
you.
DIANA
I hope your death is quick and painless.
DIANA DISAPPEARS.
Garth grins.
WHAM!
THE GALLERY DOORS
at the end of the hall slam open and a dozen flying minihelicopters bank through.
GARTH
yanks the nightgoggles down, brings the rifle up.
GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE FLYING MACHINES
carry fully functional weaponry from their undercarriages.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 52.

(SCENE) GARTH
STARTS FIRING even as he leaps toward the statue of Helen.
PULSE BEAMS BEGIN FLASHING all around him.
CHOPPERS BEGIN FALLING, SPIRALING, EXPLODING AS THEY ARE HIT.
Garth hugs the base of the statue, believing that its
presence will protect him.
Until a pulse beam from a helicopter SLICES THE STATUE IN
TWO.
Garth is without cover as the statue disintegrates above him.
Garth's weapon is on full automatic: Boom-boom-boom-boom...
GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE MINI-CHOPPERS
continue to swoop down, firing pulse beams. There are seven
left.
GARTH
checks his wrist read-out: 04.
Garth slams another battery into his body armor.
A PULSE ROUND SLICES THROUGH HIS ARM before the power jerks
on. He grimaces in pain.
Garth's rifle is empty. The read-out, in red: 0.
Garth tosses the rifle and pulls both S&W autopistols.
He swings the fully automatic pistols together, creating a
minigun, AND FIRES.
The remaining HELICOPTERS EXPLODE within the sweep of
bullets.
Silence.
Garth shakes marble dust from his clothing, kicks chunks of
Helen away. Part of her face lands on his shoulder. On his
look:
GARTH
Must be a fake.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 53.

(SCENE) - RIFLE - GARTH
staggers out from the destroyed statue of Helen, retrieves
the weapon.
GARTH
Now that wasn't so bad, was it?
Takes stock. His left arm is bleeding. Clothes ripped.
Hungry. Tired. Thirsty. Licking his dry lips, he turns to
retrieve his canteen —
WHEN A STREAM OF BULLETS HITS HIM, slip-sliding his body
uncontrollably across the floor.
THE TANK
is little more than treads with a machine gun mounted on it,
now wheeling through the far open doors.
GARTH
slides behind the statue of Achilles. It must be real. The
bullets stop.
Garth pulls himself from a stupor, takes stock.
Arm still bleeding. Clothes still torn. Fingers move. Feet,
too.
Wrist read-out: 03. Another battery shot.
Garth reaches to pull a fresh battery from his belt, exposing
an arm WHERE BULLETS RIDDLE THE WALL AN INCH TO THE RIGHT.
Carefully now, he replaces the body armor battery.
The movement causes the machine gun to track him. Up-down,
left-right, servos whining. Only the statue keeps the unit
from firing.
DIANA'S SHOEBOX
rolls up behind the tank, halts as if concerned about being
shot by Garth, then advances.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 54.

DIANA MATERIALIZES
near Garth.
DIANA
You're hurt.
Go away.

GARTH
DIANA
You should apply direct pressure to that.
GARTH
I said... GO AWAY!
DIANA
I know who you are.
Garth tries to stop the flow of blood by applying direct
pressure. He winces.
GARTH
(preoccupied)
You do?
DIANA
You're Major John Garth, United States
Army Rangers. You were born in Pasadena,
California, in March —
GARTH
So you found my goddamn records!
DIANA
Why is an honorable man like you breaking
into a private residence?
GARTH
There are no more honorable human beings
— just hungry ones.
DIANA
Is that all? You're hungry? I can tell
you where there's food. Tons of it.
GARTH
Tons of it?
DIANA
Earthquake supplies. Wafers; cakes; MREs
— meals-ready-to-eat; bread; water;

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 55.

DIANA (cont'd)
coffee — instant; coffee — drip; you name
it.
Garth moves slowly, watching the weapon track him.
GARTH
And you're going to show me how to get at
it... without getting my dick shot off.
Diana says nothing for a long moment. Then:
DIANA
If you drop your weapons, VEPS won't take
action against you.
GARTH
You mean... if I surrender, I can walk
around here without being shot at?
DIANA
No... You'll be taken into custody, held
for —
GARTH
The police.
DIANA
That is the procedure.
GARTH
There is no police.
DIANA
So you say.
Garth shifts. The machine gun follows him, servos whining.
The statue continues to provide cover.
GARTH
Why don't you just... turn the machines
off?
DIANA
I can't do that.
GARTH
Aren't you the Chief of Security? Aren't
you the soul of the machine? Why can't
you just stop shooting at me?
DIANA
It doesn't work like that.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 56.

GARTH
Your mind controls everything, doesn't
it?
DIANA
Yes, but... the defensive equipment is
linked to my autonomic nervous system. I
can no more stop the defensive units than
I can stop breathing.
GARTH
You aren't breathing. You're a goddamn
ghost.
Diana thinks about that for a second. Yes, that's exactly
what she is.
DIANA
My mind works the same way as when... I
was alive. That's why Mr. Vincent gave me
this opportunity, to remain... alive...
inside EnCrypt.
GARTH
Where is Vincent, by the way?
Diana turns away, considering the question.
(SCENE) GARTH
throws the spent battery.
The tank gun tracks the flight of the battery into the
darkness.
Garth leaps out from behind the statue and lands on the tank.
The tank gun barrel tries to find Garth, who stands above it,
beyond its tracking range.
Garth pulls a survival knife, begins to pry open the tanks's
metal access plate.
The tank's treads SQUEAL as it accelerates toward the nearest
unadorned wall. Garth hangs on, prying with the knife.
The tank slams into the wall, almost throws Garth, backs up,
slams into the wall again.
Garth clings to the machine gun barrel, yanks off the access
plate, stabs the knife deep into a row of circuit boards.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 57.

The tank SPITS SMOKE AND SPARKS, DIES.
Garth removes the ammo feeder, tosses it into the darkness.
Sucking for wind, sweat cascading from his skin, Garth eyes
Diana warily as she slowly walks to the tank.
DIANA AND GARTH
study one another for a long moment before:
GARTH
If you can't shut the damn things off...
maybe you can warn me.
Warn you?

DIANA
GARTH
You know where everything is, don't you?
You know which machines are operational,
which ones are in stand-by mode, which
ones—
DIANA
Really, this whole question would be a
moot point... if you just surrendered.
GARTH
So you can hold me for the police?
DIANA
Certainly. You have less to fear from
them...
(looking back toward the
darkness)
... than me.
GARTH
That might be a long wait.
DIANA
So you say.
GARTH
You might save my life... if you briefed
me on what to expect.
Diana considers that possibility for a moment. Then:

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 58.

DIANA
This is not the pattern of a burglar. A
burglar would have taken something and
gone.
Garth merely looks at her image as it moves.
DIANA (CONT'D)
If there really is no police, as you
say... then you've come to cut the power
and take everything. That...
(surveys him)
... is why I won't help you.
GARTH
If I cut the power, what becomes of you?
DIANA
I will become what you say I already am.
GARTH
Death as a blackout. I've feared worse
things.
DIANA
Go now. Take whatever you find back
there. If you go forward, you won't
survive.
Garth retrieves his rifle, slides a fresh battery into it. It
HUMS.
GARTH
Yeah, I've heard that before, too.
Diana considers this exchange a moment, then DISAPPEARS.
DIANA'S SHOEBOX
whines away into the darkness, passing through the opened
double doors at the end of the corridor.
GARTH
gathers up the rest of his equipment, drinks from the
canteen, limps back to the pack.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 59.

AEROSOL SPRAY SKIN
flows onto Garth's wound, sealing everything. Garth tosses
the can away, rips open a low-tech field bandage, gently
places it on the wound in his arm.
IN A CORNER OF THE GALLERY - GARTH
crumples against the wall. Depleted, he must rest.
An afterthought, he pulls the Automatic Defense Unit from the
pack, opens the panel, flicks it on.
THE GUN
rises from its coffin-shaped container and enters 'ready'
mode, barrel poised to fire at any target that presents
itself.
GARTH
makes sure that he's within the four-foot fire-free zone
around the gun, then removes the gunbelt and makes himself
comfortable. He searches the pack for fast energy food. The
bite-sized snacks fall through his fingers like coins.
GARTH
(reading labels)
Chicken gumbo... (tosses it)... Steak
Tartar with red dye number seven...
(tosses it)... allergic to red dye number
seven... Brandy Mousse...
(unwrapping the plastic)
Combat is getting elegant.
(chews - reacts)
Think ya got enough sugar in there,
Butch?
MOMENTS LATER - GARTH
lies sleeping, head propped against the wall.
THE HALLS OF THE RESIDENCE
are long and dark.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 60.

Debris of combat gives way to shining floors and pools of
purple nebulae.
FLOAT THROUGH THE CORRIDORS
past Garth sleeping on the floor... into the gallery of
paintings... through opening doors into the gallery of
jewels... through more doors into other realms of historic
order... until a woman waits at the end of the gallery.
ELAINE is beautiful, with long, flowing red hair and skin the
color of porcelain. Her green-green eyes glow like emeralds,
her red lips not tainted by makeup but truly red, teeth as
perfect as creation before the end of Eden.
GARTH
stands before her. He is not wearing torn combat clothes, but
a suit styled by future hands.
ELAINE
John... how I've wanted to hold you
again.
GARTH
Elaine, let me take you home.
ELAINE
(shaking her head 'no')
I have a different home now... Do you
know what became of me?
This is a question he would rather not contemplate.
GARTH
I searched for you, Elaine, I did!
ELAINE
There was no food, Garth. There was
nothing. Our son was hungry. I kept
waiting for you to come, but... you
didn't. So I went out looking for food...
The market was empty. There were men
there, Garth. They raped me. Then they
butchered me and took my flesh to their
homes and fed their families with me.
This last thing I didn't mind. I saved a
child's life. At least, my body did.
Garth can take this story no more.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 61.

GARTH
Elaine! God, no!
The pain is more than he can bare. Garth drops to his knees,
tears and snot and saliva spewing from him as he bellows his
pain.
ELAINE
(reaching to touch, but unable)
Don't mourn me, John. What's done is
done. But you're still alive.
GARTH
I'm not alive, Elaine. None of us is
alive anymore!
ELAINE
Yes you are. You owe it to those of us
who are dead — stay alive, John!
INT. GALLERY
Garth snaps awake beside the wall. Nothing has changed from
when he went to sleep. Except a haunting SOUND drifting from
a far place. Garth turns off the Automatic Defense Unit,
grabs his rifle, moves for the far double doors.
GALLERY OF PAINTINGS - GARTH
stops at the threshold, snaps the nightgoggles down, looks
in.
GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE GALLERY OF LANDSCAPES
No sensors. No weaponry in the ceiling.
GARTH
pushes the goggles up, considers.
The haunting SOUND is closer, but still not close.
Garth leaps into a run down the gallery toward the noise.
As he passes a closed beam mid-gallery, DIANA AND HER THIRTY
CHILDREN APPEAR as 3-D projections.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 62.

DIANA
This, boys and girls, is the Gallery of
Landscapes...
(etc.)
THE GALLERY OF PORTRAITS - GARTH
stops at its threshold, flips the nightgoggles down, looks.
GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - GALLERY OF PORTRAITS
Again no sensors, or weapons.
GARTH
advances into the hall. The SOUND is closer now, a haunting,
otherworldly wail.
Gath brings the pulse rifle up, checks the charge (100 in
green), advances.
The SOUND grows louder, louder yet, increasing in volume and
emotion, a noise so terrifying that its existence seems
impossible.
A GHOST
floats through the far doorway and turns, heading toward
Garth. It is the corpse of a man, arms and legs dangling,
eyes glowing red, the wordless wail rising from its throat.
GARTH
grins.
GARTH
Ah, a ghost...
Garth brings the pulse rifle up, takes his time aiming. He
FIRES.
The ghost TWISTS IN THE HOLD OF SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS, writhing
and bellowing its unearthly, artificial SOUND until its
DISGUISE AS A GHOST LOSES DEFINITION AND THE MACHINE BEHIND
IT CAN BE PERCEIVED. It begins to falter.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 63.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GARTH
is so preoccupied with the ghost that he doesn't see the mansized robot roll toward him from behind. The robot grabs him
with huge pincer-arms, causing Garth to drop the pulse rifle.
The robot's momentum carries them past the sealed beam which
ACTIVATES YET ANOTHER DIANA 3-D projection.
DIANA
Okay guys, this is the fun gallery, at
least for me... These are all portraits
of real people from history...
(etc.)
Garth writhes in the hands of the robot, its STEEL FINGERS
CLOSING ON HIS BODY ARMOR, WHICH SPARKS WITH RESISTANCE.
Garth's single free hand slams against the robot's metal
skin, without effect.
Garth pulls the survival knife, rams it into a crevice in the
robot body, jerks it, snapping off the tip of the blade.
The robot turns with Garth's splayed body, moving for some
dark destination.
A last ditch effort, Garth slams the broken blade into one of
the paintings as they pass. The blade digs deep into the
canvas and is dragged an inch before the robot halts.
(SCENE) THE ROBOT'S SOULLESS EYES MEET GARTH'S
in crystal understanding: If the robot continues, Garth will
destroy the painting.
Moments pass as Garth's lungs suck air and sweat cascades
from his brow.
The blade moves a millimeter in the canvas flesh, a woman's
bosom.
The robot's eyes move to the painting, back to Garth.
One robot hand relaxes. On Garth's movement, the other.
Garth slowly pulls himself from the robot's grasp, steps
down.
While the steel hands are empty, GUN BARRELS LOCATED IN THE
ROBOT'S CHEST follow Garth's every movement.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 64.

Moments pass. Garth reaches for the fallen rifle.
The robot watches.
Garth's fingers almost make contact with the weapon. Will he
have to release the knife in order to retrieve the rifle?
Garth gives up, withdraws his hand... and extends a leg,
makes contact with the rifle.
The robot whirls and accelerates down the gallery, its tracks
squealing in retreat.
Garth releases the blade and retrieves the rifle, brings it
up to shoot.
The first round hits the retreating robot as IT WHISKS
THROUGH THE 3-D IMAGE OF DIANA AND HER CHILDREN like an
aircraft through clouds.
Garth FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN...
PULSE BOLTS STRIKE the robot repeatedly. It explodes in fire
and wanders off track, finally stopping altogether.
An unearthly SOUND makes Garth spin around.
MORE GHOSTS
float across the threshold of the far gallery, each different
in its horrific representation — a child, a crone, a woman,
a man...
(SCENE) GARTH
begins firing immediately.
So do the ghosts — PULSE BOLTS THAT STRIKE GARTH'S ARMOR AND
FLASH.
The FIRST GHOST IS DESTROYED, the child.
The SECOND, the crone.
The THIRD, closing with Garth, DIES IN AN EXPLOSION of
metallic flesh.
But by the time he turns the pulse rifle on the fourth, the
woman, the rifle is depleted. Garth retreats.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 65.

(SCENE) FOLLOW GARTH AND THE GHOST
as they move through the Gallery of Landscapes to the Gallery
of Roman Statues, Garth MERE FEET AHEAD OF THE SCREAMING
BANSHEE, SOMETIMES DODGING, AND SOMETIMES NOT DODGING THE
PULSE BOLTS the machine spits at him.
(SCENE) GALLERY OF STATUES - GARTH
dives for his waiting S&W pistols as the GHOST CONTINUES TO
FIRE PULSE ROUNDS at him.
Garth brings the PISTOLS UP AND STARTS FIRING.
The ghost ABSORBS THE ROUNDS AGAINST ITS METAL SKIN, its
'ghost' persona fading to reveal the stainless steel monster
beneath.
Both weapons are emptied of bullets.
The ghost floats menacingly before Garth for seconds, THEN
DROPS LIKE SCRAP TO THE FLOOR.
Garth sags to his knees, finally begins reloading the
weapons.
ELAINE'S VOICE
No, don't, silly! No... No!
3-D ELAINE,
wearing jean cutoffs and a pull-over, STRUGGLES WITH AN
UNSEEN PERSON WHERE DIANA'S 3-D PROJECTION TOURED WITH
CHILDREN MINUTES AGO. This is not the idealized Elaine of
Garth's dream, but the real woman, capable of soil, sweat,
anger and tears.
ELAINE
(laughing)
Don't you dare!... You would not dare!...
Don't you do it!
Garth is too surprised to realize that this is a 3-D
PROJECTION. He twists, moves toward her.
Elly?

GARTH

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 66.

A garden hose APPEARS IN THE FILM PROJECTION... then a
younger Garth himself, who sprays Elaine. They are both
laughing.
ELAINE
Damn you, John Garth!
A LITTLE BOY RUNS UP with a bucket of water and splashes his
mother with it.
ELAINE (CONT'D)
Oh no! You! I'm going to get you!
Elaine chases her son farther into the backyard.
DIANA'S SHOEBOX AND DIANA
EMERGE THROUGH THE 3-D PROJECTION of Elaine and her family.
DIANA
The National Security computer in
Arlington, Virginia, is still up... Mr.
Vincent has a key... The satellite
communication system is still working.
Garth cares about none of this. Seeing Elaine again is far
more important than anything Diana could say.
DIANA (CONT'D)
During your last security clearance
review... they placed you under
surveillance... shot some film of your
family.
The 3-D film of Garth's backyard is REPLACED BY A TREE-LINED
WALK. The boy runs ahead as Elaine and Garth stroll, hand-inhand.
DIANA (CONT'D)
You two look... wonderful... together.
Younger Garth and Elaine stop walking and steal a kiss.
DIANA (CONT'D)
What happened?
The images of Elaine and his son draw Garth's flesh forward,
where he topples to his knees beside them. Tears well in his
eyes. Finally:

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 67.

GARTH
When the breakdown occurred... we were
visiting Elaine's mother in Santa Monica.
My father is dying of cancer. He lived in
Burbank. I went to get him. There were
riots, people killing each other,
fires... I was gone days. When I finally
got back... there was no one there.
DIANA
You don't know what happened to your wife
and child?
No.

GARTH
The 3-D FILM ENDS.
GARTH (CONT'D)
Is that all there is?
Yes.

DIANA
GARTH
Play it again!... PLAY IT AGAIN!
DIANA
No... unless you stop what you're doing
and —
WHAM! Garth FIRES AT DIANA'S SHOEBOX sending the device
flying in parts. DIANA DEMATERIALIZES.
Bitch!

GARTH
Garth sits on his knees for moments, sweat and tears
commingling, breathing hard, trying to fathom what has become
of everything and everyone he loved.
DIANA REAPPEARS, projected by the tour lenses that previously
showed Elaine and Garth's son.
GARTH (CONT'D)
Now you know.
DIANA
I was able to link with the national
weather satellites through the Arlington
computer... Yes, now I know.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 68.

GARTH
Lower your security systems. Let Reich
steal all your trinkets. I'll take the
food, for the people... then you can go
back to what you —
No.
Why not?

DIANA
GARTH
DIANA
Because I can't. I told you. The security
devices are controlled through my
autonomic nervous system. They are as
automatic as breathing.
GARTH
Then show me how to defeat them.
No.
Why not?

DIANA
GARTH
DIANA
Because I'm not here to be your doormat.
GARTH
That earthquake food... it could feed a

DIANA
So you say...
GARTH
So I say? SO I SAY?! People are eating
each other out there!
Diana is stunned by this revelation, made mute by it.
GARTH (CONT'D)
When was the last time you were hungry?
Diana can't answer that. So long ago, it seems forever...
GARTH (CONT'D)
I'm going to take this place, like any

Until I can think of something! We're not

But he is speaking to darkness. DIANA HAS GONE.
(SCENE) GARTH'S EQUIPMENT
lies in piles. He moves to retrieve it.
Slams a new battery into the pulse rifle.
Returns the pistol belt to his waist; slides the pistols into
holsters.
Shoves the Automatic Defense System into the pack.
Hefts everything, moves for the door.
GALLERY OF LANDSCAPES - GARTH
trudges through, makes an immediate right.
DIANA APPEARS BEHIND HIM.
DIANA
John Garth... why are you going that way?
GARTH
Because all of the doors are unlocked...
(gestures toward Diana)
... that way.
FAR GALLERY DOUBLE DOORS - GARTH
drops his pack, removes an explosive, places it at locklevel, stands back.
The EXPLOSION trips the lock. The door swings open.
Garth pulls the nightgoggles down, steps to the threshold.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 70.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE GALLERY OF LIGHT CARVINGS
is unlike the other galleries. The statues glow. They are
lifelike, carved by laser light, an intermingling of
photography and sculpting, here magnified a thousand times by
the goggle's infrared.
GARTH
quickly shoves the nightgoggles from his eyes and rubs them.
DIANA MATERIALIZES before him, projected by a new shoebox.
DIANA
This is the Gallery of Laser Carvings.
Everything in here is very fragile. If a
bullet were to hit a carving and cause a
short...
GARTH
I sometimes feel the same way when a
bullet whizzes past my head.
Garth pushes through her into the gallery.
GALLERY OF LIGHT CARVINGS - GARTH
quickly checks the ceilings for sensors or laser rifles.
None.
Garth grabs his equipment, begins moving forward.
THE STATUES
are 3-D projections of light carved by an artist to represent
life and projected up from a base. Think Kodachrome. Some of
the statues are modern and geometric. Others are almost
indistinguishable from life — a fawn, a waterfall, a soldier
in combat, lovers holding hands, others.
A STATUE OF A NUDE WOMAN
catches Garth's attention. He moves for the exhibit.
The statue is twice life size. She is gathering flowers to
her breast, a garland of flowers in her hair. Her expression
is one of rapt beauty, a representation of a woman at peace
in a peaceful world.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 71.

It is Diana.
DIANA AND GARTH
look up at the light carving.
DIANA
(unconvincing)
I'm not ashamed of it.
Garth drops his packs, circles the statue, saying nothing.
DIANA (CONT'D)
I was a graduate student at UCLA... Mr.
Vincent was one of the pioneers of laser
carving.
GARTH
You can stop calling him 'Mr.' now.
DIANA
(an outburst)
I'll call him any damn thing I want!...
(controlling herself)
... He pursued me to model for him.
Finally, I relented.
GARTH
Was he that good... or were you that
good?
Diana looks away angrily. Then:
DIANA
Mr. Vincent's interest in me... exceeded
the professional. He was in love with me.
I never returned the affection.
GARTH
You're lying.
What?

DIANA
GARTH
He bought you. He bought you with a job
and he bought you with a laser statue.
You want me to believe he didn't buy the
rest of you too?
DIANA
You son of a bitch!

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 72.

GARTH
Vincent's not the kind of guy who doesn't
get what he wants... unless...
DIANA
Unless what?
Garth considers not going on. But:
GARTH
When you were diagnosed as terminal, did
you get a second opinion?
DIANA
Of course I got a second opinion!
GARTH
Not one of Vincent's doctors?
DIANA
No! What are you implying?
GARTH
He won you after all, didn't he? I mean,
he got to keep you, young and beautiful,
in his one-of-a-kind supercomputer...
never to grow old... never to die...
immortal and his, forever...
Diana charges Garth. Just as HER 3-D HAND WOULD MAKE CONTACT
with his face, SHE DISAPPEARS.
THE NEXT GALLERY DOORS
are also locked. Garth places the explosive, steps aside, and
the lock EXPLODES.
Garth flips the nightgoggles down, glances in.
GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE HALLWAY
is unadorned and relatively narrow, a real passageway.
No sensors in the ceilings, no weapons that can be seen.
GARTH
hefts his equipment and enters the hallway.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 73.

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM
slices the darkness. More doors, more hallway.
The flashlight swung in the opposite direction reveals
shining metal doors: An elevator.
GARTH
moves down the hall toward the elevator, flashlight beam
leading the way.
He drops the pack, surveys the elevator controls.
THE ELEVATOR CONTROLS
require both a key and a key card.
GARTH
drops the pack, removes the computer, runs a line from a rear
port to a card, inserts it into the card slot adjacent to the
elevator.
The computer begins running numbers through the card key.
Garth finds a small case in the pack, opens it: Burglary
tools.
Garth begins to pick the standard lock.
DIANA APPEARS BESIDE GARTH
DIANA
So you're a common burglar after all?
GARTH
(working)
Uncommon. For the CIA.
DIANA
Fair play's poster children.
GARTH
I'd argue the point... but it doesn't
really matter anymore, now does it?
Diana allows the vitriol to recede. Then:

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 74.

DIANA
John, I don't want you to do this.
GARTH
John, is it? I hadn't realized we'd
become so chummy.
DIANA
(wryly)
Well, you've seen me naked. I thought
that would count for something.
GARTH
Get on with it.
DIANA
If you go downstairs... I can't protect
you.
Garth turns, gives her his full attention.
GARTH
Protect me?!
DIANA
You don't really think you've defeated
all of our security systems by yourself,
do you? What if I had sent them all at
once?
Bullshit.

GARTH
DIANA
No. It's not... John, listen to me —
downstairs is different. Mr. Vincent's
residence is there, the computer room,
the weapons storage bays... There's a
stand-alone system down there, fully
automated, a terrible killing machine
that —
GARTH
(returning to work)
Bullshit.
DIANA
It's called The Rook. It was designed to
replace soldiers on the battlefield. It's
dormant now, in a state of suspension,
but as soon as your heat signature is
read on the bottom floor, The Rook will
activate and it will kill you.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 75.

Garth searches her eyes for any signs of deception, then
realizes that he is looking at a machine projection. He
shrugs and returns to jimmying the lock.
The elevator door slides open.
Garth steps back. After a moment:
GARTH
You're lying... First, your defense
mechanisms were designed to deal with
terrorists — plural — more than one.
They're set to activate individually, as
needed. That's why you didn't send them
all at once... Second, you'd say anything
— do anything — to keep me from going
down there. Am I right?
Garth gathers his equipment, turns away from the elevator.
DIANA
Where are you going?
GARTH
That elevator opened too easily... and
you control it.
THE HIDDEN DOOR
is a panel in the wall. Garth finds it, presses it. It opens.
A stairwell leading down.
Garth flips the nightgoggles down, takes a look:
THE STAIRWELL
hides no weapons.
GARTH
hefts his equipment, enters.
STAIRWELL - GARTH
descends the steps quickly, flashlight beam leading the way.
At the landing, Garth tries the door. Locked. He'll have to
blow it.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 76.

THE LOCK IGNITES
and the door swings ajar.
GARTH
swings the door open with the barrel of his pulse rifle,
revealing:
THE VINCENT RESIDENCE
is a cavernous room, a vast "pleasure dome" to compare with
Kublai Khan's. Laser statuary, nudes mostly, illuminate the
shadows, a glowing Christmas tree effect. Fountains and ponds
divide the real estate, a waterfall across the room defines
it. There are park benches, grassy knolls, trees hanging low
with weighted boughs, jutting boulders, and room enough to
live forever unencumbered by petty problems.
DIANA'S SHOEBOX
rolls to the open door. Diana's IMAGE PROJECTS out.
Garth remains across the threshold.
DIANA
Don't do this. The moment you enter, The
Rook will be activated.
Garth snorts with disbelief and enters.
Dazzling lights flash on the moment he crosses the threshold.
THE VINCENT ARMORY - A ROOK,
a humanoid creature with steel skin lies immersed in a wall
tableau, art and war meeting in bas relief.
Its eyes open, red pupils scanning.
THE VINCENT RESIDENCE - GARTH
drops his packs, lowers the rifle to the floor, dazzled by
the room.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 77.

GARTH
Vincent certainly knew how to live,
didn't he?
Diana says nothing, but her image follows him.
GARTH (CONT'D)
Where'd he sleep?
Diana gestures: Over there.
THE VINCENT BEDROOM
is not delineated by walls. A huge bed seems to grow out of a
giant oak, its mattress almost like a meadow of green.
Overhead, man-made stars twinkle even in room light.
Garth wanders up a lane toward it, eyes taking in everything.
THE VINCENT ARMORY - THE ROOK
moves minutely as below it a computer screen flashes: ROOK
INITIATING PROTOCOL - INTRUDER ALERT.
THE VINCENT BEDROOM - GARTH
touches the oak bed. It feels like real wood, with no rough
edges.
Diana's shoebox projector follows, as does she.
GARTH
When you have this kind of money... this
kind of power... I guess you can have
anything you want.
DIANA
Mr. Vincent was known for his
imagination.
A quarter-sized statue of a nude man and woman in embrace
stands near the bed. Garth touches it and the two come to
life and begin to make love.
GARTH
You didn't pose for this one too?
Coital cries erupt from them.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 78.

DIANA
(uncomfortable)
Touch it again. Please.
Taking a close look at the woman's body.
GARTH
She looks a little like you... here and
there.
DIANA
(exasperated)
Touch it again! Please!
Garth touches the light statue and it returns to its starting
point and freezes.
GARTH
(gesturing other statuary)
Who were all these people?
DIANA
Mr. Vincent had many lovers.
GARTH
The man in the sculpture... that was
Vincent?
DIANA
No... maybe... I don't know! Please leave
here! Now! I'll do what I can to stop
anything from happening to you, but
you've got to get out of here now.
GARTH
For a woman who's spent the last twenty
years inhabiting this place, you don't
seem to know a lot about it.
DIANA
I don't spend that much time in the
residence.
Why not?

GARTH
DIANA
(turning away)
Privacy. A matter of privacy.
GARTH
Yours... or Vincent's?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 79.

DIANA
BOTH! You've got to go!
Garth merely looks at her.
DIANA DISAPPEARS.
THE VINCENT ARMORY - DIANA
MATERIALIZES beside the Rook. Mist flows from around the
creature, which was in cryogenic stasis. Its body temperature
is rising.

DIANA MATERIALIZES beside him.
DIANA
The Rook is activated! It's coming!
Garth observes her coolly for a moment. Then:
GARTH
If you're so concerned about my welfare,
then tell me how to protect myself
against this machine.
DIANA
I can't! I can just warn you to go!

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 80.

GARTH
Why should you care so much about me?
DIANA
You're a human being, aren't you? You're
alive. You can't appreciate life until
you've lost it.
The admission impacts Garth. He sits up.
GARTH
If you can't tell me how to defeat this
thing, then tell me about it.
DIANA
The Rook is a fully autonomous combat
operative. Its body armor is five times
more effective than the obsolete armor
you wear. This model has been programmed
to kill with its hands, to protect
property. It will tear your head from
your body.
GARTH
What are its weaknesses?
DIANA
It has no weaknesses!
A BOOM SOUNDS distantly.
A HALLWAY - THE ROOK
slams through a set of doors moving fast.
RESIDENCE - GARTH
stands, retrieves his rifle, the pack.
HALLWAY - THE ROOK
is running now, inexorable, unstoppable.
(SCENE) RESIDENCE & STAIRWELL - GARTH
moves quickly to within ten feet of the entrance to the
stairwell. The shoebox and Diana follow.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 81.

Garth retrieves several bricks of C-4 from the pack, tosses
the pack through the door, begins kneading the plastique
together.
DIANA
Run now! Do it! Leave!
Garth finishes kneading the C-4 into a glob the size of a
baseball, tucks it away in a pocket, brings the rifle up.
A BOOM SOUNDS, closer.
The Rook enters the residence at full run, already targeted
against Garth.
Garth brings the rifle within his sights and BEGINS FIRING at
full automatic.

Boom-boom-boom-boom! The pulse BOLTS STRIKE THE ROOK without
effect.
The Rook leaps obstacles and continues forward with
inexorable power.
Garth's pulse rifle empties.
The Rook hits Garth at full tilt, slaps the rifle away,
shoves him back, fingers reaching for Garth's throat.
Garth resists the creature's hands. His BODY ARMOR SPARKS as
it cycles toward depletion.
Momentum carries Garth through the doorway and into the
stairwell.
The Rook pushes Garth into the wall, fingers encircling his
neck, ARMOR SPARKING.
Garth struggles to bring his hand containing the C-4 up. The
plastique falls.
The compressive force of the Rook's hands begin to strangle
Garth through the armor.
Garth struggles, reaching for the C-4 on the ground. It's
inches away.
The Rook's red eyes bore into Garth, programed hatred.
Garth begins to gag.

Diana's eyes lock with Garth's. An empathy passes between
them impossible for the Rook to understand.
The shoebox accelerates into the C-4, sending it rolling into
Garth's hand.
Garth slaps the C-4 onto the Rook's back.
His other hand reaches for a battery in his beltpack.
Garth's BODY ARMOR WRIST READ-OUT: 33... 26... 19... 15...

Garth's fingers pull a battery from the beltpack.
The Rook's red eyes bore in.
Garth slaps the battery into the C-4.
A LIGHT WRENCHING EXPLOSION.

Garth pulls himself up to his elbows, checks his body armor.
INSERT - BODY ARMOR WRIST READ-OUT: 00.
GARTH
retrieves a battery from his belt, renews the body armor —
HUMMM — tries to stand, slips, finally reaches his feet.
GARTH
Where is it?
Diana gestures toward the end of the stairwell.
Garth staggers several steps in that direction, stops.
(SCENE) THE ROOK
pushes debris from his body and sits up.
Garth draws the two Smith and Wessons. By the time HE'S
FIRING the Rook is moving on him.
Garth retreats up the steps.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 83.

Its body armor blown, the Rook's chest RECEIVES THE BULLET
ROUNDS like darts through Playdough.
Garth EMPTIES THE PISTOLS, has no time to reload.
The Rook grabs Garth's ankles and crawls up his fallen body.
Garth plunges his damaged survival knife deep into the Rook's
bullet-pocked chest. No effect.
The Rook's hands close around Garth's neck.
Garth slams the knife repeatedly into the machine's body.
Nothing.
Beneath the Rook's flesh bio-mechanical devices ooze and
revolve, levers pushing limbs.
Garth's fingers reach for the railing, something to push
against, to rise. No.
The Rook's fingers close about Garth's neck.
Garth has lost control of the knife, which sticks from the
Rook's chest, its metal blade fostering sparks inside the
machine.
Garth grabs the knife handle, pulls, loses it, pulls again,
again, finally dislodging the knife.
The Rook squeezes Garth's neck, twisting, trying to wrench
his head from his body. Garth gags.
Garth's body armor wrist gauge reads 23... 17... 14... 09...
Garth raises the knife and plunges it deep into the Rook's
head.
The Rook's eyes go wide, then fail.
The Rook falls from Garth's body, tumbles down the steps,
bursts into flames.
GARTH
gasps for air, sucking oxygen into his lungs like water
through a busted dam. After several long moments he staggers
to his feet and descends the stairs, stepping carefully
around the Rook's burning torso.
Diana waits at the foot of the steps.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 84.

GARTH
Are there any more where he came from?
Diana looks at the carnage a moment before:
DIANA
None that are on line.
GARTH
Then I've defeated every security device?
DIANA
In the residence, there was only this
one...
Garth steps past her.
EXT. NIGHT - A BATTLEFIELD - MEN AND WOMEN
are advancing from debris hole to debris hole, weapons
readied, some FIRING, as EXPLOSIONS pound the earth around
them.
AT THE RAMPARTS - THE POLICE
among others are returning fire. Clearly, they are outgunned.
EXT. NIGHT - A PROMONTORY - REICH'S HELICOPTER
sits tied down against the wind. A man makes his way to the

Turning it down:

INT. NIGHT - THE RESIDENCE - VINCENT'S BED

nearby.
Diana's image seems to sit down beside him. After a moment of
recovery:
GARTH
You're on my side now, is that the idea?
DIANA
Is that all you've come to do, steal?
Garth considers the question a moment.
GARTH
Vincent was supposedly on the verge of a
discovery that would return the earth to
its original weather pattern. Do you know
anything about that?

No.
GARTH (CONT'D)
That secret is supposed to be contained
in Vincent's computer... in you.
DIANA
I'm not the computer. I just live in
it... But no, I'm not aware of anything
like that.
GARTH
Can you access the computer?
DIANA
There were things Mr. Vincent didn't want
me to know... business secrets,
accounting spreadsheets, his personal
correspondence. Other things.
Look.

GARTH
Diana's eyes shut. When they open:

DIANA
Nothing about any research on weather.
There are vast amounts of files that are

GARTH
Can you decrypt them?
Diana would rather not answer the question. She's
obfuscating:
DIANA
No... I can't.
GARTH
Maybe I can...
DIANA
No. You wouldn't stand a chance. Let me
take you to the earthquake supplies.
There must be a ton of food. It's located
in the subbasement.
Garth realizes that she's holding back. He stands, gathers
his equipment.
DIANA (CONT'D)
It's this way...
But Garth strides out in the opposite direction, deeper into
the residence.
WALK WITH GARTH

DIANA
You're going the wrong way.
Garth slams through the doors leading to a corridor.
On the left, the armory, behind locked doors.

Garth ignores her.
DIANA (CONT'D)
If you go in there you'll set off the

are massive. A sign reads: EnCrypt.
Garth drops his pack, removes the notebook computer, begins
picking the locks.
MINUTES LATER - THE DOORS
swing open.
Diana stands in Garth's way.
DIANA
Please... I'm begging you, don't...
Garth pushes through her.
THE COMPUTER ROOM IS VAST
A machine of a million parts, pulsing, alive, a sentient
thinking machine.
At its center is a couch preformed to accommodate the human

In it, THE CORPSE OF A MAN.

Garth approaches, stunned.

Diana looks away. Moments fall like broken glass to the
floor.

WHY?

GARTH (CONT'D)
(a shout)

DIANA
Over the months that he was a recluse
here, he... changed. I know why now. He
never told me about the collapse... out
there. He never said, "Diana, the world
is ending." I thought Mr. Vincent had
accepted the fact that I wasn't attracted
to him...
FLASHBACK: VINCENT'S LAB - VINCENT
sits working at a computer station, fingers rippling across
the keyboard. He stops.
DIANA PROJECTS nearby.
DIANA

Vincent turns to look at her appraisingly, foot to head.
VINCENT
There's just the two of us now, Diana...

Thoughts cascade through his mind and out onto his
expression. Finally:

Put it palm down on the scanner. The

Garth must twist Vincent's body out of the couch for the hand
to reach the nearby scanner.
A band of light reads the drawing.
A 3-D PROJECTION OF A COMPUTER SCREEN

Garth approaches the screen. Bars of light like venetian
blinds cross his features.

Do what?

VINCENT
PRAETOR
You damn well know what I mean. Diana

SMALL MASSES OF GOO AND ARE TRANSFORMED BY THEM. LASER BEAMS
CRISS-CROSS THE ROOM.
MOMENTS LATER
the final chopper crashes.
The final ghost falls from the air.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 99.

Silence.
AN AMOEBA
joins another. Then another. Then another.
THE CENTER OF THE RO0M
where the beast rejoins and rises into a mockery of a human
being, imperfect as Frankenstein's monster, ghastly.
COMPUTER ROOM - DIANA'S
eyes focus on the here and now.
I failed.

DIANA
VINCENT'S IMAGE
Now I know that Congress is busy
currently... Cities are burning...
there's rioting in the streets... but I
must demand an immediate response.
GARTH
I watched on the monitor.
DIANA
It's coming, John.
VINCENT'S IMAGE
I am prepared on notice of your
commitment to release a billion bioengineered seeds into the next passing
storm...
Garth turns back to the computer station.
GARTH
Did he release the seeds?
DIANA
I'm locked out. Release his data to me.
Here, input this command.
Large symbols appear in front of Vincent's projected face.
Garth inputs the code.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 100.

VINCENT'S IMAGE
I await your confirmation...
File names reel up past Vincent. THE FILES BEGIN TO OPEN, ARE
DISCARDED, ARE REPLACED BY OTHERS, COMPUTER FAST. DOCUMENTS,
FILMS, BLUEPRINTS.
DIANA
The seed pods are located on the roof...
They haven't been activated.
GARTH
The federal government collapsed before
it could respond... Why didn't he release
them?
Diana doesn't say.

WHY?

GARTH (CONT'D)
(a shout)

DIANA
Because the bastard wasn't paid!
GARTH
He allowed the world to be destroyed...
because he wasn't paid?
Diana's expression almost asks: He allowed me to die, didn't
he?
Yes!

DIANA
GARTH
Maybe there's something wrong with the
seeds. Check his data.
DIANA
John, the creature is approaching...
GARTH
I DON'T CARE!... Check the files.
Diana's eyes close. The HUM of the great computer's synaptic
circuits fills the room. ON THE PROJECTED SCREEN, file names
stream down at an unreadable rate. Graphs, blueprints,
representations of the new plant's DNA flicker into and out
of existence. Then:

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 101.

DIANA
According to the research, the new bioengineered plant should work as
advertised.
GARTH
Release the seeds! Now!
DIANA
John, the creature is just outside that
door.
Garth rushes the command console.
GARTH
I'll do it! Show me how!
Diana pulls her gaze away from the door just as its color
begins to change.
DIANA
I can't. It's a temporary device. Vincent
didn't integrate it with the rest of the
systems. You'll have to set it off
manually, from the roof.
THE DOOR
changes color, ripples, opens as it sags. The amoebic
globules that deteriorated the door reunite with the
creature.
COMPUTER ROOM (SCENE) - GARTH AND DIANA
react as the creature slithers/walks into the room. The
creature struggles to hold its human form, twisting,
undulating until... VINCENT'S EVIL GRIN appears on its face.
Startled, Diana almost screams.
Garth switches his rifle to full auto and sprays the amoeba,
causing it to splatter against the far wall.
GARTH
It was Vincent!
But Diana sees this awful creature for what it is.
DIANA
No... Vincent must have used a subset of
his own DNA to create it. Nothing that
(MORE)

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 102.

DIANA (cont'd)
small could carry the entire
consciousness of a human being.
The amoeba begins to reform, the splattered matter oozing
across the dark floor and down the distant walls to
reassemble.
GARTH
Diana — stairs to the roof?
DIANA
Far end of the room. Go!
Garth grabs his equipment, turns to leave:
GARTH
Shut off the surface to air missile
batteries on the roof.
Why?

DIANA
GARTH
Just do it!
Diana gestures assent. They share a brief moment eye-to-eye,
then Garth turns and rushes for the far reaches of the huge
room.
DIANA
turns to face the reforming creature. She disappears and the
shoebox rushes for the amorphous biomass slithering toward
her.
The shoebox slugs into the mass and is swallowed whole.
GARTH
slides to a stop beside the door, twists its knob, finds it
locked and jams his survival knife deep into the wood of the
jamb. It splinters.
Garth rises and slams through the door.
STAIRWELL - GARTH
reels through the door and up the stairs.
There is a another door at the next landing blocking his
path.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 103.

COMPUTER ROOM - THE AMOEBIC CREATURE
undulates toward the open door to the stairs, moving with
incredible speed.
STAIRWELL DOOR - GARTH
stabs his survival knife into the door, smashing the wood.
STAIRWELL LOWER LANDING - (SCENE) - THE CREATURE
oozes through the door... THEN SPURTS A PORTION OF ITSELF up
the well.
Where Garth has just slammed the door behind him.
The ooze lands on the door and begins to commingle with it.
STAIRWELL - GARTH
wedges the survival blade into the jamb, securing the door.
Garth quickly ascends the steps to the next landing.
Below, THE DOOR GARTH SECURED BEGINS TO WAFFLE, its
constituents weakened by contact with the creature. It sags
open and the creature enters.
AT THE NEXT LANDING - GARTH
blows the doorknob off the door just as A SMATTERING OF GOO
thrown from below SPLATTERS ONTO HIS BODY ARMOR WITH A HISS.
Garth ignores the goo and leaps through the door to the final
landing below the roof.
BELOW - THE MOTHER GOO
begins to "slinky" up the steps toward the gaping door.
THE NEXT LANDING - GARTH
staggers to a stop as the GOO SLIDES UP OVER HIS EYES.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 104.

CLOSE - GARTH'S EYES
reveal that the SPARKLING BODY ARMOR IS KEEPING THE GOO
INCHES AWAY from really contacting him.
RESUME GARTH
as he stabs his fingers through the goo, trying to remove it
from blocking his sight.
He reaches for a battery from his pack, finds the last one,
pulls it, SPITS ON ITS CONTACTS AND THEN RAMS IT INTO THE
GOO.
The GOO SHRIEKS AND LEAPS AWAY.
Garth pulls the hand radio from his pack.
GARTH
(radio)
Reich, come in.
EXT. THE CHOPPER LANDING SITE - NIGHT
Reich returns to the chopper to take the mike.
REICH
(radio)
Garth, go ahead.
INTERCUT WITH:
EXT. THE VINCENT ROOF - NIGHT
Garth leaps through the door onto the roof. The STORM IS
ALMOST UNBEARABLE. Above the noise of the wind:
GARTH
(radio)
Reich, bring your people in!
Reich throws LaPiere a 'I told you so' look.
REICH
Okay! Let's go! You heard the man.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 105.

GARTH
surveys the roof looking for the seeding devices.
GARTH'S POV - THE SEEDING DEVICES
are globes twenty feet across located at each corner of the
roof.
GARTH
moves for the closest globe as, in the distance, Reich's
chopper begins to wing in.
Garth opens the control panel.
INSERT - CONTROL PANEL
where a remote activation device is imbedded beside the
programing keys.
GARTH
takes the remote controller out, snaps it onto his belt, then
studies the seeding device controls as Reich's chopper lands
near the center of the roof.
Reich, LaPiere and six men with weapons exit the chopper.
REICH
You did it!
GARTH
The last defensive device is coming up
those stairs right now. Send your people
to take care of it.

Go!

REICH
(gesturing to LaPiere)
LaPiere and the six men move for the stairwell.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 106.

LAPIERE & THE SOLDIERS
slam open the stairwell door and fire on full automatic into
the pit. Once everyone has emptied one clip, they reload and
descend.
REICH OBSERVES GARTH
as he prepares to activate the controls.
REICH
What are you doing?
GARTH
You were right. Vincent developed a way
to fix the weather. I'm setting the
timers that will blow the roof and seed
the incoming storm.
Reich thinks about this a moment.
REICH
No shit? Reverse the weather?
INT. STAIRWELL - LAPIERE
allows the troops to take the point as they descend.
The lead trooper runs into THE AMEOBIC CREATURE, WHICH
ENVELOPES HIM. Blinded, his body armor sparking, the soldier
spins madly, screaming.
LAPIERE
Back off! Back off!
He and the remaining troops retreat up five steps.
EXT. ROOF - NIGHT
Reich watches Garth type in '5:00' in the timer.
REICH
What are you doing? You're not going to
activate it, are you?
GARTH
Of course I'm going to activate it.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 107.

REICH
Don't you realize what this is, you
idiot?! This is more than wealth — this
is power!
IN THE STAIRWELL - LAPIERE
and the remaining troops watch as the SOLDIER IS CONSUMED BY
THE AMOEBIC CREATURE. His skin turns powder-white before he
is spat out like a dust devil to the floor below.
LAPIERE
Kill it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
They OPEN FIRE, FULL AUTOMATIC.
ON THE ROOF - REICH AND GARTH
stare at one another, Garth's finger poised above the
activate button.
REICH
All I'm asking is... just think about
this a minute, will you?... We could evac
all this equipment up to the Central
Coast and set it off when the time is
right. We could... reunite the country.
Hell, the entire goddamn world.
GARTH
With you as emperor, I suppose?
Reich grins. Emperor is too strong a word...
Garth presses the 'activate' button, bringing this globe on
line.
IN THE STAIRWELL - LAPIERE
and his remaining men RETREAT UP THE STEPS AS THEY FIRE.
The ROUNDS SPLATTER THE CREATURE for seconds before it
reunites.
The creature FLINGS A PORTION OF ITSELF UP THE STAIRWELL,
CONNECTING WITH A SOLDIER. He screams in fear, the goo
beginning to eat through his body armor.
LaPiere reaches past his men to shove the wounded man at the
creature below, to buy time.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 108.

LAPIERE
(gesturing up)
Let's go, let's go!
ROOF - GARTH
runs for the next machine as Reich follows him, pleading.
REICH
Look, look... I'm not a greedy guy. We'll
do it your way. Any way you want.
GARTH
My way is now.
REICH
No! No, don't you see, there's no margin
in that. We can't use that.
Garth opens the next controller, taps the 'on' button, begins
to program.
STAIRWELL - LAPIERE
is the last to be slimed. Men below him are already burning,
being eaten by the goo flung by the mother creature.
LAPIERE
Goddamn it, goddamn it!
LaPiere peels the body armor belt off. The goo sticks to the
electromagnetic shield. LaPiere tosses it into the darkness
below and retreats up.
INTERIOR - AT THE ROOF DOOR - LAPIERE
is almost out the door when the amoebic CREATURE SLAPS ONTO
HIM, PULLING HIM BELOW. LaPiere begins to bellow and cry,
shrieking with fear.
ON THE ROOF - REICH
fires his automatic pistol at the sky, stopping Garth, who
turns slowly to face him.
REICH
Let's be reasonable... You're alone. I
have troops.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 109.

Garth's expression says, I wouldn't be so sure...
REICH (CONT'D)
I want to help mankind, too. Just like
you. But at the right time. If we set it
off now, no one can take credit, but if
we wait, spread the word, rally people to
our side, and then set it off — there's
no limit to how strong we can become.
No. Now.

GARTH
REICH
No. Later. When I say so.
Garth shakes his head 'no.'
REICH (CONT'D)
You're a tough nut, Major...
Something slaps Reich behind his head. What's that? Keeping
the weapon aimed at Garth, HE REACHES BACK WITH HIS LEFT
HAND, FEELS SOMETHING ON HIS SKIN, brings the fingers before
his eyes so he can see.
REICH (CONT'D)
What the hell?
Garth pivots and runs.
THIRD SEEDING DEVICE - GARTH
slides home, flips open the controller and begins tapping in
the activation delay. Behind him, in the distant background,
REICH SPINS MADLY, SCREAMING.
Garth activates the device, then stands.
Reich's VOICE GOES SUDDENLY SILENT.
Now there's only Garth and the creature left on the roof.
And one remaining pod to be programed.
Garth leaps into a run toward it.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 110.

RUN WITH GARTH
as he jumps cables and ventilators. In the distant, and then
less so distant background unidentified items are tossed into
the air as the creature approaches quickly.
Garth freezes.
THE CREATURE (SCENE)
slowly undulates up into a mound, then a miniature peak, then
a crude mimic of humanity, and finally into a monster of a
man. Vincent's awful face draws into a smile.
Garth draws the Smith and Wessons and BEGINS FIRING, leaping
away.
A PORTION OF THE CREATURE, JUST FLUNG, SPLATS against a roof
brace behind where Garth stood and slithers down.
The creature LOSES VISCOSITY AS THE STREAM OF BULLETS HITS IT
and it collapses.
Garth leaps across the puddle and runs on.
THE FOURTH POD - GARTH
drops to his knees, opens the control box and begins
programing the device.
A dark form rises behind him.
Garth accidentally programs in '50:00' rather than '5:00'.
Cursing:
GARTH
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
He must start all over again.
The form behind him is larger.
Finished, Garth stands. He notices the dark form behind him.
He turns.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 111.

REICH
stands there, HALF HIS BODY CHALK, SHAKING WITH THE CERTAINTY
OF HIS DEATH. He reaches out an arm at Garth but it falls,
like a cigarette ash, to the floor and disintegrates.
What remains of his living flesh turns chalk-white and
disintegrates TO REVEAL:
THE CREATURE
standing behind him.
Goo from REICH'S BODY DRIBBLES AWAY, THEN SCOOTS to the
Mother Goo.
GARTH
retreats a step, removes the remote control from his pocket,
presses the 'activate button' and tosses it into the
darkness.
INSERT - THE CONTROLLER PANELS
light up and begin a countdown from 5:00.
RESUME SCENE
as Garth takes a step to the left.
But the creature ignores him, looking instead toward the pod.
CREATURE'S POV - THE TIMER
continues to count down: 4:33... 4:32... 4:31... 4:30...
RESUME SCENE
as Garth waves his hands at the creature, trying to draw its
attention away from the pod.
GARTH
Hey! Hey! This way, slime ball!
The creature looks at him briefly, then moves for the pod.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 112.

The creature FLINGS A WAD OF ITSELF at the pod timer
mechanism.
The MECHANISM BEGINS TO CHANGE, darken, weaken.
GARTH
leaps to the pod, breaks a faceplate, stabs ACTIVATE NOW.
THE TIMER
goes from 4:17 to 10, then 9... 8... 7... 6...
GARTH
leaps away.
THE EXPLOSION
sends the pod ball high into the sky, where it BURSTS APART,
sending the seeds gusting high into the wind.
GARTH
runs for the next pod. He slides headfirst into the
mechanism, pops the cover open and breaks the face plate.
Finger on the ACTIVATE NOW button, Garth looks back over his
shoulder.
GARTH'S POV - THE CREATURE
undulates toward him like a shark smelling blood.
RESUME GARTH
as he presses the button and moves.
THE CREATURE
FLINGS ITSELF at the pod just as it EXPLODES.
The pod ball rises into the sky, repeating the previous
EXPLOSION.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 113.

GARTH
is running for the next pod when the flying goo SLAPS HIM ON
THE SHOULDERS and back. The goo causes the BODY ARMOR TO
SPARK.
Garth checks his wrist read-out:
INSERT - WRIST READ-OUT
reports 27... 24... 21...
GARTH
reaches for another battery in his belt. Empty.
Garth hits the buckle, snapping the armor loose, and throws
it aside, the GOO CLINGING TO IT as it falls away.
THIRD POD - GARTH
nearly falls over it, drops to a knee, opens the cover,
smashes the faceplate and presses the ACTIVATE NOW button.
The pod BLOWS just as Garth leaps away.
THE SEEDS
are whipped up and away by the stiffening wind.
GARTH
removes the last two clips for the pistols, loads one, then
the other.
He stares off across the roof.
GARTH'S POV - THE CREATURE
is making its way toward the final pod.
(SCENE) GARTH
draws the Smith-and-Wessons and advances.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 114.

Garth begins FIRING ON FULL AUTOMATIC as he runs.
The BULLETS DISPERSE THE CREATURE. Goo flies everywhere.
Garth reaches the pod first, opens the cover, smashes the
faceplate.
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CREATURE'S
amorphous tentacles grip Garth and pull him back.
His reaching hand is jerked away from the ACTIVATE NOW
button.
Garth bellows in pain as the GOO ABSORBS INTO HIS SKIN. White
blotches begin to appear.
Garth's boot catches a cable line and holds as the creature
pulls on his prone body.
Garth reaches for a pen in his pocket. It's the miniature
crossbow seen earlier. Arms spring out, a trigger. The bolt
snaps into place with a flick of his wrist. Garth aims...
aims... and fires.
THE POD CONTROLLER - THE ACTIVATE NOW BUTTON
is pressed home by the flying bolt.
GARTH AND THE CREATURE
are blown back by the explosion.
Garth lands ten feet away. The GOO IS SLOWLY PROCEEDING UP
ONE ARM, changing his flesh, killing it. Garth rubs it, as if
to return circulation, but it doesn't help.
Garth sees the creature reforming, moving toward him. He
tries to move but he's been hurt far more than he thought. He
sags, waiting death.
A DAMAGED ROBOT
from an earlier confrontation with the creature surges
forward. In its hands, a cable whose end has been stripped,
revealing naked wires. The robot spears the creature with the
cable. SPARKS AND SIZZLING FLESH. Moments pass as the
CREATURE CONTINUES TO LOSE VISCOSITY, sagging finally into
bags of amorphous jelly, and then decayed pools of chemicals.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 115.

Diana APPEARS, imperfectly due to damaged projector lenses,
on top of the robot, which drops the cable.
DIANA
Are you all right?
GARTH
(coughing)
I'm dying.
DIANA
No you're not. I can save you.
GARTH
(laughs - bubbling blood)
No. I don't think so.
The robot scoops him up, pivots and moves for the stairwell
door, DIANA PROJECTED ON TOP and seeming to tend to Garth.
THE TRACKS OF THE ROBOT
pass over puddles of ooze, which cling.
EXT./INT. THE STAIRWELL - (SCENE)
The robot carrying Garth, crazily descends the steps,
dropping from step to step.
Smashes through the second landing door.
Crashes through the third.
Careens around the corner and through the final door.
THE ROBOT'S TRACKS
are beginning to SMOKE AND HISS as the creature transforms
the metal.
GARTH AND DIANA
almost tumble from the robot as it throws a track and grinds
to a halt.
Garth's left arm is almost ash.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 116.

DIANA
You must get up!... Get up!... Get up,
goddamn it! GET UP!
Garth is almost out. He looks questioningly at Diana, as if
to ask, Why?
DIANA (CONT'D)
Get to the computer! John, listen to me,
you can still live... if you just get to
the computer!
Garth understands. He tries to lift himself from the robot's
arms, falls back, tries again.
Garth tumbles to the floor, tries to stand but his LEFT LEG
HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO WASTE MATERIAL. No living flesh there.
DIANA (CONT'D)
Focus, John! Focus on me. You can do it.
DIANA'S IMAGE FLICKERS in the darkness, a wavering ghost. She
is tethered to the damaged robot, unable to go with him.
Garth begins to crawl.
DIANA DISAPPEARS FROM THE ROBOT and REAPPEARS, A BETTER
PROJECTION, near the computer where Vincent's lifeless body
lays.
DIANA (CONT'D)
Fifteen feet, John. That's all it is.
Just fifteen feet.
(SCENE) THE CREATURE
surges through the door.
Diana snaps around to look, as does Garth.
The creature too is not what it once was. The beast fights to
retain its form and motion, but moves forward.
Garth tries to crawl faster, but can't.
DIANA DISAPPEARS from the computer, and REAPPEARS at the
robot. Standing on its top, she directs it to turn around.
The remaining track spins the machine around.
Garth forces himself to go faster.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 117.

Diana commands the robot's arms to snap menacingly. This is
the only weapon that remains.
The creature advances.
Garth uses furniture to pull himself forward. He's on his
knees now.
The robot's arms snap as the creature advances.
The robot and creature meet. The snapping arms are
meaningless. The CREATURE SWALLOWS THE ROBOT as DIANA'S IMAGE
WAVERS, CRACKLES, AND DISAPPEARS.
(SCENE) DIANA
REAPPEARS beside the computer.
She watches with mute horror as the creature absorbs the
robot, rises to its full height, and then FLINGS A PORTION OF
ITS MASS AT GARTH.
The GOO HITS GARTH just as he rises to push Vincent's body
from the couch. The body topples onto the floor as Garth
screams in pain.
The GOO SETTLES INTO HIS BACK, sizzling.
Garth loses control of his body, collapses to the floor.
Portions of his back, waist, one leg, one arm are already
lifeless.
DIANA
I can't do this for you! You must get up
onto the couch! Now! NOW!
Garth shakes the grogginess away as A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS
HIM.
(SCENE) THE CREATURE,
its mass increased by conquest, has risen to its full height
less than five feet away.
Garth rises on one leg as the other drops away from his body,
a fallen cigarette ash.
One last Herculean effort, Garth jumps up onto the couch.
The CREATURE FALLS UPON HIM, swallowing him whole.

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 118.

Diana gasps in surprise and regret.
Garth's GOOD HAND JUTS UP THROUGH THE GOO, pulls the temple
probe down to where his forehead is located beneath the
creature.
The vast computer's HUM increases.
The outline of Garth's body jumps, then shakes in death
rattle.
Diana throws the full power of EnCrypt into the chair making
contact with the amoebic goo. EnCrypt's dormant synaptic
power rises to a terrible HUM. The creature fries, this time
not dissolving but burning. Pieces fly away, ashes fallen
from a bonfire. A BELLOWING MOAN rises from the creature as
it crumbles into hot dust.
SLOW DISSOLVE:
EXT. A MEADOW ABOVE THE OCEAN - DAY
Wild flowers are in bloom. The sea wind gusts gently.
Garth stands staring out to sea. He wears casual clothes,
clean, carefree.
A hand reaches out for him. Garth takes it.
PULL BACK to reveal Diana. Wearing a sun dress and holding a
hat on her head against the wind. She smiles.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL that this is a television screen in the
EnCrypt computer room.
PULL BACK TO THE CEILING... THROUGH THE CEILING... THEN THE
NEXT, AND THE NEXT... TO THE ROOF... TO THE SKY, WHERE THE
STORM IS RAGING AND THE POD SEEDS ARE SWIRLING... ABOVE THE
STORM...
PULL BACK TO THE EARTH ITSELF, SPINNING ON.
FADE OUT:
THE END
