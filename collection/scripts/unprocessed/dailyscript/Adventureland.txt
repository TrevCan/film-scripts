LIVING ROOM, OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - NIGHT

WE’RE CLOSE ON THE FACE OF
JAMES BRENNAN, 22. He’s gazing at someone off-screen, eyes
filled with longing.
THERE’S NO SOUND. Behind him, OUT OF FOCUS, college kids at
a rollicking party...
THE SOUND FADES IN SLOWLY
Shouted, drunken conversation competes with a stereo blasting
“Bastards of Young” by The Replacements. A couple wear
graduation mortarboards.

Hey, you want to get out of hereARLENE
(hasn’t heard him)
What a rager, huh?
JAMES
Yeah. Yeah.
(beat)
Isn’t it weird? That this all...this
happened right at the end of the
semester? You and...me.
She finally looks at him.
JAMES (CONT’D)
And we’ll both be in Manhattan come
September.
(beat)
I’m really...fond of you.
ARLENE
You’re sweet.

James.
Yeah?

ARLENE
I don’t think I can see you anymore.

She sighs heavily and looks away. James watches her, waiting
for more of an explanation. Instead:

sorry.
She walks away.

KITCHEN, OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - LATER

James stands with two friends, ERIC (unkempt and shaggyhaired, yet radiates a casual air of privilege) and BRAD,
who’s mixing a drink from the dregs of whatever liquor
bottles he can find.
ERIC
Women are mercurial, man.
BRAD
You did just start dating last week.
JAMES
I know, but...I thought that she got
me...
ERIC
You didn’t tell her about the
‘scarlet V’?
JAMES
That has nothing...
You did.

ERIC
Brennan, you promised me!

JAMES
Look, I don’t lie to people I care about.
ERIC
But you could’ve just left it out of the
narrative! You don’t want ‘virgin’ to be
your signifier!
JAMES
Jesus, he takes one semiotics class...
Brad hands the ‘cocktail’ to James.

Cocktail hour in the Brennan household. COUNT BASIE swings

off a frozen daiquiri, preparing another. MRS. BRENNAN sips
white wine, while reading a paperback copy of “Iacocca: An

Now what do you want for dinner? I can

Wow.

JAMES
I, uh-

MRS. BRENNAN
(crossing to the fridge)
...or leftover lamb stew.
JAMES
Any of that soundsMRS. BRENNAN
And I even got that frozen manicotti, the
kind you like.
MR. BRENNAN
He loves that.
JAMES
Sure. Let’s have that. So...the trip is
going to cost a tiny bit more than we
discussed.
MRS. BRENNAN
What are we talking about?
JAMES
Um, my Europe trip? So my original
estimate for the whole trip was 1,568
dollars. But I’ve researched more youth
hostels and the median cost is a bit
higher than I thought, by seven dollars
and sixty-eight cents, multiplied by
forty-two days is $322.56. But the good
news is I still qualify for a student
eurail pass, which saves us $143.45. But
I also think my emergency fund is
unrealistic at $100, I should make it
$150. So, with the 768 dollars I have
from grandma’s trust fund, plus the 800
you guys are already giving me, I will
need another 229 dollars and eleven
cents. It makes the total for you guys
1,029 dollars and eleven cents.
MRS. BRENNAN
One-thousand and twenty-nine dollars.
MR. BRENNAN
And eleven cents.
Silence.

James’s parents exchange a look.

James, your father has been transferred

That’s great-

MRS. BRENNAN
It’s not a better department. We’ll be
making less money. Considerably less.
JAMES
Wh...what happened?
MR. BRENNAN
It’s not a big deal, they just, they
reorganized a bit. It’s temporary.
MRS. BRENNAN
We hope. I’m sorry, honey, I know we
said we thought we could help with your
trip. We can’t.
JAMES
But it’s my graduation present.
MRS. BRENNAN
I know, but we don’t have it. We can’t
spare a penny for Europe. And we can’t
spare a penny for grad school, either.

If you decide you really want to go to

MRS. BRENNAN
If you want to eventually move into the

A summer job?
MRS. BRENNAN
Better start looking. Most of the good
ones are grabbed up. Here.
Mrs. Brennan hands James the classified ads. James stares at
the paper as if there’s a dead fish in it. Mr. Brennan
starts the blender -- but he hasn’t affixed the lid properly.
The blender sprays daiquiri all over a cabinet.
MR. BRENNAN
Whoa, Nelly!

RESTAURANT - DAY

James, dorky in a button-down shirt and knit tie, stands in
front of a RESTAURANT MANAGER, handing him documents.
JAMES
I really haven’t had many jobs, per se...
But here’s my academic record and my
extracurricular activities. I wrote for
the literary journal, ‘The Gordian Knot’.
And in high school, I got a 750 on the
math SATs, so I’d be good at tabulating
checksRESTAURANT MANAGER
These are the only jobs you’ve had?

James is mowing his parents’ lawn, a look of self-pity on his

James turns for a second. Frigo wallops him directly in the
privates. James falls to the lawn, moaning.
JAMES
I’m going to fucking kill you, Frigo...
Frigo hops back on his bike.

Frigo pedals away, cackling maniacally. We see that he’s
once again wearing his orange ‘Adventureland’ shirt.

RIVERSIDE DRIVE, MANHATTAN - DAY

James and Eric stroll down the sidewalk. Eric wears his
“bohemian uniform”: painter’s pants, tie-dyed shirt, shell
necklace and a kerchief over his head. James glances around
anxiously as Eric brazenly smokes a joint.
ERIC
Home all summer.
Fuckin’ harsh.

On Long Island.

JAMES
It’s a nightmare. I mean, I’m a
romantic! I actually read poetry for
pleasure. Out where I grew up, if I tell
someone that, they’ll beat me to death
with a table leg.

You still thinking about graduate school?
Yeah.

Total mistake. What do you need another
degree for? Did Henry Miller need a

JAMES
Actually, Beckett went to Trinity College
and after that he was an assistant for
James Joyce. Which is a story I always
wanted to turn into a two-character playERIC
Yeah, shut up, my point is -- you don’t
come from money. Graduate school’s gonna
require massive loans. Three more years
of school, then, what, a decade or two of
paying them off? Why not blow your
brains out now?
JAMES
But if something’s worth doing...
ERIC
Take some time to picture the narrative
of your life. Needing it or wanting
money is the fundamental trap of
humankind.
(putting a hand on James’s
shoulder)
Look, I want you to know you’ll be with
me in spirit this summer. Take this...

From a coat pocket, Eric produces a baggie that contains
several thin, poorly-rolled joints.

But, you know...I get a little crazyTake it.

James nervously jams the bag into his pocket.
ERIC
You think you don’t like weed.

You will.

JAMES
(worried, won’t drop it)
But how am I going to break into
journalism if I don’t go to grad school?
ERIC
Brennan, you’ll be with me! In a few
short months we’ll be in New York City.
We’ll be living the adventure together!

James rolls into a large parking lot, passing under an arched
sign that reads “ADVENTURELAND”. A gangly young man (RICH)
approaches him. He uses a yellow plastic wiffle ball bat to
direct traffic.
RICH
Right here, sir!

Right here!

Rich waves James toward a bicycle rack.
“Parking Captain”.

Rich’s shirt reads:

We are greeted by a cacophony of pinball, skee ball, air

James now wears a light blue t-shirt -- stacked in descending
size, it reads: “Games, Games, Games, Games”. He stands

hair and some scraggly chin growth.

Joel is marching James up the midway. We get our first good
look at “Adventureland” -- it’s a ramshackle place, a lot
closer to Coney Island than to Disney World.
“Rock Me Amadeus” by Falco echoes across the park (top forty
radio plays loudly all day long, every day).

Joel and James are at the ubiquitous carnival game wherein
contestants squirt water into a plastic clown-head’s mouth,
inflating a balloon until it pops.
JOEL
The trick here: you’ve got a better
chance of winning if you pick a clown
with a new balloon. The old balloons
have already been stretched out. Less
likely to pop. You can share this info
with cute girls at your discretion.

I appreciate that.

Joel and James are approaching another game booth.
JOEL
This game is inexplicably called “The
Flying Dutchman”. Even more inexplicable
is how they decided to spell it. Morons.
The sign reads: “THE FLIGHING DUTCHMAN!”
They enter the game, which is a platform with forty or so
large milk bottles. Very large stuffed panda bears are
dangling over them.
JOEL
One dollar buys five rings. If the ring
lands on one of the red bottles, they win
one of these giant-ass pandas.
JAMES
That is a giant-ass panda.
JOEL
It’s the best prize in the park.
And
that’s because this game is unwinnable.
Observe. I’ll drop the ring from three
inches away.
Joel holds a plastic ring right above a bottle.
The ring bounces off.

He drops it.

JAMES
Nobody ever wins?
JOEL
If they do, it’s because you weren’t
being vigilant and they reached over and
placed the ring on the bottle. Someone
wins a giant-ass panda bear on your
watch? Go home, you’re fired.

“THE FLIGHING DUTCHMAN!” BOOTH, ADVENTURELAND - DUSK

It’s the hour when the park starts getting overrun with
teenagers and young adults. Blaring from the many
loudspeakers is “Something About You” by Level 42.
James’s booth is getting crowded. A hyperactive guy in a
faded MOLLY HATCHET T-SHIRT is demanding his attention:
Yo!

Guy!

MOLLY HATCHET T-SHIRT
How many rings for a ticket?

Five per ticket.
MOLLY HATCHET T-SHIRT

James notices that the customer’s eyes are darting to
something behind him. Just as James turns to look, he sees a
DRUNK DAD (wearing a Scorpions concert tee) holding his sixyear-old child over the milk bottles. The boy places a ring
on a red bottle and the man quickly pulls him back.
DRUNK DAD

He won! Check it out! Look, my kid won!
Check it out! Awright, Dom!

nickname, short for “Munchkin”). He shrugs.
JAMES

The dad shows James a hunting knife he’s concealing by his

Well, I need to do some work before bed.
Good-night.

So it was a lovely party at the Melnicks.
They’ve done a beautiful job on their

pergola. Just gorgeous.

Their daughter, Lori, is lovely. She
said you two used to be best friends?!

In junior high.
How nice.

She used to sleep over.

EM (to James)
Lori Melnick once violated our cat,
Gypsy, with a ballpoint pen.
Emily!

FRANCY

EM
She was just, like, ‘hey, check this out’

kinda weird. Does that make me an
accessory to cat rape?

THE PHOTO -- a snapshot of Em in her Buzzcocks t-shirt,

JAMES

He gets up and crosses to a shelf that displays a few

“KENTUCKY DERBY” GAME, ADVENTURELAND - NIGHT

James is WILDLY, CRAZILY STONED. He’s calling a race for a
group of small children who are completely inept -- nobody’s
horse is making any progress.
JAMES
And red has a slight lead. Yeah.
Uhhh...and red still has a slight lead.
Looks like blue is...not moving. Looks
like nobody’s moving. Time is
frozen...like a prehistoric insect,

He trails off.

His eyes wander around the vicinity...

He lifts the microphone quickly -- it flies out of his hand.
JAMES
(retrieving the microphone)
And what a race we have here today,
ladies and gentleman! Hoo boy!
And...nobody is in the lead! In fact,
what is so mind-blowing about this
particular race is how evenly matched
these competitors are. Yellow is dead
last. I don’t think Yellow has moved
once. This is a fall from grace for the
this once-great stallion. In fact,
Yellow has inseminated over a thousand
foals in his lifetime...which might
explain his exhaustion. Ha ha...
James realizes that Bobby is now right beside him.

Nicky launches another pitch toward James.
Trying to evade the throw, James runs smack into one of the

Nicky and his friends howl with laughter. Then Nicky notices
something odd -- the dummy is still wearing a hat.

song and some guy from their group comes
up to me and asks, is it okay if Neil
sits in for a few?
PRETTIEST GIRL
(all she can say)
...Holy shit! Holy shit!...
CONNELL
So Neil comes up on the stage. We shake
hands. Just say hello and shit. Puts on
a guitar. And we did a whole fucking set
of his songs. We did ‘Southern
Man’...‘Cinnamon Girl’...‘My My, Hey
Hey’...‘Corvette Killer’...‘Like a
Hurricane’...
GIRLS
(simultaneously)
...Oh my God!...What a pisser!...Holy
shit!...
Connell grins.

Then he notices James standing nearby.

CONNELL (TO JAMES)
Hey, I want to talk to you.
(to the girls)
Ladies, hold on a sec.
Connell crosses to James.

He lowers his voice.

CONNELL
You’re fucking lucky. The whole thing’s
blown over. Ronnie’s calmed down.
Mostly.
JAMES
Well. I’m glad... How’s Em?
if she’s okay?

Do you know

CONNELL
Em? She’s young and pretty, she comes
from money. I think she’ll be okay.
Beat.

James gets an agitated look.
JAMES
It’s Cortez the Killer.
What?

CONNELL

JAMES
It’s not ‘Corvette Killer’. The Neil
Young song is ‘Cortez the Killer’.
Cortez. He was a Spanish conqueror.
Overthrew the Aztecs.
Connell looks tongue-tied. James turns and walks away,
passing by Bobby, who is singing along with the music:
BOBBY
(mangling the lyrics)
Mama used to say, take your tie off, man!
Mama used to say, don’t you brush to get
gold! Mama used to say(sees James)
Hey, Brennan!
Hi, Bobby.

JAMES
How are you?

BOBBY
Ah, you know, it’s Labor Day weekend.
The season’s almost over...
(really getting wistful)
I always get kinda sad, y’know? I guess
there’s always gonna be that part of me
that thinks of summer as this magical
time, you know what I mean? Anyway,
you’re a good kid, Brennan. I hope it
all worksSUDDENLY
a fair amount vomit comes pouring down on Bobby.

EXT.

BOULEVARD NEAR ADVENTURELAND - A BIT LATER

Mr. Brennan’s car rolls up to a traffic light and stops.
James is looking out the window.
ON THE CORNER
a rusty old Dodge Dart has just pulled over. And Joel is
getting out of it, looking furtive, not wanting to be
associated with his father and his battered car.
JAMES
(to Mr. Brennan)
Um. Wait for me at the corner.
James hops out of the car.

The Dart sputters away as Joel

JAMES
(jogging across the street)
Hey! Joel!
Joel turns around.
Oh.

Hey.

He’s wearing his “games” shirt.
JOEL

JAMES
You’re back.
JOEL
Yeah. Cash flow problems.

I heard about all the shit that went

JAMES
Fucked up my dad’s car.
I made this summer.

Well. We’re both losers then.

Joel nods, then heads down the sidewalk, toward the park.

INT.

BACKYARD, BRENNAN HOUSE - LATER, EARLY EVENING

172

James stands in his backyard, taking in the evening.
A PIERCING WHISTLE
echoes from a field behind his house. James sees a few
bottle rockets shoot into the sky. He climbs over the fence
and heads toward the group of young men shooting the
fireworks. Frigo runs toward James:
FRIGO
Brennan! We stole a case of Schlitz from
Zeblisky’s garage!!

Frigo runs around with a roman candle, pointing it like a

James, sitting under a tree,

He lies on the ground, staring up. He watches an errant
bottle rocket ricochet into the branches above his head.

THERE IS NO SOUND.

WE’RE WATCHING EM, from James’s P.O.V., as she rides the
roller coaster at Adventureland. She’s feigning boredom as
the ride swoops and dips recklessly behind her.
MORE QUICK CUTS OF OTHER IMAGES OF EM:
-

At Danny’s Bar, giving the camera a devilish look as she
throws back a shot of bourbon

-

A moment at a game booth, where Em turns away from an
irritating customer and shoots us a “save me from this
hell” look

-

Looking at James, sitting on the hood of her car, at the
beach at night, her eyes filled with sadness and fear

-

Driving in her car, at dusk, singing along with the radio

-

In her pool, at night, staring at us

JAMES’S DAYDREAMING
is broken by Frigo, who stands over him:
FRIGO
Don’t fall asleep, Brennan.
Why?

JAMES

FRIGO
Cause I’ll jack off on your face.
Frigo giggles like a lunatic.
JAMES
What on earth is wrong with you?
James stands up.

He’s come to a decision:

JAMES
Look, can you get your mom’s car again?
Right now? I’ll give you twenty bucks.
Thirty.
Fine.
Forty.

FRIGO
JAMES

James shakes his head. He gets out his wallet, removes two
twenties and hands them over.

As Frigo goes to pocket the cash, James slugs him in the

FRIGO’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Once again, Frigo is behind the wheel of his mother’s Cutlass
as James pushes the car out of the driveway.
175

EXT.

SUBURBAN STREET/LEWIN HOUSE - LATER

175

The Cutlass rumbles down a street. As they approach Em’s
house, they see that there are a few cars in the driveway and
several more parked on the street.
Huh.

JAMES

Frigo stops the car.
FRIGO
I’ll wait for you.
No, don’t.
Beat.

JAMES

Frigo looks sympathetically at James.
FRIGO
Hope it works out.
JAMES
(surprised & a little touched)
Thanks, Frigo.

James, surprised and a little touched by Frigo, gets out of
the car and crosses toward the front door. He rings the
bell. He turns back toward Frigo. He’s not in the car -instead, he’s over on the side of Em’s lawn, urinating on a
tree.
FRIGO
I can’t hold it!
James hears the door open and turns back. Em stands there.
Behind her we can hear an adult cocktail party in progress.
Em stares at James, tongue-tied.
JAMES
Hey, I wanted to talk to you.

James enters the room. Em follows, shutting the door.
look at each other for an awkward beat.
EM
This is pretty weird.
JAMES
Yeah.
(beat)
Look. I’m here to apologize. First of
all, I’m sorry I hung up on you that day.
Worse, it’s my fault everyone found out
about you and Connell. I told Lisa P.
And...while you and I were seeing each
other...I went on a date with Lisa P.
Nothing really happened. We kissed a
little. But I...I don’t know...I feel
bad about that.
EM
I heard you guys went out.
You did?

JAMES
You never said anything.

EM
(looking down)
What could I say?
(beat)
I’m sorry if I hurt you. I...I don’t
know what’s wrong with me.

JAMES
The only thing wrong is that you need to
find someone you can trust.
She looks up at him for a long beat.

Em moves to James. She pulls his shirt off. He leans
forward and kisses her. Without abandoning her lips, he
slides off her t-shirt. They kick off their shoes, pull off
socks, then help each other out of their pants. Em takes off
her bra. They both slide off their underwear.
They stand facing each other, naked. Their eyes are nervous
and searching. James caresses her cheek and smiles. Em
laughs, blinking away a few tears.
We hold on them for a long moment.

EXT.

MIDWAY, ADVENTURELAND - DUSK

It’s right after sunup.

Nobody is here yet.

IN SEPARATE SHOTS, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM THESE THINGS:
The empty midway; a rusty cotton candy vending cart; the
snack bar menu sign that hasn’t changed for years and is
missing letters; the dark and silent video arcade; the “Bimbo
the Clown” machine, with an “OUT OF ORDER” sign; the
moronically grinning “Hats Off To Larry” mannequin; racks of
stuffed “bananas with eyes”; empty Chopper ride gondolas,
creaking and swaying...
WE END ON A SHOT THAT CRANES INTO THE AIR, showing a wide
view of the shabby little park. A desolate wind blows
through Adventureland. Another summer’s almost over.
END CREDITS OVER “Ever Fallen In Love” by The Buzzcocks.
