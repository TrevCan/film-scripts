1944

FADE IN:
1.

EXT. STERNWOOD PLACE - ESTABLISHING SCENE
It is a millionaire's house, big, sprawling, California
style, with clipped lawns and gardens, on a hill above the
now abandoned oil field which was the family's wealth. A
small coupe drives up to the door and stops, and Philip
Marlowe gets out. We just have time to establish him as he
approaches the door -- a husky, self-confident man, welldressed but not flashy.

STERNWOOD

3.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE
as NORRIS opens the door. Norris is thin, silver-haired
with a gentle intelligent face.
NORRIS
(holding the door)
Good morning, sir.
MARLOWE
I'm Philip Marlowe. General
Sternwood sent for me.
NORRIS
(opens door,
steps aside)
Yes, Mr. Marlowe. Will you
come in?
MARLOWE
(entering)
Thanks.

4.

INT. FORMAL MALL - SAME OPULENT BIG-SCALE STYLE - MARLOWE
as Norris shuts the door, takes Marlowe's hat.
NORRIS
Will you sit here? I'll tell
the General you have come.
MARLOWE
Okay.

2.
Norris exits. Marlowe looks about, interested and curious,
sees something, moves toward it.
5.

CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE
as he stands before a portrait, examining it with curious
interest. It is a portrait of General Sternwood, in
regimentals, beneath crossed battle-torn cavalry pennons
and a sabre. He is still staring at the portrait when at a
SOUND OFF, he turns and sees CARMEN STERNWOOD approaching.
She is about 20, in slacks, something sullen and hot about
her. She stops about 10 feet from him and stares at him,
biting the thumb of her left hand.
MARLOWE
Good morning.
CARMEN
(after a moment)
You're not very tall are you?
MARLOWE
I tried to be.
CARMEN
Not bad looking, though -- you
probably know it.
MARLOWE
Thanks.
He goes to a chair and sits down. When he looks up, he
sees Carmen approaching, still staring at him.
CARMEN
(approaching)
What's your name?
MARLOWE
Reilly -- Doghouse Reilly.
CARMEN
(beside the chair now)
That's a funny name. Are you a prize
fighter?
No.

MARLOWE
I'm a shamus.
CARMEN

A what?
MARLOWE
A private detective.

3.
CARMEN
You're cute.
As she speaks, she sits suddenly on the arm of his chair.
As she does so, Marlowe rises, shifts the chair in doing
so, so that to her surprise, Carmen finds herself sitting
in the chair itself. She stares up, surprised and then
angrily, is about to speak again when they both see Norris.
He has just entered noiselessly, stands beside the chair.
On Norris' face there is now a curious expression of grief,
sadness. Carmen glances up at him, rises quickly as if he
had reprimanded her with words, and exits. Marlowe looks
after her, thoughtful, a little grim.
NORRIS
The General will see you now.
MARLOWE
(looking after Carmen)
Who was that?
NORRIS
Miss Carmen Sternwood, sir.
MARLOWE
You ought to wean her.
old enough.
Yes, sir.

She looks

NORRIS
This way, if you please.

They exit through French doors.
6.

EXT. REAR LAWN - SAME WEALTHY SCALE
Garage at one side, beyond it a tremendous greenhouse.
Norris is leading Marlowe along the path toward the green
house. A chauffeur is washing a car before the garage. We
establish him in passing -- a handsome, boyish-looking man,
OWEN TAYLOR.
Marlowe follows Norris on to the greenhouse, looking at the
tremendous size of it as Norris opens the door and stands
aside for Marlowe to enter.

7.

INT. GREENHOUSE CHOKED WITH ORCHID PLANTS
Marlowe, following Norris between the crowding tendrils and
branches. The place is oven-hot, damp with sweat, green
with gloom. Marlowe is already reacting to it, is already
mopping his face with his handkerchief.

4.
MARLOWE
(mopping neck,
following Norris)
Couldn't we have gone around this?
NORRIS
(over shoulder;
walking on)
The General sits in here, sir.
8.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL STERNWOOD
in a wheelchair in center of the greenhouse, in a cleared
space about which the plants crowd and hover. The GENERAL
is the man we saw in the portrait, though older, and
obviously dying, so that only his fierce eyes seem to have
any life. Even in the terrific heat his body is wrapped in
a traveling rug and a heavy bathrobe, his gnarled hands
lying like dead gnarled twigs on the rug, his fierce eyes
following as Norris leads Marlowe in.
NORRIS
(stopping)
This is Mr. Marlowe, General.
The General does not speak, only the fierce eyes stare at
Marlowe as Norris pushes a wicker chair up behind Marlowe's
legs.
STERNWOOD
Brandy, Norris.
(to Marlowe)
How do you like your brandy, sir?
MARLOWE
(sitting down)
Just with brandy.
Norris takes Marlowe's hat, exits.
STERNWOOD
I used to like mine with champagne.
The champagne cold as Valley Forge
and about three ponies of brandy
under it. You may take your coat
off, sir.
MARLOWE
Thanks.
He rises, removes his coat, takes out his handkerchief,
hangs his coat on chair.

5.
STERNWOOD
(watching him)
It's too hot in here for any man
who still has blood in his veins.
Marlowe sits again, mops his face and neck.
STERNWOOD
(still watching him)
You may smoke too. I can still
enjoy the smell of it, anyway.
MARLOWE
Thanks.
He produces a cigarette, lights it, blows smoke, Sternwood's
nostrils moving as he sniffs the smoke. Norris enters,
pushing a teawagon bearing decanter, siphon, initialed
ice-bucket.
STERNWOOD
That man is already dead who must
indulge his own vices by proxy.
Norris wheels the wagon up, starts to prepare a drink.
STERNWOOD
(watching pettishly)
Come, man. Pour a decent one.
NORRIS
(adding brandy)
Yes, General.
MARLOWE
(watching)
But not too decent, Norris. I don't
want to exchange places with it.
Norris adds soda, hands glass to Marlowe.
MARLOWE
(taking glass)
Thanks.
He sits back. Norris covers the ice-bucket with a napkin,
exits. SOUND of DOOR CLOSING as Norris leaves the
greenhouse. Marlowe raises the glass, sips. Sternwood
watches him, licks his lips with longing pleasure and
enjoyment. Marlowe lowers the glass.
STERNWOOD
Tell me about yourself, Mr. Marlowe.
I suppose I have the right to ask.

6.
MARLOWE
There's not much to tell. I'm
thirty-eight years old, went to
college once. I can still speak
English when there's any demand for
it in my business. I worked for the
District Attorney's office once. It
was Bernie Ohls, his chief
investigator, who sent me word you
wanted to see me. I'm not married.
STERNWOOD
You didn't like working for Mr.
Wilde?
MARLOWE
I was fired for insubordination
I seem to rate pretty high on that.
STERNWOOD
I always did, myself. Sir -(he slides one
hand under the
rug on his knees)
What do you know about my family,
Mr. Marlowe?
MARLOWE
(mopping)
You're a widower, a millionaire, two
young daughters. One unmarried, the
other married once but it didn't
didn't take. Both now living with
you and both -(he breaks off;
the General's
fierce eyes
watch him)
STERNWOOD
Go on.
MARLOWE
Am I to swap you gossip for
hospitality?
STERNWOOD
(sternly)
You are to swap me your confidence
for my own.

7.
MARLOWE
(shrugs)
All right. Both pretty, and both
pretty -- wild. What did you want
to see me about?
STERNWOOD
I'm being blackmailed again.
MARLOWE
(mopping)
Again?
STERNWOOD
(draws his hand
out from under
the rug, holding
a brown envelope)
About a year ago I paid a man named
Joe Brody five thousand dollars
to let my younger daughter alone.
MARLOWE
Ah.
STERNWOOD
What does that mean?
MARLOWE
It means 'ah.' It never went
through the D.A.'s office, or I'd
have known it. Who handled that for
you?
STERNWOOD
Shawn Regan did.
MARLOWE
(alternating between
the drink, the
cigarette and
the now sodden
handkerchief with
which he mops his
face and neck)
There must be some reason why Regan's
not handling this one too. Am I to
know it?
STERNWOOD
Shawn has left me.

8.
MARLOWE
I thought I hadn't seen him around
lately.
STERNWOOD
Yes, he left about a month ago,
without a word. That was what hurt.
I had no claim on him, since I was
only his employer. But I hoped we
were more than that and that he
would have said goodbye to me. You
knew him too?
MARLOWE
Yes. From the old days, when he
was running rum from Mexico and
I was on the other side, and now
and then we swapped shots between
drinks -- or drinks between shots,
if you like that better.
STERNWOOD
My respects to you. Few men ever
exchange more than one shot with
Shawn Regan. He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army, you
know.
MARLOWE
(mopping)
No, I didn't. But I knew he was
a good man at whatever he did.
Nobody was pleased better than me
when I heard you had taken him on
as your -- whatever he was here.
STERNWOOD
As my friend, my son almost.
Many's the hour he would sit here
with me, sweating like a pig,
drinking the brandy I could no
longer drink, telling me stories
of the Irish revolution -- But
enough of this.
(he holds out
the envelope)
Here. And help yourself to the
brandy.
Marlowe takes the envelope, sits again, wipes his hands on
his wet handkerchief, removes from the envelope a card and
three clips of stiff paper.

STERNWOOD AND MARLOWE - (AS BEFORE)
Sternwood watching from wheelchair as Marlowe mixes himself
a drink at the wagon, then turns toward chair.
STERNWOOD
(watching Marlowe)
Well?
MARLOWE
(standing)
Who's Arthur Gwynne Geiger?
STERNWOOD
I haven't the faintest idea.
MARLOWE
Have you asked your daughter?

10.
STERNWOOD
I don't intend to. If I did she
would suck her thumb and look coy.
MARLOWE
Yeah. I met her in the hall. She
did that at me. Then she tried to
sit in my lap.
Sternwood stares at him. After a moment Marlowe raises the
glass, drinks, lowers it.
STERNWOOD
(harshly)
Well?
MARLOWE
(stares at him a moment)
Am I being polite, or can I say
what I want?
STERNWOOD
Say it.
MARLOWE
Do the two girls run around together?
STERNWOOD
I think not. They are alike only in
their one corrupt blood. Vivian is
spoiled, exacting, smart, ruthless.
Carmen is still the child who likes
to pull the wings off flies. I
assume they have always had all the
usual vices; whatever new ones of
their own invention -(again he makes
the repressed
convulsive
movement, glares
at Marlowe)
Well?
MARLOWE
Pay him.
STERNWOOD
Why?

11.
MARLOWE
It's cheaper. A little money
against a lot of annoyance. The
money you won't miss, and if your
heart hasn't broken long before this
time, whatever's behind these -(indicates the notes
on the chair)
-- can't do it now.
STERNWOOD
Not my heart. No Sternwood ever had
one. But there is my pride, which I
at least, and I believe my older
daughter still, both have.
MARLOWE
Sure. A man named A.G. Geiger's
just betting himself three thousand
bucks on that pride. Who was this
Joe Brody you paid the five thousand
to?
STERNWOOD
I don't recall. Norris would know.
My butler. I think he called himself
a gambler.
(hopefully)
This may be an authentic gambling
debt, after all.
Marlowe looks at Sternwood for a moment. Then he half
turns, sets the glass on the wagon and takes the napkin
from around the ice bucket and mops himself with it.
Sternwood watches him.
MARLOWE
Do you think it is?
STERNWOOD
(after a second)
No.
Marlowe mops himself again with the napkin, puts it back on
the wagon, takes up his glass, drinks.
MARLOWE
I guess you want me to take this
Geiger off your back: that right?
STERNWOOD
Yes.

12.
MARLOWE
Do you want to know anything, or do
you just want to be rid of him?
STERNWOOD
Didn't you just tell me I no longer
have any heart to be broken?
MARLOWE
It may cost you a little -- besides
my own twenty-five a day and expenses.
Sternwood says nothing, merely makes a faint, impatient
movement of his head or shoulders. Marlowe drains the
glass, sets it back on the wagon.
MARLOWE
When do I start?
STERNWOOD
At once. And now if you will excuse
me -- But another brandy before
you go?
MARLOWE
(takes up papers
from chair, then
his coat)
No thanks.
STERNWOOD
(presses bell plugged
into chair arm)
Then good morning. And good luck.
He lies back in the chair, closes his eyes. Marlowe
watches him a moment, then, his coat over his arm and still
mopping his neck, he turns and exits.
12.

EXT. GREENHOUSE - MARLOWE
emerges, still carrying his coat, dripping wet, mopping
with his sodden handkerchief, breathing the cool air,
starts away. Before he reaches the house, Norris meets
him, pauses two feet away, silver-haired, respectful,
grave.
NORRIS
Mrs. Rutledge, the older daughter
would like to see you before you
leave, sir. And about the money:
the General has instructed me to
give you a check for whatever you
require.

13.
MARLOWE
Instructed you how?
NORRIS
(blinks, stares,
then smiles)
Ah, I see, sir. I forgot you are a
detective. By the way he rang the
bell.
MARLOWE
You write his checks.
NORRIS
I have that privilege.
MARLOWE
(starts on)
That ought to save you from a pauper's
grave. I won't need any money now,
thanks -- How did Mrs. Rutledge know
I was here?
NORRIS
She saw you through the window. I
was obliged to tell her who you were.
MARLOWE
I don't like that.
NORRIS
Are you attempting to tell me my
duties, sir?
MARLOWE
No. Just having fun trying to guess
what they are.
NORRIS
This way, sir.
13.

INT. VIVIAN'S SITTING ROOM
The room is large, over-elaborate, feminine. VIVIAN
reclines on a chaise-lounge, showing her legs to good
advantage. She is beautiful, giving an impression of
strong will and strong emotions, the dangerous
unpredictable type.

14.
She sips a drink, insolently at ease, watching Marlowe as
he enters. Marlowe is still rumpled and sweating. He
adopts her be-damned-to-you attitude, looks her over, and
sits down unbidden, wiping his face and neck with his
handkerchief.
VIVIAN
So you're a private detective.
I didn't know they existed except
in books, or else they were little
greedy men snooping around hotels.
My, you're a mess, aren't you?
MARLOWE
Yeah -- I'm not the orchid-bearing
type.
VIVIAN
This business of Dad's -- think you
can handle it for him?
MARLOWE
(sardonically)
It doesn't look too tough.
VIVIAN
Really. I would have thought a
case like that took a little effort.
MARLOWE
Not too much.
Well!

VIVIAN
What will your first step be?

MARLOWE
The usual one.
VIVIAN
I didn't know there was a usual one.
MARLOWE
Oh, yes. It comes complete with
diagrams on Page forty-seven of "How
to be a Detective in Ten Easy Lessons",
correspondence school textbook.
VIVIAN
You must have read another one on
how to be a comedian. I'm quite
serious, Mr. Marlowe. My father
is not well, and I want this case
handled with the least possible
worry to him.

15.
MARLOWE
That's the way I'm going to handle
it.
I see.

VIVIAN
No professional secrets.

Marlowe doesn't answer. He's still admiring her legs.
Vivian sets her glass down, looking him over coolly, as
though he were something in a bottle.
VIVIAN
How do you like Dad?
MARLOWE
I liked him.
VIVIAN
He liked Shawn. I suppose you know
who Shawn is?
MARLOWE
Yeah, I know.
VIVIAN
You don't have to play poker with me.
Dad wants to find him, doesn't he?
MARLOWE
Do you?
VIVIAN
Of course I do! It wasn't right
for him to go off like that. Broke
Dad's heart, although he won't say
much about it. Or did he?
MARLOWE
He mentioned it.
VIVIAN
I don't see what there is to be cagey
about. And I don't like your manners.
MARLOWE
I'm not crazy about yours. I didn't
ask to see you. And I don't mind
your ritzing me, or drinking your
lunch out of a bottle. I don't mind
your showing me your legs. They're
very swell legs and it's a pleasure
to make their acquaintance. I don't
mind if you don't like my manners.
(MORE)

16.
MARLOWE (CONT'D)
They're pretty bad. I grieve over
them during the long winter evenings.
But don't waste your time trying to
cross-examine me.
Vivian is really angry now. She swings her legs to the
floor, and her anger is something sparkling and terrific.
VIVIAN
People don't talk like that to me.
Marlowe laughs at her softly. His eyes are warm and
mocking. Vivian relaxes slowly, looking at him, and
something besides fury comes into her own face.
VIVIAN
Do you always think you can handle
people like trained seals?
MARLOWE
Just what is it you're afraid of?
They watch each other, and Vivian's face closes against
him like a door.
VIVIAN
Dad didn't want to see you about
Shawn at all.
MARLOWE
Didn't he?
VIVIAN
Get out.
(as Marlowe rises
and turns from her)
Please... you could find Shawn if
Dad wanted you to.
MARLOWE
(still dead pan)
When did he go?
VIVIAN
A month back. He just drove away
one afternoon without saying a word.
They found his car in some private
garage.
MARLOWE
They?

17.
VIVIAN
(her manner suddenly
different, as though
she has won her bout
with him)
Dad didn't tell you then.
MARLOWE
He told me about Regan, yes. That's
not what he wanted to see me about.
Is that what you've been trying to
get me to say?
VIVIAN
I'm sure I don't care what you say.
MARLOWE
(giving her a look
she could chin
herself on)
You might change your mind about
that some day. So long, Mrs.
Rutledge.
Vivian watches him as he goes out, with smoldering,
puzzled eyes.

INT. MAIN BALL
Marlowe comes down the hall, heading for the door.
appears with Marlowe's hat and hands it to him.

Norris

MARLOWE
You made a mistake. Mrs. Rutledge
didn't want to see me.
NORRIS
I'm sorry, sir. I make many
mistakes.
He opens the door.
15.

Marlowe pauses to look at the view.

LONG SHOT - MARLOWE'S ANGLE
Beyond the lawns and hedges of the Sternwood estate the
ground falls away to barren fields with several old wooden
derricks, some of them still wearily pumping oil. The
derricks are at a considerable distance from the house, but
a man with binoculars could see any activity around them
clearly enough. The sky is clouded; THUNDER SOUNDS
distantly.

18.
16.

AT THE STERNWOOD DOOR
MARLOWE
How long those wells been pumping?
NORRIS
About thirty years. The General
likes to take his field glasses
sometimes and sit by the window
and watch the walking-beams. They're
like life, he says -- an endless
seesaw, forever up and down and
getting nowhere
MARLOWE
They get oil. Black stuff, with
a smell to it... worth dollars.
He goes out, gets into his car and drives away.

DISSOLVE TO:

18.

INT. LIBRARY
The typical reading room, with the usual characters hunched
over books at the tables. Marlowe stands by the
librarian's desk. A boy comes from the door to the stacks
and hands the librarian a book. She looks at it.
LIBRARIAN
Famous First Editions.
(looking at Marlowe
-- it is obvious
that she feels
he's not the
type to be
reading about
first editions)
This was the one you wanted?
MARLOWE
(blandly, as he
takes the book)
I collect blondes, too -- in bottles.
He walks over to a table and sits down, leaving the
woman staring after him.

19.
19.

EXT. GEIGER'S STORE - ESTABLISHING SHOT
Sign on window:

"RARE EDITIONS" etc.

Marlowe walks up and pauses to assure himself that it's
the right place. The store front is narrow. Discreet
gold lettering on the plate glass repeats the legend on
Geiger's card:
A.G. GEIGER
Rare Books and Deluxe Editions
The windows are blanked off with Chinese screens, fronted
by large Oriental urns. Marlowe puts on a pair of hornrimmed sun glasses, adjusts his hat to a less rakish
angle, and enters.
20.

INT. GEIGER'S STORE
The room is small, din, expensively underfurnished with
leather chairs, smoking stands, and a small psuedoOriental desk. A few sets of tooled leather binds on
narrow tables, others in glass cases.
AGNES, a hard-looking, expensive blonde in a tight black
dress, rises from behind the desk as Marlowe approaches
and moves to greet him. Her manner is professionally
distant, her accent betrays her phony veneer.
AGNES
Can I be of any assistance?
MARLOWE
Would you happen to have a Ben
Hur 1860?
AGNES
(hanging on hard
to her composure,
seeing that she's
going to have
trouble with Marlowe)
A first edition?
MARLOWE
No. Third -- the one with the
erratum on page one-sixteen.
AGNES
I'm afraid not -- at the moment.

20.
MARLOWE
How about a Chevalier Audubon -the full set of course?
AGNES
(with a frozen smile)
Uh -- not at the moment.
MARLOWE
(politely)
You do sell books?
AGNES
(dropping the act,
pointing to the
display books)
What do those look like -grapefruit?
MARLOWE
They look like books from here,
anyway. Maybe I'd better talk
to Mr. Geiger.
AGNES
He's not in at the moment.
Marlowe glances up as a man enters the store; a middleaged, important-looking person who has an incongruously
furtive and nervous manner. He looks quickly at Marlowe,
then at Agnes, who gives him an almost imperceptible
warning nod. Marlowe remains blandly unaware of the
byplay, all his attention apparently on the cigarette he's
lighting.
The man walks quickly to the rear of the store. Agnes
pushes a button on the desk. A door in the back wall opens
on a buzzer lock. The man darts through it like a rabbit.
AGNES
(to Marlowe)
I said Mr. Geiger is not in.
MARLOWE
I'll wait for him.

I heard you.

AGNES
He won't be back until very late.
At this point the furtive man comes out of the rear part of
the store and leaves hurriedly, looking at neither Agnes
nor Marlowe. His face is lined and haggard. Marlowe is
interested.

21.
MARLOWE
(watching the man out)
He must have got hold of the wrong
title.
(to Agnes)
Well, guess I'd better blow. I'm
already late now for my lecture on
Argentine cera-micks.
(mispronouncing the word)
AGNES
(icily, correcting him)
The word is cerAMics. And they ain't
Argentine: they're Egyptian.
MARLOWE
You did sell a book once, didn't
you? Well, even the Argentine's
a little too far for me today.
Guess I'll just stick to the public
library -- or I might try that
book store across the street.
AGNES
(freezing)
Do so.
Agnes stares viciously at his back until he is out. Then
she goes to the door at the rear, knocks and goes through.
21.

MOVING SHOT - MARLOWE
He walks across the boulevard, turns into a small
bookstore, the second-hand variety, cluttered and dingy.
Several nondescript people browse among the tables. At the
rear a small, dark, shrewd-faced woman sits reading at a
desk -- apparently she is the proprietor. Marlowe
approaches her, and she looks up blank-faced from her book.
MARLOWE
Would you do me a very small favor?
PROPRIETRESS
I don't know. What is it?
MARLOWE
You know Geiger's store across the
street?
PROPRIETRESS
I think I may have passed it.
MARLOWE
You know Geiger by sight?

22.
PROPRIETRESS
I should think it would be easy
enough to go to his store and ask
to see him.
MARLOWE
I don't want to see him that close,
just yet.
(as he gets no response)
Know anything about rare books?
PROPRIETRESS
You could try me.
MARLOWE
Would you have a Ben Hur, 1860,
Third Edition, with the duplicated
line on page one-sixteen?
The woman pulls a fat volume in front of her, starts to
open it.
MARLOWE
...or a Chevalier Audubon 1840...?
The woman stops, closes the book.
PROPRIETRESS
Nobody would. There isn't one.
MARLOWE
Right.
(as the woman gives
him a puzzled stare)
The girl in Geiger's store didn't
know that.
PROPRIETRESS
I see. You begin to interest me -vaguely.
MARLOWE
I'm a private dick on a case. Perhaps
I ask too much.
(leaning forward to
hold a match for
her cigarette)
It didn't seem much to me somehow.

23.
PROPRIETRESS
(after a pause)
In his early forties, medium height,
fattish, soft all over, a Charlie
Chan moustache. Well dressed, goes
without a hat, affects a knowledge
of antiques and hasn't any. Oh yes,
his left eye is glass.
MARLOWE
You'd make a good cop.
PROPRIETRESS
(returning to
her reading)
Only if he wore smoked glasses.
MARLOWE
(laughing softly -pulling a flat
pint from his
hip pocket)
I shouldn't think you'd have to work
too hard to start anything smoking.
He shakes the bottle up and down, invitingly.
at him, searchingly, then smiles slowly.

She looks up

PROPRIETRESS
It's going to rain, soon.
MARLOWE
I'd rather get wet in here.
She pulls open a drawer and stands two small glasses on

It is raining hard outside. The proprietress is a little
tight, quite relaxed, and slightly philosophical, leaning
against Marlowe, who sits on a stack of Britannicas beside
her, watching the window. The proprietress picks up the
bottle, which is now empty, shakes it forlornly, and sets
it down again.
PROPRIETRESS
A couple of hours, an empty bottle,

LONG SHOT - NIGHT (RAIN) ESTABLISHING A SECTION OF LAVERNE
TERRACE
A narrow street with a high bank on one side and a
scattering of cabinlike houses built down the slope on the
other side, so that their roofs are not much above street
level. They are masked by hedges and shrubs. Sodden trees
line the dark road.

25.
The headlights of a car appear. Geiger's coupe drives up
and stops in front of the garage of a small house almost
completely hidden by a square box hedge. Geiger gets out,
opens an umbrella, and vanishes behind the hedge. Almost
immediately Marlowe's car appears, continuing slowly past
Geiger's house. It turns, stops under a tree. The lights
go out.

behind the hedge. The DOORBELL RINGS faintly, the door

INT. MARLOWE'S CAR - NIGHT (RAIN)
SHOOTING obliquely across Marlowe's shoulder, showing the
street and particularly Geiger's house through the rainstreaked windscreen. Suddenly a hard white flash of light
shoots out of Geiger's house like s flash of lightning.
Close on its heels comes a woman's thin half-pleasurable
scream. Marlowe is out of the car and on his way.

30.

EXT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)
Marlowe rounds the hedge on the run. There is a wooden
footbridge bridging the gap between the bank and the front
door. He covers this in two jumps and stops at the front
door. The knocker is in the shape of a lion's head, and
ring in its mouth. Marlowe puts his hand on it, and as he
does, three SHOTS SOUND from inside.
Marlowe freezes. From inside we HEAR a sighing groan and
the thud of a falling body, then footsteps going away.
Marlowe looks over the railing of the bridge, but there's
no way around to the back. He stands still, listening.
Light shows from the house, behind draperies. From
offscene at some distance, we HEAR someone running down
steps.

As a car starts and roars away with clashing gears. Almost
before it is out of sight a second car pulls out from under
shrouding trees and follows it.

33.

EXT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - AT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT (RAIN)
The SOUND of the two cars is still audible, fading into
distance. Marlowe listens to it. When everything is quiet
again he tries the front door, finds it locked. French
windows flank the door just out of reach beyond the railing
of the bridge. Marlowe swings out over the railing, kicks
in the right-hand window, and pulls himself over the sill.

34.

INT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
As Marlowe comes in through the window. The room is wide,
low-beamed ceiling, brown plaster walls with strips of
Chinese embroidery and Oriental prints on them. Low
bookshelves, a desk, thick rug floor cushions, low divans
-- an exotic messy atmosphere.

27.
On a low dais at one end of the room is a carved teakwood
chair, a massive thing in which Carmen Sternwood sits,
rigidly erect, in the pose of an Egyptian goddess.
She wears a man's large silk dressing gown -- it doesn't
pretend to fit her and gives the impression of having been
thrown hurriedly around her by someone other than herself.
Carmen's eyes have a queer fixed stare. She pays no
attention to Marlowe. She looks as if, in her mind, she is
doing something very important and doing it well. She
seems pleased about it, her lips curved to a smile. She
laughs from time to time -- softly, secretly.
Opposite her, Geiger lies on the floor in front of a thing
like a totem pole. The eye of the totem is a camera lens;
it focuses on the chair where Carmen sits. A blackened
flash bulb is clipped to the totem beside it. Geiger is
dressed in semi-oriental fashion. His embroidered coat is
soaked with blood. He is obviously dead.
Marlowe takes all this in, sniffs the air. It is heavy
with something unpleasant. He crosses to a small lacquer
table bearing a flagon of dark liquid and two glasses.
Marlowe sniffs the flagon, makes a grimace of disgust.
Carmen's clothes are wadded up on the divan. Marlowe picks
up her coat and shoes and goes to her.
Hello.

MARLOWE
Remember me.

She doesn't seem to see him. The soft, secret laughter is
his only answer. He goes closer, and deliberately slaps
her face. This gets a reaction -- he slaps her again,
without emotion, but hard. Carmen comes to, slightly,
giving him a sly, mad smile.
MARLOWE
You're higher than a kite. Come on,
let's be nice. Let's get dressed,
Carmen.
He puts her shoes on.
CARMEN
(giggling)
You tickle.
MARLOWE
Yeah, you tickle me, too.
Marlowe pulls her to her feet and puts her coat on, trying
not to dislodge the dressing gown. She falls against him,
very happy about it all, apparently about to pass out.
Marlowe is not happy.

28.
MARLOWE
Let's take a walk.
CARMEN

You're cute.
MARLOWE
Sure, sure. So's your boyfriend.

MARLOWE
Let's walk.

Yeah.

He walks her back and forth across the room a couple of
times -- LOW CAMERA FEATURING the dead man as their legs
pass in front of him. Then she passes out in his arms,
still convinced that everything is cute. He spreads her
out on the divan, unconsciously wiping his hands on his
coat as though he has touched something dirty.
Then he returns to the totem and Geiger's body. He
examines the concealed camera. The plateholder is gone.
He rolls Geiger's body over enough to see under it. No
plateholder. He frowns thoughtfully at the girl... then
goes into the rear of the house.

INT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - REAR ROOMS - NIGHT
Marlowe passes quickly through the bath and kitchen,
pausing to try the locked kitchen door and to examine a
window which had been jimmied open. The scars show plainly
on the wood, the rain blowing in unheeded. Marlowe then
goes to the bedroom, which is in keeping with the living
room. He glances briefly through the closet, with a man's
clothes in it, then picks up a keyholder from the dressing
table, where it has been placed along with other contents
of Geiger's pockets -- money, handkerchief, etc.

36.

INT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Marlowe returns and unlocks the desk. In one drawer he
finds a locked steel box, which he opens with Geiger's

cards General Sternwood gave him.

Marlowe places the book in his pocket, wipes his
fingerprints carefully from the box, replaces it end locks
the desk. He pockets the keys, turns off the lamps and the
gas logs in the fireplace, makes a wadded bundle of
Carmen's clothes, jams her hat on her head and picks her
up, holding her clothes awkwardly in one hand. On the way
out he pushes down the light switch by the door, and kicks
the door shut behind him.

Marlowe again -- the same quiet, grave face with its
expression of grief and sadness which the sight of the car
brought into it. His voice though is quiet and calm.

grief a little sharper behind it.

Marlowe, a shadowy figure, enters, closes door behind him,
crosses the room to a lamp, turns the switch. Marlowe is
quite wet, indicating that he has walked back from
Sternwood's.

31.
He stands with his hand still on the light switch, looks
about the room, crosses to another tamp, puts it on, is
about to turn away when he stops dead, reacts as he looks
at the totem pole and at the floor beneath it where
Geiger's body had lain.
The body is gone. Marlowe crosses the room, wasting no
time, determined. He passes through door to bedroom, snaps
light on beyond it, after a moment the light beyond the
door snaps off and Marlowe re-enters living room. He has
not found the body. He stands for a moment, thinking, then
he goes and kneels so that he can squint along the surface
of the thick rug. He sees in the nap the marks where
Geiger's heels were dragged along it, across the room
toward the front door. He rises at last, thoughtful,
slowly takes out a cigarette and lights it, drops match
into ashtray, stops, takes up the dead match and puts it
into his pocket.
Then he takes out his handkerchief, goes and wipes off the
bedroom doorknob, goes to the first lamp, turns it out and
wipes it off, leaving room in darkness and himself a shadow
which can be barely seen in the act of wiping off that
button. Then he crosses the room.

in the course of his duty, has killed several lawbreakers,
at times when he was outnumbered and they thought he was
covered and helpless until too late. He is pleasant and
affable to all, respects courage, loves no man.

Marlowe, a uniformed deputy, two plainclothesmen and the
Medical Examiner who has just finished repacking his small
black bag.
OHLS

What's the story?
DEPUTY
You can see most of it from here.
Went through the rail yonder. Must

handsome boy in the leather jacket, opens the door in the
rear wall. Behind him, through the open door, we see the
back room, littered with the papers and boxes of hurried
packing, and a gaunt, hard-looking man with a certain
animal attractiveness in the midst of it, cramming folios

unintelligible, answered by a heavier, man's voice -- no
words come through, but the implication is clearly that
Carol shall shut up and get out. A door slams violently,
then there is silence. Marlowe, ignoring this byplay, and
the stricken look on Agnes' face, puts on his glasses and
touches his hat.

You can insult me just as well face
to face. I don't bite -- much.
VIVIAN
(apologetically)
I was rather rude.
MARLOWE
(smiling)
An apology from a Sternwood?

connecting door,
holding it for her)
Come into my boudoir.

usual desk, chairs, and filing cabinets.
VIVIAN
(sitting)
You don't put on much of a front.
MARLOWE
You can't make much money at this
trade, if you're honest. If you
have a front, you're making money
or expect to.
VIVIAN
Oh -- are you honest?
MARLOWE
Painfully.
VIVIAN
(taking out a cigarette)
How did you get into this slimy
business, then?

The

MARLOWE
(giving her a look
as he lights it
for her)
Because people like you pay good
money to have the slime cleaned up.
She looks away from him, angry hut not able to say
anything. Marlowe sits down behind the desk.
MARLOWE
What did you want to see me about?
Taylor?
VIVIAN
(softly)
Poor Owen. So you know about that.
MARLOWE
A D.A.'s man took me down to Lido.
Turned out he knew more about it
than I did. He knew Owen Taylor
wanted to marry your sister -- once.
VIVIAN
(quietly)
Perhaps it wouldn't have been a bad
idea. He was in love with her. We
don't find much of that in our
circle...
(changing her tone)
But I didn't come to see you about
Owen. Do you feel yet that you can
tell me what my father wants you to
do?
MARLOWE
Not without his permission.
VIVIAN
Was it about Carmen?
MARLOWE
I can't even say that.
Vivian watches him for a moment, then gives in. She takes
a thick white envelope from her bag and tosses it on the
desk.
VIVIAN
You'd better look at this anyway.
Marlowe examines the envelope.

45.
VIVIAN
A messenger brought it this morning.
MARLOWE
Eight-thirty-five it says -- for
you or your father.
He opens the envelope, takes out a medium-sized photograph.
We do not see the subject of the picture, but Marlowe's
reaction is significant. He whistles softly.
MARLOWE
So that's what Carmen looks like!
(to Vivian)
How much do they want for this?
VIVIAN
Five thousand -- for the negative and
the rest of the prints. The deal has
to be closed tonight, or they give
the picture to some scandal sheet.
MARLOWE
The demand came how?
VIVIAN
A woman telephoned me, shortly after
this thing was delivered.
MARLOWE
There's nothing in the scandal sheet
angle. Juries convict on that racket
without leaving the box. What else
is there?
VIVIAN
Does there have to be something else?
Marlowe nods -- his face is uncompromising.
VIVIAN
(giving in again)
The woman said there was a police
jam connected with it, and I'd
better lay it on the line fast or
I'd be talking to my little sister
through a wire screen.
MARLOWE
(deadpan, nodding)
What kind of a jam?
VIVIAN
I don't know.

46.
MARLOWE
Where's Carmen now?
VIVIAN
She's at home -- still in bed, I
think. She was sick last night.
MARLOWE
She go out at all?
VIVIAN
The servants say she didn't. I
was up at Las Olindas across the
State line playing roulette at
Eddie Mars' Cypress Club. I lost
my shirt.
(taking another
cigarette -laughing wryly)
MARLOWE
(getting up to
hold the match
for her)
So you like roulette.

You would.

VIVIAN
Yes, the Sternwoods all like losing
games. The Sternwoods can afford
to. The Sternwoods have money.
(bitterly)
All it's bought them is a raincheck.
MARLOWE
What was Owen doing with your car
last night?
VIVIAN
Nobody knows. He took it without
permission. Do you think...?
MARLOWE
He knew about this photo?
(shrugging)
I don't rule him out... Can you get
five thousand in cash right away?
VIVIAN
I can borrow it -- probably from
Eddie Mars.
(sardonically)
There's a bond between us, you
see. Shawn Regan ran away with
Eddie's blonde wife.

47.
MARLOWE
(turning away -leaving a pause)
You may need the money in a
hurry.
VIVIAN
How about telling the police?
MARLOWE
You know better than that. The
police might turn up something
they couldn't sit on -- and then
where would the Sternwoods be?
(after a pause)
How was it left?
VIVIAN
The woman said she'd call me back
with instructions at five.
MARLOWE
Okay -- call me here as soon as
you've heard from her.
VIVIAN
Can you do anything?
MARLOWE
I think so. But I can't tell you
how -- or why.
I like you.

VIVIAN
You believe in miracles.

MARLOWE
(laughing)
I believe in people believing they're
smarter than they are -- if that's
a miracle. Have a drink?
He reaches down into the desk drawer.
VIVIAN
I'll have two drinks.
Marlowe grins at her. He comes up with a bottle and two
glasses, fills them, and takes one to her. They salute,
start to drink and find that their eyes have met over the
glass rims and refuse to come apart. Vivian breaks it, not
because she is shy or coy, but because suddenly there is a
sadness in her face. Her gaze drops briefly, then returns
to Marlowe, clear, steady, and sad.

48.
VIVIAN
You're a lot like Shawn Regan.
Marlowe looks at her, almost with tenderness and
understanding.
MARLOWE
You want to tell me now or later?
VIVIAN
What?
MARLOWE
What you're so anxious to find out.
VIVIAN
It couldn't be -- you.
MARLOWE
Let's do one thing at a time.
VIVIAN
(rising)
I think we've done enough for one
day...
MARLOWE
(gently)
Want that other drink?
VIVIAN
(going toward door)
No...
Marlowe sets his glass down on the desk and picks up the
envelope.
MARLOWE
You forgot this.
She turns by the door as he approaches, holding out her
hand for the envelope. Marlowe gives it to her, but
doesn't let go of it.
They are not thinking about the envelope. Slowly he bends
to her -- she leans back against the wall, her lips parted,
her eyes soft, misted with tears. Marlowe's mouth covers
hers. Presently they break -- Vivian puts her hand on
Marlowe's cheek.

49.
VIVIAN
(softly)
Your face is like Shawn's too -clean and thin, with hard bones
under it...
She turns, neither slowly nor fast, away from him, opens
the door, and goes out.

EXT. LAVERNE TERRACE - AT MARLOWE'S CAR - DAY
Parked unobtrusively under some trees a reasonable distance
from Geiger's house. Marlowe sits patiently, waiting, his
hat pushed to the back of his head, his collar loosened,
smoking quietly. Presently, in b.g. in front of Geiger's
house, Carmen Sternwood appears furtively around the far
end of the hedge, and goes quickly in through the gap
leading to the front door. Marlowe reacts, then gets out,
to follow her.

69.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CARMEN
standing in an attitude of terror, her back pressed against
the wall beside the front door to Geiger's house, staring
at Marlowe as he enters. She raises one hand and clenches
her teeth on her thumb, staring at him. The terror fades a
little as she recognizes him. She wears coat, hat, veil,
etc.
MARLOWE
Remember me now, don't you? Doghouse
Reilly, the man that didn't grow
very tall. Remember?
CARMEN
(making an effort
to seem natural)
Is this your doghouse?
Sure.

MARLOWE
Let's go inside, huh?

CARMEN
(shrinking, cringing)
Inside?
MARLOWE
You wanted to get in, didn't you?
He pushes her away, unlocks the door, pushes it inward.

50.
MARLOWE
In with you.
He shoves Carmen in ahead of him, follows.

INT. GEIGER'S LIVING ROOM - CARMEN AND MARLOWE
Carmen standing, looking about the room, as Marlowe shuts
the door and stands looking at Carmen. She feels him
watching her, smiles at him. He doesn't answer it. The
smile fades. Marlowe takes out pack of cigarettes, offers
it. She shakes her head dumbly, staring at him. He lights
a cigarette.
MARLOWE
How much do you remember about
last night?
CARMEN
Remember what? I was sick last
night. I was home.
MARLOWE
Sure you were. I mean, before you
went hone. In that chair yonder -on that orange shawl while they were
taking pictures. Quit stalling.
(staring at him, she
starts to put her
thumb in her mouth
again)
And stop biting your thumb too.
CARMEN
You -- were the one?
Me.

MARLOWE
How much do you remember?

CARMEN
Are you the police?
MARLOWE
I'm a friend of your father's.
(a moment)
Who killed him?
No.

CARMEN
(faintly)
Who else... knows?

51.
MARLOWE
About Geiger? Not the police, or
they'd be camping here.
(a moment)
Maybe Joe Brody.
Joe Brody?

CARMEN
Who's he?

MARLOWE
Sure. Not Steve Brody: Joe
Brody. Did Joe kill him?
CARMEN
Kill who?
MARLOWE
Look sister. I don't know how much
trouble you are accustomed to, but
I hope you've had plenty of practice
dodging it.
CARMEN
(nods her head)
Yes. Joe did it.
MARLOWE
Why?
(she watches him
out of the corners
of her eyes, biting
her thumb; he draws
on cigarette, expels)
Seen much of him lately?
No!

CARMEN
I hate him!

MARLOWE
So you're all ready to tell the
cops he did it, huh?
(quickly, as she
stares at him)
That is, if we can just get rid
of that photograph Geiger made
last night.
Photograph?

CARMEN
What photograph?

52.
MARLOWE
(drags at cigarette,
expels smoke)
Just like last night. What a scream
we are. Sternwood and Reilly, two
stooges in search of a comedian.
CARMEN
Your name isn't Reilly.
Vivian told me.

It's Marlowe.

MARLOWE
So you are beginning to remember.
And you came back to look for the
photograph, but you couldn't get
into the house.
(she stares at him)
The photo's gone. I looked for it
last night. Brody took it with him.
CARMEN
I've got to go home now.
MARLOWE
Sure. But I wouldn't tell the
police about Brody yet. Don't even
tell a soul you were ever here -either last night, or today. Net
even Vivian. Leave it to Doghouse
Reilly. Where's your car?
CARMEN
On the back street, where nobody
would see it.
She turns to go out as he turns to follow.
MARLOWE
You're not going to tell anybody
we were here, are you?
CARMEN
(gives him a swooning look)
It depends. I never tell on people
who are nice to me.
She gives him a languishing, swooning, inviting look, so
that her attitude is a caricature of what her more
brilliant and vivid sister's might be. Marlowe grasps her
arm almost savagely, turns her toward the door.
Come on.

MARLOWE
Get out of here --

53.
He stops; they both react as FEET SOUND beyond the doer,
approaching, they pause dead as the BELL RINGS. While they
stand staring at each other, Carmen drooling almost with
terror, the BELL RINGS AGAIN, ceases, then SOUND of KEY at
the lock and a moment later the door opens and EDDIE MARS
enters quickly and then stops dead, staring at them. He is
a handsome, hard, horsy-looking man in beautiful,
restrained, expensive clothes, who stands staring at them
with complete composure for a moment. Then he looks at
Carmen, shuts the door, takes his hat off.
MARS
Excuse the casual entrance. The bell
didn't answer. Is Mr. Geiger around?
MARLOWE
No. We don't knew just where he is.
We found the doer open and stepped in.
I see.

MARS
Friends of his?

MARLOWE
Just business. We dropped in for
a book.
Mars stares hard at Marlowe, who stares just as hard
back.
MARLOWE
But we missed him.
(takes Carmen's arm,
pushes her toward
door to pass Mars)
So we'll trot along.
As Marlowe is about to shoulder Mars aside to pass, Mars
himself steps aside until Carmen has passed him, then he
moves in between Marlowe and the door.
MARS
The girl can go. But I'd like
to talk to you a little.
Marlowe stares at him, then makes a slight motion toward
the gun inside his coat.
MARS
Don't try it. I've got two boys
outside in the car.
He turns, opens the door, Carmen scuttles through it.
shuts the door behind her, looks about the room.

Mars

54.
MARS
(puts hat back on)
There's something wrong around here.
I intend to find out what it is. If
you want to pick lead out of yourself,
go ahead.
MARLOWE
A tough guy.
Mars makes no answer. He walks on into the room, looking
around. Marlowe watches him.
MARLOWE
I suppose it's all right if I
smoke.
Mars does not answer. He looks about, sees the totem pole,
is astonished, approaches it, stops suddenly as he moves
the small rug over the bloodstain with his foot, then
kneels swiftly out of sight for an instant beyond the desk.
When he rises, he is facing Marlowe and his hand is just
emerging from inside his coat, holding a Luger pistol.
MARS
Blood. On the floor there, under
the rug. Quite a lot of blood.
MARLOWE
(in interested tone)
Is that so?
Mars slides into the chair behind the desk, still watching
Marlowe, hooks the telephone toward him with the pistolbarrel, then shifts the pistol to his left hand and puts
his right hand on the phone but without raising it.
MARS
I think we'll have some law.
Marlowe approaches while Mars watches him, and looks down
at the stain, pretends to have seen it for the first time.
MARLOWE
That's old blood. Dried.
MARS
Just the same, we'll have some law.
MARLOWE
Why not?
MARS
Just who are you anyway?

55.
MARLOWE
Marlowe's the name.

I'm a private

MARS
Who's the girl?
MARLOWE
A client. Geiger was trying to
throw a loop on her. We came to
talk it over. He wasn't here.
MARS
Convenient -- the door being
open, when you didn't have a key.
MARLOWE
Wasn't it? By the way, how'd you
happen to have one?
MARS
Is that any of your business?
MARLOWE
I could make it my business.
MARS
(smiles tightly)
And I could make your business mine.
MARLOWE
You wouldn't like it.

The pay's

MARS
I own this house. Geiger is my
tenant. Now what do you think
of it?
MARLOWE
You know some nice people.
MARS
I take them as they come.
(he glances down
at the pistol,
shrugs, puts
it back inside
coat)
Got any ideas, detective?

56.
MARLOWE
One or two. Somebody gunned Geiger.
Somebody got gunned by Geiger, who
ran away. Or Geiger was running a
cult and made blood sacrifices in
front of that barber pole there. Or
he had meat for dinner and does his
butchering in the front parlor.
(Mars scowls at him)
All right. I'll give up, then. Call
your friends downtown.
MARS
I don't get it. I still don't
get your game here.
MARLOWE
Don't you, Mr. Mars?
Mars stares et Marlowe, who meets his stare steadily.
Mars' face is now hard.
MARS
You seem to be telling me Geiger
was in a racket of some sort.
What racket?
MARLOWE
I don't know. I'm not his landlord.
And I'll tell you something else you
missed. Somebody cleaned out
whatever was in that back room in
his bookshop today.
Mars stares at Marlowe a long moment. Marlowe takes out
a cigarette deliberately, is starting to light it.
MARS
You talk too much.
While Marlowe stands, the cigarette in his mouth, the
matchbox resting in his hands, Mars suddenly whips out the
pistol again, holds it on Marlowe, and whistles shrilly.
SOUND of car door SLAMMING OFF, then RUNNING FEET.
MARS
Open the door.
MARLOWE
Open it yourself. I've already got
a client.

57.
Mars rises, still holding the pistol on Marlowe, crosses
toward the door as the SOUND OF FEET reaches the door and
the knob is rattled from outside. Mars reaches the door,
opens it. Two men plunge into the room, already reaching
inside their coats. One is a young hoodlum, good-looking,
pale-faced boy, the other is older, slim, deadpan.
MARS
(jerks his head
at Marlowe)
Look him over...
The slim man flicks out a short pistol, covers Marlowe.
The boy approaches, searches Marlowe, who turns, helping
the boy search him with the burlesqued air of a bored
beauty modeling a gown in a shop.
Okay.

BOY
No iron.

MARS
Find who he is.
The boy draws Marlowe's wallet from his breast pocket,
flips it open, studies the contents.
BOY
A shamus.
He strikes. Marlowe, moving faster, catches his wrist,
wrenches it suddenly and sharply, so that in the next
instant the wallet is in Marlowe's hand. The boy reacts
angrily, but Mars stops it.
MARS
(sharply)
That'll do. Beat it.
The boy stops sullenly, glaring at Marlowe.
MARS
(coldly vicious)
I said, outside.
The two guards withdraw, exit.
All right.

MARS
Talk.

Marlowe deliberately finishes lighting the cigarette,
inhales.

58.
MARLOWE
Not to you. I told you I've already
got a client.
MARS
Who was it cleaned out the back of
Geiger's store?
MARLOWE
Quite a shower yesterday. Did it
rain up there at Las Olindas?
MARS
(slaps the pistol
angrily down on
the desk)
I might even make it worth your
while to talk to me.
MARLOWE
That's the spirit. Leave the gun
out of it. I can always hear money.
How much of it are you clinking at
me?
MARS
(slams the desk
again with the
flat pistol)
I ask you a question, and you ask
me another. My guess is, you need
some help yourself. So cough up.
MARLOWE
Not me. It's Geiger's kinfolk that
need help -- provided a man like
Geiger had anybody who loved him and
will care who bumped him off. So
I'd better give what I know to the
Law. Which puts it in the public
domain and don't leave me anything
to sell. So I guess I'll drift.
Marlowe makes a move to lift the gun, but does not.
MARLOWE
(easily)
By the way, how's Mrs. Mars these
days?
Mars' hand jerks at the gun, almost lifts it, pauses.

Marlowe moves easily and unhurriedly toward the door.

EXT. STREET - BEFORE GEIGER'S HOUSE
as Marlowe gets into his car. A short distance behind it
Mars' car is parked, the two guards in it. Marlowe drives
away. He expects a shot perhaps. As he drives away he
burlesques it: holds his hand out the window as if he were
testing the air for rain. He drives on.

INT. MARLOWE'S OFFICE - EVENING - MARLOWE
sitting at his desk, the phone pulled up in front of him.
He smokes nervously -- he seems to have been waiting some
time -- and glances at his wristwatch. The PHONE RINGS.
He grabs it.
MARLOWE
Yeah... What's the news?... Nothing
-- you mean they haven't called you?
(smiling sardonically)
Mrs. Rutledge... You are not a very
good liar. I thought you were going
to trust me...
(jerking the phone
away from his ear
with exaggerated
haste)
Why, Mrs. Rutledge!
The PHONE CLICKS LOUDLY as the other end is slammed down on
the hook. Marlowe replaces his instrument slowly. He is
not clowning now. He speaks softly to the telephone as
though to Vivian herself, half in admiration, half in
anger.
MARLOWE
You crazy darn fool...
He picks up his hat and goes out.

to 405 and presses the bell. In one of the other
apartments a radio plays softly. Presently the door of 405
opens noiselessly, just wide enough to show the man who
stands behind it -- JOE BRODY, whom we have seen before, in
the back room of Geiger's store and later driving the panel
truck. He looks steadily at Marlowe and does not speak.
His right hand holds the door. A cigarette smolders in the
corner of his mouth.

You're Joe Brody?
BRODY
So what?
MARLOWE
So you're Joe Brody -- and you don't
know anybody named Geiger. That's
very funny.

61.
BRODY
Yeah? You got a funny sense of
humor, maybe. Take it away and play
it somewhere else.
Marlowe leans against the door and gives him a dreamy
smile.
MARLOWE
You got Geiger's stuff, Joe. I
got his sucker list. We ought to
talk things over.
BRODY
(glancing sideways
into the room, then
back to Marlowe)
There's plenty of time to talk.
Make it tomorrow, bud.
He starts to close the door. Marlowe bares his teeth and
shoves the door in against Brody, viciously.
MARLOWE
(pleasantly)
We'll make it now.

INT. BRODY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A pleasant room, nicely furnished. French windows open
onto a balcony; near the windows a closed door, and near
the entrance another door with a heavy curtain drawn across
it. Marlowe closes the entrance door behind him, not
taking his eyes from Brody. Brody stands still, his hand
frozen underneath his coat, his eyes wolfish. Presently he
breaks, letting his hand drop.
BRODY

Why not, if you think you got
something.
Marlowe smiles, glancing at the curtained doorway.
woman's shoes show below the edge.

A

MARLOWE
You alone, Joe?
BRODY
(meaningfully)
Yeah.
Marlowe lifts the curtain, high enough to show a very
spiffy leg -- Vivian's, in fact. He admires it.

62.
MARLOWE
I could be alone with that almost
any time.
He drops the curtain again, goes to the davenport, and sits
down, tossing his hat beside him. Brody picks up a box of
cigars from a nearby table, walks to an easy chair opposite
Marlowe, and sits.
BRODY
Well, I'm listening.
He drops his cigarette stub into a tray and puts a cigar
between his lips.
BRODY
Cigar?
He tosses one to Marlowe through the air. As Marlowe
reaches out to catch it Brody takes a Police Special out of
the cigar box and covers Marlowe, who relaxes slowly, like
a steel spring.
BRODY
Okay, stand up. Slow.
MARLOWE
(not moving, smiling
sardonically)
My, my -- such a lot of guns around
town, and so few brains. You're the
second guy I've met today who seems
to think a gat in the hand means the
world by the tail.
(derisively)
Put it down, Joe.
(as Joe doesn't move,
only looks nastier)
The other guy's name is Eddie Mars.
Ever hear of him?
BRODY
No.
MARLOWE
If he ever gets wise to where you
were last night in the rain -- you'll
hear of him.
BRODY
(deadpan, but
lowering the gun)
What would I be to Eddie Mars?

63.
MARLOWE
Not even a memory.
BRODY
Don't get me wrong. I'm not a tough
guy -- just careful.
MARLOWE
You're not careful enough. That play
with Geiger's stuff was terrible. I
saw it, you know. I don't think
Geiger's boy friend liked it.
BRODY
Carol Lundgren? That punk.
MARLOWE
Punk burns, sometimes.
(raises his voice
to the curtain door)
You might as well come out, Vivian.
Brody decided not to shoot me just yet.
(as the curtain parts
slightly to show
Vivian, undecided)
Oh, yeah, and bring the blonde with
you.
Yeah.

Vivian comes out, followed by Agnes. Vivian looks
strained, angry, indomitable. Agnes looks merely vicious.
MARLOWE
(to Agnes)
Hello, sugar.
AGNES
(sourly)
Hello -- trouble!
Agnes flounces down on the arm of an overstuffed chair.
Brody watches, his eyes hard and narrow, expressionless.
Vivian stands looking down at Marlowe. She is definitely
not glad to see him.
MARLOWE
So you don't really believe in
miracles -- or me.
VIVIAN
I've learned not to believe in
anything. I don't need you,
Marlowe. I don't know how you
got here, but I don't want you.
Will you get out?

64.
MARLOWE
But darling, the man with the gun
won't let me. Look -- he's all
bothered and curious, wondering
about stuff.
BRODY
(menacingly)
Yeah -- you bet I'm wondering.
(looking sharply
from Vivian to
Marlowe, then
to Agnes)
Agnes -- put some more light on so
I can see to shoot if I have to.
(to Vivian, as
Agnes switches
on a floor lamp)
You -- sit down, and keep quiet.
VIVIAN
Joe, I swear I didn't have anything
to do...
MARLOWE
(attempting to draw
her down beside him)
Don't argue with the man. Here...
(taking Vivian's handbag,
hefting it to assure
himself the wad of
bills is still inside,
and grinning with
satisfaction, placing
bag on couch)
Sit on this, baby... Go ahead. You
won't need it.
VIVIAN
Marlowe, you're ruining everything.
MARLOWE
(finally losing
patience, yanking
her down bodily)
Sit down!
Vivian struggles with him angrily. Marlowe puts his arm
around her and smiles mockingly at Brody, who raises his
gun slightly, with unpleasant significance.
BRODY
Give out.

Okay, fella.

65.
MARLOWE
(shaking his head)
Uh-uh, Joe -- you're doing the
giving.
BRODY
(leaning forward, menacingly)
Listen...
MARLOWE
Sure, sure -- You're the hard boy
with the gun. Okay -- go ahead,
blow holes in me. That won't take
the cops off your neck.
BRODY
What cops?
MARLOWE
The cops that are going to find out
where all that lead in Geiger came
from.
He rises, pacing with nervous catlike energy as he talks,
his sheer ease and conviction holding Brody motionless.
MARLOWE
You shot Geiger, last night in the
rain. The trouble is he wasn't
alone when you whiffed him. Either
you didn't notice that -- and I
think you did -- or you got scared
and ran. But you had nerve enough
to take the plate out of his camera,
and you had nerve enough to come
back later and hide his corpse, so
you could clean out his store before
the law knew it had a murder to
investigate.
BRODY
(dangerously quiet)
It's kind of lucky for you I didn't
kill Geiger.
MARLOWE
You can hold your breath for it, just
the same.
BRODY
You think you got me framed.

66.
MARLOWE
Don't go simple on me, Joe.
you there was a witness.

I told

BRODY
(suddenly seeing the light)
Carmen! That little... She would -just that!
Vivian reacts to this -- Marlowe puts his hand strongly on
her shoulder, holding her quiet!
MARLOWE
(laughing)
I thought you had that picture
of her.
For a moment nobody moves. There is a feeling of predatory
animals; caged and waiting. Vivian looks slowly up into
Marlowe's face. Then Brody puts his gun down on an end
table by his chair.
BRODY
Let's all calm down here. Let's all
just sit quiet a minute and think.
(to Marlowe)
Who are you? And what do you get
out of this?
MARLOWE
I'm just a guy paid to do other
people's laundry. And all I get
out of it is those pictures of
Carmen.
BRODY
What pictures?
MARLOWE
(as to a child)
Oh, Joe!
He sits down beside Vivian again, talks to her as though
Brody were not present.
MARLOWE
How do you like that? He drops the
whole thing in my lap, and then he
says "What pictures"?
(to Agnes)
Poor Aggie. I hate to think of you
standing outside the gas chamber
watching him while he chokes.

67.
AGNES
(to Brody)
Joe...
BRODY
Shut up.
(to Marlowe)
How did you get to me?
MARLOWE
I never saw so many streets leading
to one place in my life. Everywhere
I turn I fall over Joe Brody -- and
I been doing a lot of turning.
BRODY
So Carmen says I gunned him.
MARLOWE
With the photos in hand, I might be
able to convince her she was wrong.
BRODY
(after a pause, scowling)
I'm not saying I have or haven't
got the photos. I'm only saying
I'm broke. Agnes and I are down to
nickels, and we got to move on for
a while till this Geiger thing cools
off.
MARLOWE
No dough from my client.
BRODY
(to Vivian -- with
cold fury)
So you did go to somebody after all.
(rising)
All right! I don't need your five
grand. I can take you off my back,
Marlowe, and I can get the cops taken
off. I got a connection, see? I got
a handle on something big enough to
turn this town upside down -MARLOWE
Why haven't you pulled it?
BRODY
I'm going to. And what I get out
of it will make your five grand look
like a roll of nickels.

68.
AGNES
Joe -- you're not gonna do it. You
can't go up against Eddie Mars,
he'll -BRODY
(furiously)
Shut up! You have to let that big
mouth run off in front of -He is interrupted by the sudden RINGING of the DOORBELL.
They hold it, all of them apprehensive of who may be on the
other side of the door, while the RINGING STOPS and becomes
an insistent rapping. Brody jerks open a desk drawer and
draws out a bone-handled automatic, which he hands out to
Agnes. She takes it, shaking nervously. Brody indicates
Marlowe.
BRODY
(to Agnes)
If he gets funny, use your own
judgment -- and the dame, too.
Agnes sits on the arm of the davenport beside Marlowe, the
gun out of sight against him. Marlowe, observing her
shaking hand, is not happy. Brody puts his own gun in his
pocket, leaving his hand on it, and opens the door. Carmen
Sternwood pushes him back in the room, using a tiny
revolver which she pushes against his hips. Carmen kicks
the door shut behind her; Agnes leaps up, standing out of
Marlowe's reach, her gun wavering between him and Carmen.
She remains oblivious of the other people in the room.
Vivian reacts to her entrance, but says nothing. Marlowe
sits still, automatically stroking the sleepy cat.
CARMEN
(to Brody, with quiet
viciousness)
I want my pictures, Joe.
Brody is scared, playing it very easy, backing up as she
follows him.
BRODY
Take it easy, Carmen.
MARLOWE
(sharply, eyeing Agnes)
Carmen...
AGNES
(to Carmen)
Get away from him, you.

69.
Vivian rises sharply, also getting out of Marlowe's reach;
she whips a small automatic out of her coat pocket.
VIVIAN
(to Agnes, trying to
watch her and Brody
at the same time)
Let her alone.
(to Brody, moving
toward him)
Joe, if you dare to hurt her...
MARLOWE
This is cute. Hasn't anybody else
got a gun? -- We can play ring
around the roses.
CARMEN
(ignoring them
all -- to Brody)
You shot Arthur Geiger.
I want my pictures.

I saw you.

MARLOWE
For Pete's sake, all of you -relax!
No one hears him. The three women continue to behave like
nervous cats -- the lead may start flying at anybody, any
minute. Brody still has his hand in his pocket; he may
blast Carmen -- and Marlowe, gunless, sits in the middle of
the possible crossfire. Vivian is closer to him than
Agnes, having moved beyond the hampering arm of the couch.
Marlowe moves abruptly. Grabbing the couch cushion which
Vivian has just vacated, he slings it at Agnes, knocking
her off balance and down.
Almost as a continuation of the same movement Marlowe makes
a dive for Vivian's legs. She falls on top of him, they
struggle for the gun, and Vivian bites Marlowe's wrist. He
whacks her across the side of the head with his free hand,
wrenches the gun free and stands up. Carmen's attention
has been distracted slightly by this dust-up, and Brody
strikes at her gun hand. The gun goes off, making a small
sharp crack, shattering a pane of glass in the French
windows, then skitters out of Carmen's hand and across the
floor. Agnes lets go a frightened bleat and collects
herself, about to fire at Carmen. Marlowe makes a quick
rush, kicks the gun out of her hand, and puts his foot on
Carmen's gun just as Carmen gets there, her hands and
knees, reaching. She puts her hand on Marlowe's foot, and
then looks up at him, sidewise, and giggles. He bends over
and pats her on the back.

70.
MARLOWE
Get up, angel. You look like a
Pekinese.
She draws back and rises as Marlowe scoops up her gun with
his left hand and drops it in his pocket. The gun he has
taken from Vivian still dominates the room.
MARLOWE
Everybody -- stand still.
They do, and he walks over and picks up Agnes' gun,
sticking that on in his hip pocket. Brody is wiping the
nervous sweat off his face -- Agnes and Vivian still crouch
half stunned on the floor. Marlowe laughs.
MARLOWE
My, don't we have fun! You can get
up now, kiddies.
(walking over to Brody)
All right, Joe. Give.
Brody goes sullenly to the desk, opens a secret compartment,
and pulls out a fat envelope, hands it to Marlowe. Marlowe
glances at the contents.
MARLOWE
Sure this is all of it?
BRODY
Yeah. Now will you dust, so I can
air out the room?
Marlowe turns as the Sternwood girls approach him. Carmen
gives him a languishing smile and holds out her hand for
the envelope.
CARMEN
Can I have them now?
MARLOWE
I'll take care of them for you.
He hands the envelope to Vivian, who thanks him with her
eyes.
MARLOWE
(to Carmen and Vivian)
You'd better go on home now.
Carmen continues to look at him, sidelong, biting her thumb.
CARMEN
You'll take care of Carmen, won't you?

71.
MARLOWE
Check.
CARMEN
Could I have my gun back?
MARLOWE
Later.
CARMEN
You're awfully cute.
MARLOWE
Yeah.
(stopping Vivian
as she passes
him, heading
toward the door)
Countess -- you forgot something.
He picks up her bag off the davenport and hands it to her
-- the scene's almost a repetition of the one in Marlowe's
office, with Marlowe still holding the handbag.
MARLOWE
Did I hurt your head much?
VIVIAN
(softly)
You -- and every other man I
ever met.
She goes out. Carmen follows her, but at the door she
turns impulsively, flings her arms around Marlowe's neck
and kisses him.
CARMEN
I like you.
She runs off down the hall. Marlowe looks at her, puzzled
by her unusual attitude. He closes the door and turns
again to Brody and Agnes. Agnes, considerably scratched
up, gives him a snakely glare as she pats her wounds with a
handkerchief.
BRODY
I got enough of you, chum.
MARLOWE
Yeah, but there's still some
unfinished business. What's this
handle you got on Eddie Mars that's
big enough to turn the town upside
down?

72.
BRODY
Listen -- you got your pictures -you got nothing more on me. Get
outta here.
MARLOWE
Sure, I can go. You can go, too.
Up to Quentin, to the big chair in
the little room with the window. They
stand outside, Joe, with stopwatches.
They clock you in seconds, but from
where you sit the centuries stink of
cyanide, and they wrap around your
throat, and a lot of people say it's
easier than hanging -- I don't know.
BRODY
What are you trying to do?
MARLOWE
Keep your neck out of a noose -- in
return for some information. Got an
alibi for last night?
BRODY
I was right here with Agnes.
MARLOWE
(picking up his hat)
Okay, Joe. You can only die once,
even for a couple of murders.
Brody stares at him as he turns to leave.
-- she puts her hand on Brody's shoulder.

Agnes is scared

BRODY
Wait a minute. What do you mean -a couple of murders?
MARLOWE
But then, you don't have to worry,
do you? You got a connection.
BRODY
Sit down.
MARLOWE
(laughs, sits down
on table edge)
Where were you about seven-thirty
last night?

73.
BRODY
(sullenly)
Watching Geiger's place, to see if
he has any friends too big for me to
kick out of the way when I take over
his business. It's raining hard,
I'm shut up in my car, and I don't
see anything except another car
parked in the alley below Geiger's.
I look at it -- it's a Buick,
registered to Mrs. Rutledge. That's
all. Nothing happened, and I got
tired waiting and went home.
MARLOWE
Know where that Buick is now?
BRODY
How would I?
MARLOWE
In the Sheriff's garage. It was
fished out of twelve feet of water
off Lido pier this morning. There
was a dead man in it, Owen Taylor,
the Sternwood's chauffeur -- the guy
you got the pictures from. He'd
been sapped and the car pointed out
the pier and the hand throttle
pulled down.
Brody gives Marlowe a stricken look.
grip on him.

Agnes tightens her

AGNES
Joe, you didn't...
BRODY
Shut up.
(to Marlowe)
You can't hang that one on me.
MARLOWE
I can make a good try -- unless
you talk and talk straight.
BRODY
All right, all right! Yeah, I
heard the shots. I see this guy
come slamming down the back steps
with something in his hand.
(MORE)

74.
BRODY (CONT'D)
He shoots off in the Buick, and I
follow him, and out of the highway
he skids off the road and has to
stop, so I stop too, and play cop.
His nerve is bad, and I sap him
down -- and I figure the film might
be worth something, so I take it.
That's the last I see of him.
MARLOWE
Uh-huh -- so Taylor gave Geiger the
works, and ail for the love of little
Carmen. Agh! The sap!... How'd you
know it was Geiger he shot?
BRODY
Seemed like a good guess. When I
saw what was on the film I was sure,
and when Geiger didn't show at the
store this morning, Agnes and I
figured it was a good time to do
ourselves some business.
MARLOWE
Yeah, you figured, all right. You
businessed yourself right into a
hot box.
BRODY
Yeah -- yeah, I guess I did.
MARLOWE
I got connections too, you know,
with the D.A.'s office. If I know
about Eddie Mars I might be able to
cool you down some.
AGNES
(as Brody hesitates)
Go on, Joe -- tell him!
BRODY
Okay. It's kind of a funny story.
It ain't about Eddie Mars, really
-- it's about his wife. I...
The DOORBELL starts to RING. Brody stands up, with Agnes
beside him. Marlowe stays put.
BRODY
So she's back again.

75.
MARLOWE
If she is, she doesn't have her gun.
Don't you have any other friends?
BRODY
(crossing to the
table, picking
up the Colt)
Just about one.
(going angrily
to the door)
I got enough of this.
He opens the door about a foot, with his left hand, holding
the Colt ready by his thigh. It is impossible to see who
stands in the hall. Almost instantly two shots sound,
close together. Brody doubles up, falls forward against
the door, slamming it shut. Agnes reacts, but does not
scream. Marlowe leaps up, hauls Brody away from the door
-- Brody is quite dead. Marlowe runs out.

INT. HALLWAY - THE RANDALL ARMS - NIGHT

peers out of a doorway, pointing to the stairs. The SOUND
of RUNNING FEET comes from the treads below. Marlowe races
to the stairway and down.

come, crouching for shelter behind the line of parked cars.
Aside from him the street is deserted.

Lundgren stands still, taken by surprise, not sure what to
do. His hand rises instinctively to his leather jacket,
but not inside. A siren wails off, going toward the
Randall Arms -- Lundgren turns his head instinctively
toward the sound, and Marlowe steps in against him, the
little gun jammed into Lundgren's midriff.
MARLOWE
Me, or the cops?
LUNDGREN
Get away from me.
MARLOWE
This is a small gun, kid. I can
give it to you through the belly and
in three months you'll be well
enough to walk the last mile up at
Quentin.

Lundgren holds it, glaring at Marlowe, then relaxes.
LUNDGREN

Get into my car, kid.

-- slowly)
Under the wheel. You drive.

and Marlowe gets in beside him, keeping him covered.
MARLOWE
Let's go to Laverne Terrace -Geiger's house.
(pleasantly -- as
Lundgren starts
the car)
And by the way, Carol -- if you shot
Brody for friendship's sake, you shot
the wrong guy.
Lundgren gives him a hard, nasty look and laughs.
MARLOWE
(softly)
Not all friendship, was it? Yeah,
money talks, all right. It talks,
and it's breath smells of blood...
(laughing to himself)
I told Brody that sometimes punk
burns...

EXT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - AT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
Marlowe and Lundgren stand on the footbridge. Marlowe
still carries the toy gun. He pulls the keys out of his
pocket with his left hand and gives them to Lundgren.
MARLOWE
You open it.
Lundgren starts to take the keys, then slams Marlowe a
quick, hard punch on the jaw. Marlowe rocks back, but
doesn't fall -- he smiles and throws the gun down at
Lundgren's feet.

78.
MARLOWE
Maybe you need this.
Lundgren goes for the gun. As he bends down Marlowe steps
in fast, bringing his knee up into Lundgren's face. The
force of the blow straightens Lundgren up, and Marlowe
uncorks a terrific left. Lundgren falls heavily. Marlowe,
unperturbed, unlocks the door, puts the gun back in his
pocket, and starts to drag Lundgren inside.

Lundgren is stretched out on the couch, his hands bound
behind him, under his back. A single lamp shines down into
his face. He has bled somewhat from the nose. Marlowe
sits on the couch, twisted sideways, so that Lundgren's
head is strained back over his knee. Marlowe helps the
straining by having his left hand wound in Lundgren's hair.
His manner is gentle, almost friendly.
MARLOWE
(softly)
You're going to cop a plea, brother -don't ever think you're not. And
when you talk, you're going to say
just what I want you to say, and
nothing else. You hear me, sweetheart?
Lundgren makes no reply, staring stonily into the light.

on the couch, both hands over his face.

INT. GEIGER'S BEDROOM - MARLOWE AND OHLS - NIGHT
They stand by the bed, looking down. Geiger is laid out
on the bed. Two strips of Chinese embroidery cover the
wounds on his breast, in the shape of a cross, his hands
folded over them. The only light in the room comes from
two black candles burning on either side of the bed.
OHLS
Nice gesture of friendship.
Lundgren?
MARLOWE
Yeah.
Ohls bends over, lifts up the Chinese embroidery, studies
Geiger's chest, then straightens up.
OHLS
So that's where the three slugs went
out of Owen Taylor's gun. Well, I
can understand that.

of distaste)

succeeding scenes.

behind his desk. He wears a dinner jacket, has been called
hastily from a party obviously. At corner of the desk sits
Captain Cronjager of the city police homicide detail, in
plain clothes. He is a cold, hatchet-faced man obviously
displeased with the way things have happened. Ohls enters,
followed by Marlowe.
OHLS
(to Wilde)
Evening, Chief. Evening, Cronjager.

chair to sit down)
Meet Sherlock Holmes, gentlemen.
(to Marlowe)
Grab yourself a chair -- unless
you'd rather be on your feet while
Cronjager gives you a going-over.

WILDE
Sit down, Marlowe. We'll try to
handle Captain Cronjager. But I
think you'll admit you were going a
little fast, won't you?
MARLOWE
Thanks.
He sits down, takes out a cigarette, holds it unlighted in
his hand. Ohls and Cronjager stare at him.
OHLS
Fast is right. But just wait and
watch him go when his foot finally
does slip.
(to Cronjager)
Maybe you'd better tell Sherlock
Holmes here what else you got on
the Randall Place killing.
CRONJAGER
A blonde. Down on the street,
trying to start a car that didn't
belong to her. Hers was right next
to it, the same model. She acted
rattled, so the boys brought her in
and she spilled. Claims she didn't
see the killer.
OHLS
(still riding Marlowe)
He's in the back office now -handcuffed. Here's the gun.
He takes Carol's gun from his pocket, drops it on the desk.
Cronjager looks at the gun, but without touching it. After
a moment Wilde chuckles, enjoying Cronjager's discomfiture
and Ohls' annoyance.
OHLS
But that's just one of them.
(he stares at Marlowe
while he addresses
Cronjager)
You heard about a car being lifted
out of the surf at Lido pier this
morning with a dead guy in it?
MARLOWE
(mildly)
Do you have to be coy about it?

82.
OHLS
(staring at Marlowe
-- addressing
Cronjager with
malicious sarcasm)
Sure. The guy they found drowned in
the car shot another guy last night
in your territory; a guy named Geiger
who ran a racket in the back room of
a bookstore on the boulevard. The
punk I got in the back office worked
for Geiger.
(to Marlowe)
You're on the air. Let's have it.
MARLOWE
That's all. When I finally located
the lad that moved the packing case
out of Geiger's back room, Geiger's
blonde secretary was with him. It
was Brody. While I was trying to
persuade Brody to tell what became
of the packing case, the doorbell
rang again and Brody opened the door
and somebody shot him twice. You
know the rest of it.
(he lights his cigarette)
OHLS
Except what was in the packing case
-- yes.
MARLOWE
(smoking)
Brody didn't tell me.
OHLS
(staring at Marlowe)
You see, Cronjager? Even as smart
as he is, he's got to guess
sometimes, too.
MARLOWE
My guess is the same as yours.
Black mailing stuff. Geiger's
customers must have been wearing a
path across that rug, coming in to
knock on that locked door and pay
their monthly installments.

83.
OHLS
(staring at Marlowe)
That's right, Cronjager. Maybe
Sherlock's even going to show us
his evidence for guessing that.
MARLOWE
Do you folks still guess when you
have evidence?
WILDE
(sharply)
That's enough of this.
(to Marlowe)
So Taylor killed Geiger because he
was in love with the Sternwood girl.
And Brody followed Taylor, sapped
him and took the photograph and
pushed Taylor into the ocean. And
the punk killed Brody because the
punk thought he should have
inherited Geiger's business and
Brody was throwing him out.
MARLOWE
That's how I figure it.
WILDE
(extends his hand)
Let's see your evidence.
OHLS
Give, pal. Hiding murders.
Spending a whole day foxing around
so that this punk of Geiger's can
have plenty of time to commit
another one.
Marlowe takes from his coat and puts on the desk before
Wilde the three notes and Geiger's card to General Stern
wood, and the notebook with its code list of names. Wilde
looks at them, lights a cigar. Ohls and Cronjager rise and
look at the articles over Wilde's shoulders. Marlowe
smokes quietly.
WILDE
(after a time)
These notes. If General Sternwood
paid them, it would be because he
was afraid of something else. Do
you know what he was afraid of?
MARLOWE
No.

84.
Wilde stares at Marlowe.
WILDE
(after a moment)
Have you told your story complete?
MARLOWE
I left out some personal matters.
(they stare at each other)
I intend to keep on leaving them out.
WILDE
Why?
MARLOWE
I've still got a client. You
recommended me to him through Bernie.
My first duty is to him.
Wilde, Ohls and Cronjager all stare at Marlowe. He smokes
quietly. Wilde, staring at Marlowe, makes a slight signal
with his hand.
OHLS
(to D.A.)
Okay. But you're wasting time.
If you'd let me handle Sherlock...
WILDE
That'll do, Bernie.
OHLS
(to Cronjager)
I want to surrender a prisoner
to you. Come on.
(he goes toward door
-- Cronjager following.
As Ohls opens the door
he pauses and looks
back at Marlowe. To
Marlowe:)
I like you. Better and better.
Some day I'm going to like you so
well I won't be able to bear having
you out of my sight.
He and Cronjager exit, close the door. Wilde puffs his
cigar, staring at Marlowe. Marlowe smokes quietly.
WILDE
(after a time)
Do you know why I'm not tearing
your ear off?

85.
MARLOWE
I expected to lose both of them.
WILDE
(smoking -- watching
him steadily -after a time)
What are you getting for all this?
MARLOWE
Twenty-five a day and expenses.
WILDE
And for that money you're willing to
get yourself in Dutch with the law
enforcement of this county, maybe
lose your license?
MARLOWE
(quietly)
I've still got a client.
WILDE
Is he still just a client?
(Marlowe doesn't
answer -- smoking)
Listen to me, son. My father was a
close friend of old General
Sternwood. I like him as well as
you do. I've done all my office
permits -- maybe a good deal more -to save him from grief. But in the
long run, nothing can save him
except dying.
MARLOWE
Yeah -- the big sleep.

That'll cure

WILDE
It cures all the grief... You really
don't know yet what General Sternwood
wants with you?
MARLOWE
Yes. To settle this business with
Geiger.
WILDE
He's afraid that ex-bootlegger,
Regan, that he took up about a year

Wilde shrugs slightly.

Maybe you'd better find him and

Maybe I had.
Marlowe rises.

He indicates the objects on the desk.

MARLOWE
Can I have these?
Wilde looks again at the objects, then he takes up the

occupant, sitting with a newspaper in a lobby chair, lowers
the paper. It is the young hoodlum who was with Mars at
Geiger's house this morning. He rises, flicks his
cigarette stub into a potted palm and thrusts the tip of
his right hand into the V of his coat-opening.

Well, well, if it ain't Hawkshaw

The other receiver clicks. Marlowe puts his receiver down
slowly, sits a moment, thoughtful. He seems to be waiting
for something. He takes out a cigarette, has just struck
the match when the phone rings. Without moving he blows
out the match and wedges the paper stem into the telephone
bell, muffling it, so that it now merely buzzes, steadily
as whoever it is continues to ring. Then he strikes
another match, lights the cigarette, rises and begins to
unknot his tie as he walks out of SHOT. The muffled
telephone buzzes, the light snaps off, leaving the room in

MARLOWE

Mind if I smoke?
GREGORY
Go ahead.
MARLOWE

Thanks.
GREGORY
What do you want?
MARLOWE
I want to know what became of a man
named Shawn Regan, who used to work
for General Sternwood.

91.
GREGORY
I don't know where he is. He
scrammed -- pulled down the curtain,
and that's that.
MARLOWE
Will you give me what you have got
on him?
Gregory rings a bell on desk-edge. The door opens, a
middle-aged woman secretary enters.
GREGORY
Get me the file on Shawn Regan,
Abba.
The woman exits. Marlowe smokes. Gregory takes up a
charred pipe, digs tobacco dottle deliberately from it, is
about to fill it when the woman enters, lays an official
file on the desk, exits. Gregory puts down the pipe, puts
on glasses, opens the file.
GREGORY
He blew on the sixteenth of September.
No one reported it. We got into it
by finding the car. It was the
chauffeur's day off, so nobody at
Sternwood's saw Regan take his car
out of the garage. We found the car
four days later in a garage belonging
to a ritzy bungalow court on Sunset.
The garage man reported it to the
stolen car detail; said it didn't
belong there. We couldn't find who
it belonged to.
MARLOWE
And of course Eddie Mars' wife
couldn't tell you, because she had
disappeared too.
GREGORY
(stares at Marlowe
a moment)
If you knew so much already, why
did you come to me?
Sorry.

MARLOWE
Go ahead.

GREGORY
So you have been talking to some
Sternwood about Regan.

92.
MARLOWE
Why not? You just said nobody has
accused anybody of any crime yet.
GREGORY
Yes, Mrs. Mars was gone too,
disappeared within two days of
the day Regan's car was left in
the garage.
MARLOWE
What are the angles?
GREGORY
Mrs. Mars lived in the apartment the
garage belonged to. Regan was known
to carry a roll, fifteen grand, in
his clothes all the time -Yes.

MARLOWE
I had heard that.

GREGORY
It don't seem to have been any secret
to anybody that Regan was sweet on
Mars' wife.
MARLOWE
So it looks like they went off
together.
GREGORY
Regan had fifteen grand in cash with
him. Mrs. Mars had some rocks, and
a car of her own -- making two cars
available. Everything disappeared
but one of the cars.
MARLOWE

GREGORY
You're thinking of Eddie Mars.
You're wrong. Mars is a business
man, and a good one. Jealousy's a
luxury -- murdering for it, at least
-- that a man like Eddie Mars knows
he can't afford.
MARLOWE
So, as far as you're concerned, Mars
is out.
GREGORY
Mars is out. And, until something
more turns up, we are too.
MARLOWE

And so am I, it looks like. There's
no law on my book either against a
man with fifteen grand going away
with the woman he loves.

comfortable chairs, etc. Mars wears a well-cut, expensive
dinner suit. He shakes hands with Marlowe as the bodyguard
withdraws, shuts the door.
MARS
(shaking hands)
Took you a long time to get here,
didn't it?
MARLOWE
I wouldn't be here now if you hadn't
hinted you had something for me.

(turns to liquor cabinet,
opens it, starts to

What did you change your mind about?
About what you are after, or just
about admitting it?
Marlowe, lighting a cigarette, doesn't answer. Mars

Thanks.
Mars leans against the desk, elegant, holding his drink.

A friend of yours is outside playing

Mrs. Rutledge -(Marlowe says nothing,
drinks)
I liked the way you handled that
yesterday. You made me sore at first.
But I see now you knew what you were
doing. You and I ought to get along.
(Marlowe says nothing,
drinks, smokes. Mars
watches him)
But I like to pay my checks as I go
along. How much do I owe you?
MARLOWE
For what?

MARS
Still cagey, huh?
MARLOWE
All right. How much have you got
that I can use?
MARS
(waves hand, easy)
Oh, that. I heard you had all
the information already.
MARLOWE
I don't know. You didn't bump
Regan off, did you?
No.

MARS
So you think I did?

MARLOWE
I came up here to ask you.
MARS
(stares at Marlowe)
You're kidding.
MARLOWE
Yes, I'm kidding. I used to know
Regan. You haven't got the men
for that work. And while I think
of it, don't send me any more gun
punks. I might get nervous and
shoot one of them.
Mars stares at Marlowe, lifts glass and drinks, staring at
Marlowe across the glass, lowers the glass.
MARS
You talk a good game, but I still
think we can get along. Are you
looking for Regan, or not?
MARLOWE
Geiger was trying to blackmail
General Sternwood. I finally
figured out that at least half the
General's trouble was being afraid
Regan might be behind it.

So if it was just Geiger you were

I guess that's what the General thinks
too since he paid me off today.
(Mars takes up Marlowe's
empty glass)
No thanks. No more.
MARS
Another won't hurt you.
MARLOWE
No thanks.
MARS
(sets glass down)
I'm sorry about that. I wish
Sternwood would hire you on a
straight salary to keep these girls
of his home at least a few nights
a week.

sets it down, wipes
his mouth)
They're plain trouble. The older
one's a pain in the neck around here.
If she loses, she plunges, and I end
up with a fist full of paper not even
worth the ink on it. If she wins,
she takes my money home with her.

From what I hear she's not the kind
of a wife a guy wants to lose.
Could it be you know where she is -with Regan?

Look, soldier... What's between me
and my wife is between us.

Okay.

room, which is big, spacious, various small lay-outs along
the wall. At the end of the big room are three roulette
wheels. The two outside ones are deserted; even the
croupiers have been drawn into the crowd which is packed
densely about the middle one. In the center of the crowd
VIVIAN'S HEAD can be seen as she plays her winning streak.
Marlowe is watching her. On the fringe of the crowd the
waiters stand also, watching. All this is a build-up to
show a phenomenal run which Vivian is making. The barman
leans on the bar behind Marlowe
BARMAN
She's sure picking them tonight.
She comes here a lot, and from the
way it's been running for her, she's
due to pick them. Put it's been a
long time since this place seen

Two men emerge from the crowd about the wheel and approach
the bar, excitedly. The barman moves to them, waits.

Scotch and soda.

drinks. The speaker
mops his face)
Boy, I never saw such a run. Eight
wins and two stand-offs in a row on

What kind of a cheap outfit is this?
Get busy and spin the wheel. I want

to dishing it out, you begin to

behind the table. The crowd falls silent, turns, as Mars
comes out the door, smiling, indifferent, immaculate, hands
in his jacket pockets as he strolls to the table.

inner breast pocket a large pinseal wallet with gold
corners, very elegant, and tosses it carelessly to the
croupier without opening it.
MARS
Cover her bet in even thousands.
(to the gaping crowd)
If no one objects to this turn of
the wheel being for the lady alone.
The crowd remains breathless. Vivian leans down and shoves
the whole mass of her winnings savagely onto the RED
diamond of the layout, stands back. The croupier leans
without haste and rapidly and skillfully counts the money,
stacks it, places all but a few scattered chips and bills,
rakes these into a neat pile and pushes it off the layout
with his rake, leaving the bet on the RED.
Then he opens Mars' wallet with the same detached deliberate
swiftness, draws out two flat packets of thousand-dollar
bills. He breaks the tape around one, counts off six
bills, adds them to the unbroken packet, puts the four
other bills back into Mars' wallet and lays the wallet
aside as carelessly as if it were a packet of paper
matches. Mars does not touch the wallet. He stands as
before, elegant, detached, courteous. The croupier spins
the wheel with one hand, snaps the ball into it with the
other, draws back and folds his arms.

regretful, shrugs, thrusts pipe into his side-pocket, his
hand still clutching it, goes on moving quietly and
stealthily now, pauses, listens again, is about to go on

steps quickly and soundlessly into the shrubbery.

CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE
hidden behind a shrub, peering out. Ten feet away another
man crouches behind a shrub beside the path, watching the
path. He turns his head; we see that he wears a mask. He
watches the path again, reacts as FAINT SOUND OF FEET
begins. Vivian enters, walking rapidly along the path,
clutching her handbag to her. As she passes the shrub, the
man steps quickly out. Vivian stops but makes no sound.
THUG
(quickly; low-tone)
This is a gun, lady. Gentle now.
Just hand me the bag.
For a moment Vivian does not move. Then she draws a
deep breath as if to scream, still clutching the handbag.
THUG
Yell, and I'll cut you in half.

bag, thrusts his
hand inside)
It better be here --

Hi, pal.
(the thug stops dead.
After a second his
empty hand starts
to steal upward)
Easy now.
As Marlowe and the thug stare it out tensely, two shadowy
figures emerge from the shrubbery. One of them slugs
Marlowe from behind. As he falls, the other grabs for
Vivian, apparently about to do the same for her. She lets
out a wild scream and starts shooting from the pocket. One
of the thugs cries out in mingled pain and anger -- in the
distance people begin to shout -- the noise has attracted
attention.
THUG
You clumsy yap...
SECOND THUG
Let's get outta here.
They run, vanishing into the dark shrubbery. Vivian
crouches beside Marlowe, helping as he tries to sit up.

VIVIAN
(easily; lifts the
handbag, slaps it)
This, for instance. And tonight's
not the first time.
MARLOWE
Which would make Eddie Mars sore.
So we'll pass that and start over.
What's he got on you?
VIVIAN
Wittier, please, Marlowe.
I can't.

Wittier.

MARLOWE
I'm too old to learn now.

VIVIAN
But not old enough to outgrow some
of your other habits.
MARLOWE
For instance?
VIVIAN
Killing people.
(she stares at him,
secretive, while
he tries to follow
her, catch up with
what's going on)
So you're a killer.
MARLOWE
Does that mean Geiger, or Brody -or maybe both of them?

109.
VIVIAN
Why not?
(she looks at him.
Suddenly her manner
changes; she speaks
with a quiet and
complete sincerity)
I wish I was sure you had done it.
Then I could thank you -- in my
father's name. He still has pride,
at least.
MARLOWE
And you and your sister haven't.
VIVIAN
(with bitter contempt)
Carmen and me...
(rapidly)
We're his blood. That's where the
hurt is. That Father might die
despising his own blood. It was
always wild, but it wasn't always
rotten.
(she pulls herself
together, takes out
a cigarette, slumps
back in the seat as
Marlowe strikes a
match. But when he
holds the match to
her, he sees her
lying back in the
seat, the cigarette
in her mouth, looking
at him with lazy and
inviting challenge.
When he brings the
match near, without
moving she blows it
out. When she speaks
it is almost a whisper)
Move closer.
Marlowe stares at her. After a moment he flings the dead
match deliberately away, puts his arm around her,
approaches his face to hers. Suddenly Vivian flings the
unlighted cigarette over her shoulder toward the window,
clasps him in her arms.
VIVIAN
Hold me close!

They kiss, a long kiss.

Marlowe raises his head at last.

VIVIAN
Where do you live?
MARLOWE
Hobart Arms.
VIVIAN
I've never seen it.
MARLOWE
Would you like to?
VIVIAN
Yes.
MARLOWE
What's Eddie Mars got on you?
She is motionless in his arms for a second. Then she
flings him back with one arm, sits violently up.
VIVIAN
So that's the way it is.
MARLOWE
That's the way it is.
VIVIAN
(controls herself;
takes out a wisp
of handkerchief
and scrubs her lips
savagely with it)
Men have been shot for less than
this, Marlowe.
MARLOWE
Men have been shot for less than
nothing. The first time we met I
told you I was a detective. Get
it through your lovely head. I
work at it, lady. I don't play
at it.
VIVIAN
What makes you think Eddie Mars has
anything on me?

111.
MARLOWE
He lets you win a lot of money,
then he has a gunpoke meet you in
the back yard and take it all away
from you. And you're not even
surprised. You don't even thank
me for saving it for you.
VIVIAN
Do I need to tell you what I think
of you, Mister Detective?
MARLOWE
You don't owe me anything. Your
father paid me. I owe you something
for the kiss.
VIVIAN
Let me congratulate you on keeping
your head.
MARLOWE
Maybe I didn't.
VIVIAN
Take me home.
Marlowe starts the oar again, drives on.

INT. MARLOWE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
As Marlowe enters, closing the door behind him. The only
light in the room filters in from a street lamp outside.
Marlowe flings his hat carelessly toward a chair, evidently
out of long habit, and starts across the room toward the
kitchen, in search of a drink and in too much of a hurry to
bother turning on lights.

123.

INT. MARLOWE'S APARTMENT - REVERSE ANGLE FROM KITCHEN NIGHT
As Marlowe approaches, his body filling the f.g. As he
reaches the kitchen door a lamp goes on suddenly behind
him. He freezes, his body blocking the view of what is
behind him. Then, as he turns slowly, we see past him -Carmen Sternwood sits in an armchair, the one, in fact,
into which Marlowe has pitched his hat. Carmen holds it
up, smiling. She wears an evening gown, more or less
covered by a light wrap.

CARMEN

What does the hatcheck girl get for

MARLOWE
(grimly)
I'm trying to think of something
appropriate -- How did you get in

CARMEN

MARLOWE

cigarette)
Bet I can. You came in through the
keyhole, like Peter Pan.
CARMEN
Who's he?
MARLOWE
Guy I used to know around the
poolroom.
CARMEN

MARLOWE
And getting cuter every minute.
did you get in?

How

CARMEN
I showed your manager your card. I
stole it from Vivian. I told him you
told me to come here and wait for you.
MARLOWE
Fine. Now tell me how you're
going to get out.
CARMEN
(slipping off her wrap)
I'm not going.
She looks at him -- a surprisingly honest, steady look.
This is a different Carmen -- a puzzled, half-frightened
girl who seems to be waking from a dream -- not sure she
wants to, but unable to help herself. Marlowe looks back
at her, nastily. But he senses a difference, and his voice
is surprisingly gentle when he speaks.

113.
MARLOWE
Listen, Carmen. I'm tired. I've
had a hard day's work. I like you,
I'm your friend, and any other time
I'd be tickled to death to see you.
But not now. Will you please go
home?
CARMEN
(quietly, hungrily)
Are you really my friend, Phil?
MARLOWE
Sure...
CARMEN
I need a friend, Phil... someone
to -She stops, apparently confused, groping for words.
MARLOWE
Someone to what, Carmen?
CARMEN
I don't know.
She looks up at him again, searching his face. As though
Marlowe is a magnet, she is drawn to her feet, still
looking at him. She comes close, but does not touch him.
CARMEN
(almost to herself)
What is it in you?... I'm afraid of
you, and yet... there's something
straight and hard... Phil, I wish
I'd met you before -- a long time
ago...
MARLOWE
(trying to Josh
her out of it)
Hey, hey... What's all this?
CARMEN

Why did you have to come?

MARLOWE
Look -- you and I want to go on
being friends -- and you shouldn't
be here.
(holding her
wrap for her)
Be a good girl.
During this speech, Carmen seems to take the wrap. But the
wrap falls on to the floor, revealing the fact that Carmen
is holding Marlowe's hand.
CARMEN
Do you think I can be a good girl?
MARLOWE
It doesn't matter what I think.
Carmen kisses his hand.
CARMEN
But don't you want me to try?
MARLOWE
(trying to free his
hand now)
I just want you to get out of here.
CARMEN
(clinging to his hand)
You've got funny thumbs. Can I
bite it?
Before he can answer, she raises his hand, starts to put
his thumb into her mouth. With a sharp violent motion he
flings her hand away.
MARLOWE
Stick to your own thumb. Hasn't it
carried you all right all your life?
CARMEN
(obediently)
All right.
She puts her thumb in her mouth, or her hand to her face in
such a way as to appear to be sucking her thumb as usual.
Marlowe takes up the fallen wrap and approaches with it.

115.
MARLOWE
Okay. Take your thumb now and
get out of here.
CARMEN
(giggling)
It's not my thumb.

See?

She removes the object from her mouth and holds it up for
him to see. It is the white queen from his set of
chessmen. Marlowe stares at her for a moment, then he
slaps her terrifically across the face, rocking her back.
The chessman falls from her hand and she stares at Marlowe,
frightened now, as he walks toward her.
CARMEN
Do that again.
MARLOWE
(seething with
repressed rage;
almost whispering)
Get out.
CARMEN
Maybe if people had done that to me
more often, I would have been good
now.
Marlowe reaches her, grasps he arm, hurries her across to
the door, jerks the door open, almost hurls her through it,
flings the wrap after her, slams the door, turns the bolt
as she rattles the knob, then begins to hammer on the door.
He turns and crosses the room rapidly to the bath while she
still beats on the door, and washes his hand savagely with
soap and water, his face now actually beaded with sweat.
The KNOCKING CONTINUES. He examines his hand, is still not
satisfied, jerks open shaving cabinet, looks at the
innocuous bottles of mouthwash, etc., when what he needs is
carbolic acid, goes to the kitchen while the knocking still
continues, jerks savagely from the shelf his last bottle of
whiskey.
It is about half full. He jerks the stopper out, flings it
away and pours about a dollar's worth of expensive Scotch
over his hand, flings the bottle away, returns to the
living room, and while the KNOCKING STILL CONTINUES, he
kneels at the hearth, lays the delicate chess piece on it
and with a heavy fire-dog hammers the chess-piece into
dust, still beating even after the piece has vanished, his
blows at last drowning out the SOUND of the knocking on the
door.

JONES comes up to him. Harry is small, hardly five feet,

through a small stack of mail on his desk. Jones watches

Eddie don't like it. And what
Eddie don't like ain't healthy.

You know why I went to the peeper.
Account of Joe Brody's girl. She's
got to blow. That takes dough.
She figured the peeper could get
it for her.
CANINO'S VOICE
Dough for what?
JONES
You know about the night the kid
bumped Brody? Well, the young
Sternwood girl was there. She not
only dropped in, she took a shot
at Brody. Only the peeper didn't
tell the cops that. So Agnes figures
it's railroad fare for her as soon as
she can get hold of the peeper. You
get it?

the dash light, then puts them in her handbag.
AGNES
This is a getaway stake, copper.
I'm on my way. What happened to
Harry?
MARLOWE
I told you he ran away. Canino got
wise to him somehow. Forget Harry.
I've paid for information and I want
it.
AGNES
You'll get it. Joe and I were out
riding Foothill Boulevard a couple
weeks ago. We passed a brown coupe,
and I saw the girl who was driving.
She was Eddie Mars' wife. There
was a guy with her -- the watchdog,
Canino. They're people you don't
forget, even if you only saw them
once. So we got curious, and Joe
tailed them. About a mile east of
Realito there's a side road, and
nothing around it but brush and
hills. Just off the highway there's
a two-bit garage and paintshop run
by a guy named Art Huck -- hot car
drop, likely -- and a frame house
behind it. That's where Eddie Mars'
wife is holed up.

130.
MARLOWE
(studying her coldly)
You're sure of that?
AGNES
Why should I lie?... Well, goodbye,
copper -- wish me luck. I got
a raw deal.
Yeah.

MARLOWE
Your kind always does.

He turns and opens the door to get out.

secret compartment with two guns in it. He weighs them,
selects the heavier of the two, and draws it out. The flap
swings shut.
156.

EXT. HIGHWAY - AT HUCK'S GARAGE - NIGHT (RAIN)
Marlowe approaches the garage. There is a sign on the
blank side wall -- Marlowe holds a flashlight on it, and we
SEE the lettering of the sign:
ART HUCK
AUTO REPAIRS -- PAINTING
Marlowe goes round to the front. The big doors are closed,
but a streak of light shows through the crack. Marlowe
hesitates, then walks past them to glance at the house.

EXT. HUCK'S GARAGE - NIGHT (RAIN)
At the door, as Marlowe goes up and hammers on it with the
butt of his heavy flashlight. There is a moment of
silence. Then the inside light goes off. Marlowe centers
his flash in a white circle of light on the doors.
HUCK
(speaking through
the door)
Whaddaya want?
MARLOWE
Open up, I got two flats back on
the highway and only one spare.
HUCK
Sorry, mister. We're closed up.
Better try Realito.
Marlowe doesn't appreciate this. He kicks the door, hard,
and keeps on kicking it, until a second voice -- Canino's
voice -- speaks from close inside. Then he stops to
listen.
CANINO'S VOICE
Okay, Art -- open up for the wise
guy.
A BOLT SQUEALS, and half the door opens inward. Marlowe's
flash outlines a gaunt hard face, Huck's face. Then Huck
swings a gun down across the flash, knocking it out of
Marlowe's hand, still burning.
HUCK
Kill that spot, bud.
Marlowe picks up the flash, turning it off. Light goes on
inside the garage, revealing HUCK, a tall man in dirty
coveralls. He backs away from the door, keeping Marlowe
covered.
HUCK
Come inside and shut the door.

159.

INT. HUCK'S GARAGE - NIGHT
as Marlowe closes the door behind him. There is the usual
paraphernalia of a garage, and two cars. One is being
painted, a spray-gun lying on the fender, the other is
Carmen Sternwood's Packard convertible. Canino lounges
easily in the shadows by the bench. The RAIN BEATS on the
tin roof.

133.
MARLOWE
(indicating Huck's gun)
You could scare off a lot of trade
that way.
HUCK
I'm too far out of town to take
chances.
(pointedly)
You can get yourself hurt, kicking
on doors.
CANINO
(softly)
Cut it out, Art. You run a garage,
don't you?
MARLOWE
(not looking at Canino)
Thanks.
(to Huck)
I suppose you can fix flats.
HUCK
(putting the gun
in his pocket)
As good as you can make 'em, bud.
But right now I'm busy.
CANINO
(pleasantly)
Art -- you got time to fix his
tires.
MARLOWE
You can use my spare -- that'll
help some.
HUCK
Listen, I told you I'm busy with
a spray job...
CANINO
It's too damp for a good spray job,
Art. Get moving -- and take two
jacks.
HUCK
Now wait a minute...
Canino looks at Huck with a soft quiet-eyed stare, then
away again, not saying anything. Huck wilts and moves
away, pulling on a raincoat and banging out with a socket
wrench, a hand jack, and wheeling a dolly.

Canino closes the door behind him and returns to the
workbench. Marlowe watches silently, lighting a cigarette.
CANINO
Bet you could use a drink.

MARLOWE
Thanks.
Canino produces a bottle and two glasses from under the
bench, pours two shots, and hands one to Marlowe. They
salute -- Canino drinks, and Marlowe, remembering Harry
Jones and the cyanide cocktail, hesitates, then drinks
also.
CANINO
(casually)
Live around here?
MARLOWE
No. Just got in from Reno and
Carson City.
CANINO
The long way round, huh?

Partly.

MARLOWE
And in a hurry.

CANINO
Too bad -- you may have a long wait.

empty glass)
How about another, to pass the time.

EXTREME CLOSE - A WHEEL - NIGHT
-- the tire already on a spreader and loose from the rim.
A man's hands and feet working at the job viciously. The
CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Art Huck as he rips out the tube.
Marlowe and Canino stand almost as before, by the
workbench.
HUCK
(grumbling over
above action)
I don't have enough to do -- guys
have to get flats in the middle of
a cloudburst.

CANINO
(laughing)
Don't crab so much. You can use
an extra bath.
(taking a roll of
coins out of his
pocket, tossing
them idly in the
palm of his hand)
Just get busy.
Huck carries the tube to an airhose and starts to fill it.
HUCK
I am busy, brother.
busy.

Plenty

He starts to place the tube in the galvanized tub under the
hose, then turns swiftly, lifting the tube high, and brings
it down over Marlowe's head and shoulders, a perfect
ringer. Marlowe, unable to reach the gun in his pocket,
bends forward, trying to throw Huck over his back. Canino
steps in lightly, like a dancer, his hand closed hard over
the roll of coins, and hangs one with delicate precision on
Marlowe's jaw.
Marlowe's tough -- he goes on fighting, although he's
already out on his feet. Huck pulls his head back by the
hair as Canino clips him again with the weighted fist.
Marlowe tries, but it's no use. He goes down and stays
that way.
161.

INT. MARS' HIDEOUT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A small room, in keeping with the exterior -- furnished
comfortably but not luxuriously. The only light comes from
a floor lamp beside the davenport where Marlowe lies. His
hands are cuffed behind him, his feet roped to the leg of
the davenport. He is still out, his face considerably the
worse for wear. Vivian sits beside him on a straight
chair, holding a half empty glass in her hand. She seems
to have forgotten about it. She seems to have forgotten
everything but Marlowe -- who begins to come out of it. He
opens his eyes presently and looks at Vivian -- he doesn't
seem surprised. He winces and shuts his eyes again.
MARLOWE
(thickly)
Move the light, honey...
Vivian rises and turns the light away from his face.
looks up at her again.

He

MARLOWE
(still groggy)
That's better -- where are the
boys -- out digging a grave?
VIVIAN
(desperately)
Phil, why did you have to go on
with this?
MARLOWE
Why did you?
Vivian turns away from him -- she's obviously keyed up,
scared, desperate.
VIVIAN
I've only known one fool as big as
you...
MARLOWE
(after a pause)
You might spare me a little of that
drink you're not using.
Vivian goes to him, sits down, and holds the glass to
Marlowe's lips, then touches his battered face with her
fingertips.
VIVIAN
(shakily)
Your face looks like a collision
met...
MARLOWE
It won't last long, even this good.
(after a pause,
looking up at
Vivian softly)
I'll give it back to you -- I've
only known one fool as big as you.
They hold it, a twisted uncomfortable moment, and then MONA
MARS enters. She is tall, blonde, strikingly beautiful -a woman who knows her way around, yet having a certain
dignity and fineness.
MARLOWE
You would be Mrs. Eddie Mars... the
blond that Shawn Regan didn't run
away with.

137.
MONA
Why did you have to make trouble?
Eddie wasn't doing you any harm.
I was never in love with Shawn -we were just good friends. But
you know perfectly well that if
I hadn't hid out here when Shawn
disappeared, the police would have
been certain Eddie killed him.
MARLOWE
(quietly)
But he did kill him.
MONA
(after a pause,
with quiet dignity)
Eddie's not that sort of man.
MARLOWE
You mean Eddie never kills people.
MONA
No.
MARLOWE
You really believe that, don't you?
And in a way, I suppose you're right...
MONA
(sincerely)
I'm married to Eddie Mars. I love
him. I know what's inside of him.
MARLOWE
Well, if Eddie's such a nice guy,
I'd like to talk to him without
Canino around. You know what Canino
will do -- beat my teeth out and then
kick me in the stomach for mumbling.
VIVIAN
You'll get your talk, Phil.
gone for Eddie.

Canino's

MARLOWE
Leaving Art Huck within call, I
suppose. Well, I suppose nobody's
luck holds forever.
(to Vivian)
You could really have gone to Mexico,
you know. You'd have liked it better.
Blood doesn't spatter that far.

138.
MONA
Oh, stop talking that way!
Vivian and Marlowe are no longer conscious of her presence,
having retired into a private world of their own.
MARLOWE
But then you couldn't go, could you.
The border police would have checked
you through alone, and too many
people might have seen you -without Shawn Regan. Much safer to
come down here with Mona. Much
safer -- especially for Eddie Mars.
VIVIAN
I did it as much for you... Why
wouldn't you believe me? Why
wouldn't you stop?
MARLOWE
Too many people tried to make me.
And besides I knew Shawn Regan -and I know you.
They look at each other -- and Mona Mars takes herself
quietly out of the room.
VIVIAN
Why did I have to meet you? Why
out of all the men in the city, did
my father have to call you in?
MARLOWE
Things happen that way, sometimes...
Light me a cigarette...
She takes one from a table, lights it, and bends over to
place it between Marlowe's lips. Marlowe's eyes hold her
as though his hands were on her shoulders; she sits down.
MARLOWE
(softly)
You know what they're going to do,
don't you? You know the only thing
they can do.
Vivian's hands grip the shoulders of his coat. She shuts
her eyes and drops her head, holding herself rigid.

139.
MARLOWE
(still softly)
It's not pretty, is it -- even from
a distance. And when you're right
on top of it, it isn't pretty at all.
VIVIAN
(rising abruptly)
Oh, stop it, Phil. Stop it!
Nothing's going to happen...
MARLOWE
Mona's in love with Eddie Mars, but
you're not. Are you going through
with it?
Vivian moves away, as far from him as she can get, and
stands with her back to him, rigid, staring at the
curtained window as though she could see through it.
Marlowe studies her, then laughs, a quiet sardonic chuckle
and relaxes, leaning back on the cushion.
MARLOWE
Pride is a great thing, isn't it?
And courage -- and honor -- and
love. All the things you read about
in the copybooks -- only in the
copybooks nothing ever gets tangled.
The road always lies so straight,
and clear, and the signs say to love
and honor and be brave... Take this
thing out of my mouth, will you,
honey? It's burning me.
Vivian comes slowly to him and takes the cigarette stub
from his lips. She hesitates, then goes down onto the
couch, dropping the cigarette on the floor. Her arms go
around Marlowe, her mouth crushed to his. When she breaks
for air, putting her cheek against his, she is almost
crying. Marlowe is far from unmoved himself, turning his
head against hers, hard.
MARLOWE
(after a pause, whispering)
Get a knife, and cut this rope
off me...
Vivian rises, runs out of the room. The SOUND of a kitchen
drawer being opened comes OVER from o.s., then the RATTLE
of CUTLERY. Vivian returns almost at once with a knife and
slashes the rope from Marlowe's feet. Dropping the knife,
she helps him get up -- he's not too steady on his legs.
They cross the room together, Vivian with her arm around
Marlowe. The handcuffs glittering on Marlowe's wrists.

140.
From outside comes the SOUND of a car skidding to a stop.
Mona Mars appears in the doorway, holding a gun.
MONA
(quietly, without menace)
Eddie is here -- I think you'd
better wait.
162.

EXTREME CLOSE - CANINO'S HAND
opening, playing idly with the roll of coins. The CAMERA
PULLS BACK -- we are still in the living room. Marlowe is
sitting on the couch, Vivian beside him -- his hands are
still cuffed behind him, but his feet are free.
Canino leans unobtrusively against the wall -- near
Marlowe. Eddie Mars holds center stage, moving like a lion
keyed up for the kill. Mona Mars, the gun forgotten in her
hand, sits in the b.g., watching. Her face is still,
intent.
VIVIAN
(quietly)
Eddie -- this is where I get off.
MARS
You bought a ticket for the whole
run, Countess -- destination unknown.
Keep your mouth out of this.
(to Marlowe)
You're making it tough for me,
soldier.
MARLOWE
Not me, Eddie. Murder. Murder can
make things tough for anybody. You
keep tripping over it, all the time.
MARS
(contemptuously)
Murder! I haven't killed anybody.
MARLOWE
Not personally, maybe -- but your
hand is behind Canino's, aiming the
gun -- or pouring the cyanide into
Harry Jones' glass.
(as Mars gives him
a startled look)
Yeah -- I was there, in the next
room. Canino had a gun and I
didn't, so all I could do was
watch... I kind of liked Harry
Jones.

141.
MARS
You kind of like too many people,
soldier.
MONA
Eddie -- what does he mean? What's
happened? Who was Harry Jones?
MARS
He's just talking. Maybe you better
get out, Mona. We may have to push
him around a little before we get
through.
MARLOWE
(to Mona)
Yeah -- push me a little, right
over the edge. Eddie won't spoil
his manicure to do it -- but
Canino won't mind. He's used to
having his hands dirty.
Canino leans over and slaps Marlowe hard across the face.
Vivian springs up, toward Canino -- Eddie Mars grabs her,
looking toward Mona. Mona has never seen that look on
Eddie's face before.
MARS
(quietly)
Get out, Mona.
MONA
Eddie...
MARS
Get out.
Mona studies him -- it seems that she is looking at a
stranger, a stranger who frightens her, someone evil and
beyond the pale. She seems to grow in stature and dignity,
even as her heart realizes how far down the wrong road it
has traveled. She turns, then, slowly, and goes out.
After she has gone, Vivian wrenches free from Mars' grip.
There is something rather wonderful about her now -- a
blazing, catlike courage. She faces Eddie Mars.
VIVIAN
You don't dare go through with this,
Eddie.
MARS
You think I can't get away with it?

142.
VIVIAN
You think I'm going to let you
get away with it?
Mars studies her, then Marlowe -- realizes what the score
is, and smiles sardonically.
MARS
You women kill me. You'll spend
years and wreck lives to get
something you want, and then
throw it all away in a minute
because some guy has a new way
of putting his mouth on yours.
(sitting down,
easily, smiling)
All right, Countess. While we're
doing all this thinking... do you
think you're going to have a chance
not to let me get away with it?
Silence as this sinks in. Vivian sits down quietly beside
Marlowe, who looks at both her and Mars with a cold,
cynical smile.
MARLOWE
(laughing softly)
It's amazing how fast a beautiful
friendship breaks when a dead body
falls on top of it... Which one
of you killed Regan? If he was
shot in the back, I'll bet on you,
Eddie, because that's the only way
you could have got to him. But if
he took it from the front -(looking at Vivian)
I can see how you both would have
been jealous of Mona.
Vivian stares at him, a hard, shocked look as though
Marlowe is something not human. Marlowe gives it back to
her -- then almost at once Canino steps forward and places
his hand on Marlowe's head, bending it back, his fingers
and thumb biting cruelly into Marlowe's temples. Canino
smiles, as though he is very fond of Marlowe.
CANINO
(gently amused)
Ever see a dick with such a one-track
mind? He's sitting right on the edge
of a hole in the ground, but he still
cares who killed Regan. Want to tell
him, Eddie? Want to send him to bed
happy?

143.
Mars makes an annoyed gesture and starts to get up, then
freezes as Mona speaks from the doorway.
MONA
(very quietly)
Eddie...
Everyone turns to look at her -- there is a quality of fate
in her voice. She leans almost negligently against the
door jamb, wearing a heavy coat, holding a big felt hat in
her hands.
MONA
I've been a good wife to you, Eddie
-- as good a wife as you'd let me
be. I believed in you, and there
wasn't anything I wouldn't have done
for you -- anything but this.
MARS
Don't be a fool, Mona.
see...

Can't you

MONA
(slowly)
I can only see one thing. I've been
married to a killer, and I've helped
him kill.
She turns and goes out.

Mars rises, looking after her.

MARS
(to Canino)
Hold the fort, Canino.

I'll be back.

He goes out after Mona, not even waiting for Canino's nod
of assent. Canino goes to a window and peers through the
crack of the blind, still keeping Marlowe covered. We HEAR
a car start outside and drive off.
CANINO
(sardonically)
He made it. And he can talk about
love.
He turns back into the room. Vivian has risen, she stands
by a table lighting a cigarette with a wooden match from a
box which she retains in her left hand.
163.

INSERT MATCH BOX IN VIVIAN'S HANDS:
An ordinary small box of matches. The cover has been
pushed almost shut, leaving the head of one match
protruding.

Vivian holds the flaming match with which she has just

I can have a lot more fun alone.

Canino's face, then turns aside, clutching her scorched
fingers.

Phil!
Marlowe throws himself forward into Canino's legs -- they
roll, struggling.

167.

CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE AND CANINO
as Canino comes out on top of Marlowe, at an angle, and
whips his pistol down at Marlowe's head. Marlowe wrenches
aside -- the gun barrel misses by a fraction, smacking hard
on the carpet. Marlowe doubles his knees into his chest
and lets go with his feet, getting both heels under
Canino's jaw. Canino goes backward and down, dropping his
gun, but he's not clear out -- the blow was glancing. He
grabs Vivian as she tries to get by him, pulling her down.
Marlowe manages to get the gun in his shackled hands.
Canino pulls another, fires at him, misses, tangled up with
Vivian. Marlowe makes it out the door.

EXT. MARS HIDEOUT - AT THE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT (RAIN)
As Marlowe comes out and runs down the steps toward
Canino's car. Over by the garage Art Huck stands, scared
but undecided. Marlowe snaps a shot at him. Huck makes up
his mind in a hurry. He vanishes -- a second later we HEAR
a car start and race off down the highway, o.s. Marlowe,
working fast but awkwardly because of the handcuffs, opens
the door of Canino's car, backs in.

169.

INT. CANINO'S CAR - NIGHT (RAIN) - MARLOWE
fumbling for the ignition key and starter button, behind
him. He starts the motor, then slides out again, quickly,
hugging the ground by the rear wheels, offside.

EXT. MARS HIDEOUT - MARLOWE'S ANGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)
As a darkened window goes up. THREE SHOTS are fired from
it. We HEAR the whine of the bullets, their impact on the
coupe. Marlowe cries out as though hit. Then again there
is silence, except for the beating rain and the purring
motor.
Presently the house door opens -- there is no light behind
it. Vivian appears, walking stiffly, and behind her is
Canino, shielded from possible fire. They walk slowly
toward Marlowe and the car.
CANINO
Can you see anything?
VIVIAN
(tonelessly)
Nothing. The windows are all
misted.
They come steadily closer to the dark car. Suddenly Vivian
stops, rigid, and lets go a thin, tearing scream.
VIVIAN
Behind the wheel!
(as though pleading
with Marlowe not
to fire)
Phil!
Canino shoves her roughly aside, dropping to one knee, and
pours three SHOTS through the car window. His gun is now
empty. No shots answer him -- he is satisfied that Marlowe
is dead. He rises, moving to open the car door, as Marlowe
emerges from behind the car.

MARLOWE
Finished?
Canino whirls around, and Marlowe, the gun pressed
awkwardly against his side, puts four bullets in him.
collapses into the mud and stays there.

He

MARLOWE
(to Vivian)
Get the keys, honey.
Vivian, white-faced and silent, gets the keys from Canino's
pocket and unlocks the handcuffs. Marlowe rubs his wrists
-- they look at each other, both tired and drained of
emotion -- there seems to be nothing to say.
MARLOWE
(quietly)
You played that hand all right,
Countess.
VIVIAN
(dully)
I don't know why I cared.
She turns and walks away from him toward the garage and her
car, not looking back. Presently Marlowe goes back into
the house.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
171.

INT. STERNWOOD HALL - MORNING - NORRIS AND MARLOWE
As Norris stands in the open door, in the act of admitting
Marlowe.
MARLOWE
The General sent for me...
NORRIS
Yes, sir. He's waiting, in the
orchid house.
Marlowe enters, walking along the hall toward the rear with
Norris. Subtly, Norris has the air of a guard. Marlowe
looks tired and somber, the marks of last night's encounter
still plain on his face. He has obviously not been home;
he wears the same rumpled suit, no tie, and he has not
shaved. Vivian comes out of an adjoining room, as though
she has been waiting, and stops them.

147.
VIVIAN
I'd like to see you, Mr. Marlowe.
She gives Norris the nod -- he goes away, and Marlowe
follows Vivian into the room, closing the door.
172.

INT. SMALL SITTING ROOM - MARLOWE AND VIVIAN
Lavishly furnished. Vivian also looks exhausted, stony,
but giving an impression of submerged but volcanic emotion.
She does not look at Marlowe.
VIVIAN
Well?
MARLOWE
I kept you out of it. I told a
straight story, and Canino left his
thumbprint on Harry Jones' door to
back me up. I don't know whether
they believed me, but there's nothing
they can do about it. I'm clear -self defense. And all Eddie Mars has
to say is that Canino was roughing me
on his own time.
VIVIAN
(looking at him
now, forced to
admire him)
It wasn't as easy as you make it
sound.
MARLOWE
(shrugging)
My neck is usually stuck out, one
way or another. It's a little
tougher than the General's, that's
all.
VIVIAN
(after an uncomfortable
pause)
It's too bad Father can't know what
you've done for him. I'm afraid
he's... angry with you.
Why not?

MARLOWE
Everybody else is.

VIVIAN
You -- won't say anything to him?

148.
MARLOWE
Of course not.
VIVIAN
Phil...
MARLOWE
(brutally)
Listen... I'm tired. I killed a
man last night. I stink of cops,
and I've still got a rotten taste in
my mouth. I want a hot bath with
strong soap, and I can't have it
until I've seen your father. Do you
mind if I go now?
VIVIAN
(going close to him)
Phil -- I didn't kill Shawn Regan.
MARLOWE
(cold, deadpan)
Is he dead?
Vivian stares at him, getting a slow, deadly look in her
eyes.
VIVIAN
(very calmly)
It's quite possible. He's been
gone a long time, and he's not a
peaceful man.
(turning away)
I'll send you my personal check in
the morning, Mr. Marlowe.
MARLOWE
Your personal check?
VIVIAN
I'm sure my father would wish you
to be repaid for your... extra
services, last night.
MARLOWE
(quietly, after pause)
I'm sure your father would know
better... and I know you do -What about Eddie Mars?
VIVIAN
What about him?

149.
MARLOWE
You think he's going to forget
all this?
VIVIAN
I'm tired, too. Get out, Marlowe.
Marlowe shrugs, goes toward the door. He speaks over his
shoulder with an air of casual politeness.
MARLOWE
How's Carmen?
Vivian, her back to him, takes the question just a little
too easily.
VIVIAN
She's fine. She went up to
Santa Barbara last night.
MARLOWE
That ought to be nice for her.
VIVIAN
Yes.
There seems to be nothing more to say.

Marlowe exits.

INT. STERNWOOD REAR GARDEN

- DAY - MARLOWE AND NORRIS

as they walk down the path toward the orchid house.
Marlowe glances around, apparently looking for something he
doesn't see. Norris opens the door, permitting Marlowe to
pass him into the greenhouse.
174.

INT. ORCHID HOUSE - MARLOWE
As he follows the path between the banks of orchids to the
place where General Sternwood sits, as before -- in the
wheelchair, wrapped in robe and blanket -- only his eyes
are alive, proud and piercing.
STERNWOOD
Sit down, Mr. Marlowe.
Marlowe pulls up a chair, already beginning to suffer with
the heat. He starts to remove his coat, then something in
Sternwood's attitude makes him change his mind.
STERNWOOD
I didn't ask you to look for
Shawn Regan.

150.
MARLOWE
You wanted me to, though.
STERNWOOD
You assume a great deal. I usually
ask for what I want.
(as Marlowe does
not answer)
The money I paid you is of no
consequence. I merely feel that
you have, no doubt unintentionally,
betrayed a trust.
MARLOWE
Is that all you wanted to see me about?
STERNWOOD
You're angry at that remark.
MARLOWE
You have an advantage over me,
General. It's an advantage I
wouldn't want to take away from you.
You can say anything you like to me,
and I wouldn't think of getting
angry. I'd like to offer you your
money back. It may mean nothing to
you. It might mean something to me.
STERNWOOD
What does it mean to you?
MARLOWE
It means I've refused payment for an
unsatisfactory job. That's all.
STERNWOOD
(after a pause)
Why did you go to Captain Gregory?
MARLOWE
I suppose I played a hunch. I
was convinced you put those Geiger
notes up to me chiefly as a test, and
that you were a little afraid Regan
might somehow be involved in an
attempt to blackmail you. Besides,
as I said -- I knew Regan. It meant
something to me to find out, too.
STERNWOOD
And you allowed Captain Gregory to
think I had employed you to find
Shawn?

151.
MARLOWE
Yeah, I guess I did -- when I was
sure he had the case.
STERNWOOD
And do you consider that ethical?
MARLOWE
Yes, I do.
STERNWOOD
Perhaps I don't understand.
MARLOWE
Maybe you don't. When you hire a
boy in my line of work it isn't like
hiring a window-washer and showing
him eight windows and saying: "Wash
those windows and you're through."
You don't know what I have to go
through or over or under to do your
job for you. I do it my way. I do
my best to protect you, and I may
have to break a few rules, but I
break them in your favor -- After
all, you didn't tell me NOT to go to
Captain Gregory.
STERNWOOD
(with a faint smile)
That would have been rather difficult.
MARLOWE
Well, what have I done wrong? Your
man Norris, seemed to think the case
was over when Geiger was eliminated.
I don't see it that way. I'm not
Sherlock Holmes. I don't expect to
go over ground the police have
covered and pick up a broken
penpoint and build a case from it.
If you think there's anybody in the
detective business making a living
doing that sort of thing, you don't
know much about cops. If they
overlook anything, it's something
much looser and vaguer, like a man
of Geiger's type sending you his
evidence of debt and asking you to
pay like a gentleman. That isn't
normal. Why did he do that?
Because he wanted to find out if
there was anything putting pressure
(MORE)

152.
MARLOWE (CONT'D)
on you. If there was, you'd pay
him. If not, you'd ignore him and
wait. But something was putting
pressure on you. Regan. You were
afraid he'd stayed around and been
nice to you just long enough to find
out how to play games with your bank
account.
(interrupting Sternwood,
as he starts to speak)
Even at that, it wasn't your money
you cared about. It wasn't even
your daughters. You've more or less
written them off. It's that you're
still too proud to be played for a
sucker -- and you really liked Shawn
Regan.
STERNWOOD
(quietly, after
a pause)
You think entirely too much, Marlowe
-- Are you still trying to solve
that puzzle?
MARLOWE
No. I've been warned to quit. The
boys at the City Hall think I play too
rough. That's why I thought I should
give you your money back -- because it
isn't a completed job by my standards.
STERNWOOD
(smiling)
Quit, nothing. I'll pay you another
thousand to find Shawn Regan. He
doesn't have to come back. I don't
even have to know where he is. A
man has a right to live his own
life. And he must have had his
reasons for running off like that.
I only want to know that he's all
right. I want to know it from him
directly, and if he should happen to
need money, I should want him to
have that also. Am I clear?
MARLOWE
Yes, General.
Sternwood leans back in the chair, his eyes closed wearily.

153.
STERNWOOD
(trying to smile)
I guess I'm a sentimental old goat,
and no soldier at all. Find him for
me, Marlowe. Just find him.
MARLOWE
(rising)
I'll try. You'd better rest now.
I've talked your arm off.
He starts away.

Sternwood's voice stops him.

STERNWOOD
(quietly)
You have a lot that Shawn had.
Strength -- and a steady eye.
Marlowe stands a moment, remembering Vivian's words.
he turns quietly and goes away.
175.

Then

GREENHOUSE DOOR - MARLOWE
as he emerges, mopping again, finds Norris waiting for him,
already holding Marlowe's hat for him. Marlowe, surprised
at this, is still further surprised when he looks up and
sees his car, which he left in front of the house, now in
the drive not far away and already turned so that it is
headed back toward town.
NORRIS
I took the liberty of turning it
around for you, sir. Since you were
in the greenhouse, I brought it on
around here at the same time.
MARLOWE
(ironically)
So that now I won't lose hardly any
time getting back to work, huh?
NORRIS
(impenetrable)
You will always be welcome here, sir,
if only to receive our gratitude.
MARLOWE
(stuffs handkerchief
into pocket, takes
his hat, turns)
Thanks.

154.
He walks toward the car. But still Norris walks beside
him. Marlowe already realizing that he is being
practically frog-walked off the place. They reach the car.
Norris steps ahead, opens the door, holds it open for
Marlowe to get in.
MARLOWE
You don't even need a gun, do you?
NORRIS
I've never had occasion for one, sir.
I don't think I ever will.
MARLOWE
Neither do I.
(nods toward greenhouse)
What do you think of him this morning?
NORRIS
He's stronger than he looks. As
you would see for yourself if
occasion arose -- which, thanks to
you, it will not now.
MARLOWE
Yeah -- what did Regan have that got
to the General so?
Youth, sir.

NORRIS
And the soldier's eye.
MARLOWE

Like yours.
NORRIS
Thank you, sir. And yours.
MARLOWE
Thanks.
(he starts to get
into the car, Norris
still holding
the door)
So Miss Carmen went to Santa Barbara.
Yes.

NORRIS
This morning.

MARLOWE
(getting into car, stops)
Mrs. Rutledge told me she went last
night.

NORRIS
(smoothly)
It was near midnight, sir. I
thought it was later. I was
probably wrong.
MARLOWE
I see.
He gets in. Norris shuts the door.
engine, puts car in gear.

Marlowe starts the

MARLOWE
If the General has any more trouble,
you know how to call.
NORRIS
And whom to call. Thank you
again.
Marlowe drives on. In the mirror he can see Norris
standing in the drive still watching him, guarding the
house which Marlowe realizes he is not to enter again.
DISSOLVE TO:
176.

INT. MARLOWE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
Marlowe has just entered. He kicks the door shut, crosses
the living room, shedding his hat and suit coat on the
floor as he passes.

177.

INT. MARLOWE APARTMENT - BEDROOM
as Marlowe continues on his way to the bath, still peeling.
He vanishes into the bath -- we HEAR the shower turned on.
In the bedroom the PHONE RINGS. Marlowe returns, picks up
the phone.
MARLOWE
Yeah?
The voice of Eddie Mars comes clearly from the instrument.
MARS' VOICE
Hello, soldier.
MARLOWE
Hello, Eddie. I been waiting to
hear from you.

156.
MARS' VOICE
Got a little news for you, soldier.
I'm skipping the manicures, till I
finish up this job.
MARLOWE
Yeah, I kind of thought you would.
I got a T.L. for you, too, Eddie.
Sternwood offered me a thousand
bucks to find Shawn Regan. I took it.
MARS' VOICE
(softly, after a pause)
Maybe I can help you earn that
grand. You remember that stuff that
Joe Brody moved out of Geiger's back
room?
MARLOWE
Yeah.
MARS' VOICE
Well, I tracked it down where Joe
stashed it, and moved it back up to
Geiger's place after the cops got
through. You might take a look at
it.
MARLOWE
Yeah -- I might.
MARS' VOICE
(laughing softly)
After last night I'm beginning to
think you're as tough as you look.
I told you we could do business
together. So long, soldier.
MARLOWE
Be seeing you.
The receiver clicks. Marlowe sets his instrument down
slowly, looks at it a moment, then returns to the shower,
dropping his shirt in the doorway.
DISSOLVE TO:
178.

INT. MARLOWE'S APARTMENT -

BEDROOM

as Marlowe comes out of the bath, buttoning his pajama
coat. He is freshly shaved, his hair still damp and
rumpled from the shower. He pulls down the shades, putting
out the daylight, and collapses into the bed.

157.
Just as he is comfortably settled, already half asleep, the
doorbell RINGS. It rings insistently, with a quality of
nervous urgency. Marlowe finally gets up to answer it,
pulling on a dressing gown.
179.

INT. MARLOWE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
as Marlowe admits Vivian. She is obviously in a fine state
of nerves. She enters quickly -- he shuts the door.
VIVIAN
Phil...
MARLOWE
All right, now what?
VIVIAN
Eddie Mars just called me.
out to get you.

He's

MARLOWE
We knew that a long time ago.
VIVIAN
But now you must believe it.
must get out of town -- now.

You

MARLOWE
You better sit down, baby, and
catch your breath.
He sits down on the davenport.
VIVIAN
Phil, how do you feel about me?
MARLOWE
Just like I feel about a stick of
dynamite. Smooth on the outside -but it makes a mess when it goes off.
VIVIAN
I got a different idea last night.
Or maybe you're not a man except
when two or three people are trying
to murder you.
They kiss -- one of those kisses.

Vivian frees herself.

VIVIAN
Now go. At once. I'll give you
money -- a thousand -- five thousand
if you'll get out of town now -today...

158.
MARLOWE
That would be stage money. I like
to earn my money. I can't earn that
much at one time, but what I do earn
doesn't smell bad to me.
VIVIAN
Would you get out of town if you
knew Shawn Regan was dead?
MARLOWE
Is Shawn Regan dead?
VIVIAN
Would you?
MARLOWE
How did he die?
VIVIAN
Kiss me.
MARLOWE
Later -- maybe. How did Shawn die?
VIVIAN
I killed him. By accident. He was
teaching me to shoot and the gun
went off.
MARLOWE
And that's what Eddie Mars has got
on you. And so he sent you here,
to buy me off with you.
Vivian stares at him, slaps him viciously across the face.
Marlowe takes it.
MARLOWE
Will you have the kiss now, too?
She slaps him again.

He takes it.

MARLOWE
You're good, you're very good, but
you can't do it, baby. It won't wash.
VIVIAN
You fool, I killed him, I tell you.
Just as you're going to be dead if
you don't get out of town. Don't
you see Eddie Mars can't let you
stay alive now?

159.
MARLOWE
Eddie never developed that trouble
this morning. Now I'll ask you one.
what's your game with me?
VIVIAN
There's no game -- with you.
MARLOWE
You've been playing spin the bottle
with me ever since I met you. It's
'please, Phil' one minute, and 'get
out, Marlowe' the next. You haven't
told me a straight truth since the
first day...
VIVIAN
That's a lie. I'm trying to play
straight now. You fool, don't you
realize you're going to die if you
stay here?
MARLOWE
No. All you've told me is that you
want me out of town at any price -and that you still believe I can be
bought if you can just find the
right currency. Sure I'm a fool. I
try to do my job and keep my nose
clean. I risk my whole future, the
hatred of the cops and Eddie Mars'
gang. I dodge bullets and eat saps.
But I'm not supposed to feel
anything about it either way,
because anybody can buy my immortal
soul with a few bucks -- or maybe
just a kiss. Sure, I'm a fool.
She stares at him, her eyes blazing. Suddenly she raises
her hand, but before she can slap him, he speaks and she
pauses.
MARLOWE
That's right. Have another. I
throw them in free to old clients.
She stops, stares at him, suddenly takes his face between
her hands, stares at him.
VIVIAN
You're going to find Shawn Regan?
MARLOWE
Yeah.

160.
VIVIAN
No matter who gets hurt?
MARLOWE
No matter who gets hurt.
VIVIAN
(letting her hands
drop to his shoulders)
All right, Phil. It's funny -- I
think I really like you now, for
the first time.
She turns to the door, her head high, her voice very cool
and steady. Only her eyes, hidden from Marlowe, tell how
she feels.
VIVIAN
Goodbye, Phil.
She goes out.

EXT. HOBART ARMS - AT FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
as Marlowe comes out, wearing a hat and trench-coat against
the rain which has begun to fall. He gets into his car and
drives off. As he does so, a second car, a dark convertible
seen indistinctly in the shadowy street, swings around the
corner behind him, slows, falters, then picks up speed,
following Marlowe.

181.

EXT. LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)
as Marlowe drives slowly, cautiously toward Geiger's house.
The street is dark, deserted. Marlowe drives without
lights. He stops in the tree-shadows by the angle of
Geiger's hedge and slides quietly out of the car, keeping
close to the hedge. His gum gleams faintly in his hand.

182.

EXT. LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)
A section of the road over which Marlowe has just come.
The dark convertible creeps along in the shadows, also
without lights. It is still impossible to see who is
driving.

183.

EXT. GEIGER'S PLACE - NIGHT (RAIN)
as Marlowe makes his way like a stalking cat through the
garden, toward the front door. Nothing stirs. There is no
sound but the rain. Marlowe crosses the exposed bridge at
a crouching run.

161.
Nothing happens. He pauses in the shadows by the front door,
then tries the knob. Silently the door swings open. He
waits, then darts swiftly inside.
184.

EXT. LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)
The dark convertible, still shrouded in the heavy shadows
of the trees, parks quietly behind Marlowe's car across the
road.

185.

INT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
Marlowe stands beside the door, which he has closed,
listening. He is only a shadow among shadows. The house
is utterly still. Marlowe, still cautious, crosses into
the rear part of the house, then returns.
MARLOWE
(laughing softly)
Okay, Eddie. I get it -- on the
way out.
He draws the heavy curtains quickly across the windows,
turns on the lights and sheds his hat and coat. The
packing box from Geiger's back room stands on the hearthrug. Marlowe bends over to look inside.

186.

INSERT: THE PACKING BOX
filled with manila filing envelopes, ledgers, etc. On the
top of the stack is a folder labeled "Sternwood". It has
obviously been placed there on purpose.

187.

INT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
Marlowe picks up the folder -- a KNOCK SOUNDS on the front
door. Marlowe reacts, dropping the folder, and raises his
gun. He moves quickly to turn out the lights, then stands
beside the door, flat against the wall.
MARLOWE
Yeah?
CARMEN'S VOICE
Phil -- let me in.
MARLOWE
(after a pause,
unlocking the door)
Come in fast and shut the door behind
you.

162.
He retains his wary position while Carmen obeys. When he
is sure she's alone, he sighs, relocks the door and turns
on the lights. His face is beaded with sweat, his hand
shaking slightly. Carmen is lightly clad, without hat or
coat. Apparently she has left home in a hurry.
CARMEN
Did I scare you?
MARLOWE
(dryly)
No -- I was expecting visitors...
I thought you were in Santa
Barbara.
CARMEN
They had me locked in my room.
They even had my clothes locked
up. But I climbed down the drain
pipe. I had to see you again.
MARLOWE
Why did you come here?
CARMEN
You were just driving away when I
got to your place. I followed.
She is obviously wrought up, in a highly emotional state.
MARLOWE
It must have been important.
CARMEN
It was. Phil, I -- I'm sorry about
the other night.
MARLOWE
Forget it.
CARMEN
I can't. Phil, you... I don't know
quite how to say this... have you
ever seen something, perhaps in a
dream? Something perfect and
beautiful, a long way off, and you
try to reach it but there are too
many things in your way?
Yeah.

MARLOWE
I know what you mean.

163.
CARMEN
Maybe if everything had been
different -- if I hadn't been born a
Sternwood, if my mother had lived -if I'd known a man like you before...
Oh, Phil, is there ever any way back?
MARLOWE
That depends.
CARMEN
(softly, intensely serious)
You could help me find the way.
He looks at her, saying nothing.
childlike, pleading.

She comes closer to him,

CARMEN
Phil, you've got to help me. I'm
getting lost. I don't know where
I'm going any more, and I'm scared.
MARLOWE
Why me, Carmen?
CARMEN
Because... Just because you came
into the house, and I saw you. Just
a little thing like that. Don't you
understand, Phil? You've got
something I need, some thing I've
got to have. Strength, maybe. I
don't know. But I've got to have
it, or -- I don't know what's going
to happen to me.
She puts her hands on his chest, looking up into his
face. For once she's completely honest.
MARLOWE
(quietly)
Was that what you wanted from
Shawn Regan?
She draws away from him, very slowly, her eyes changing,
hardening, becoming wary.
CARMEN
Perhaps... Phil...

164.
MARLOWE
(gently)
I'm sorry, Carmen. That's how it
goes. People have to find their
own way -- wherever they're going.
You can, if you really want to.
He turns away, to let Carmen have that moment to herself.
MARLOWE
(after a pause)
Before you go... I have something
that belongs to you.
CARMEN
(dully)
What?
MARLOWE
Your gun. I've been carrying it
around, thinking I'd see you.
He hands her the little gun, out of his coat pocket.
MARLOWE
Careful of it, now. It's cleaned
and loaded in all five.
CARMEN
(taking the gun)
Thanks.
Marlowe moves past her, as though to open the door.
CARMEN
Turn around.
He does so -- she has the gun leveled, and there's no doubt
what she's going to do with it.
MARLOWE
Carmen!
CARMEN
It's Vivian, isn't it?
MARLOWE
That has nothing to do...
CARMEN
It was Vivian with Shawn, too.
always Vivian.

It's

165.
She fires point blank as Marlowe takes a step toward her,
continues to fire, four shots in all. Then she waits until
he has almost reached her and thrusts the pistol almost
into his face. He catches her wrist just before she fires,
pushes her hand aside as the shot goes off. She snatches
her hand free, steps back, hurls the pistol at his chest.
It falls to the ground. He stoops and picks it up.
MARLOWE
So that's the way it was with Shawn.
CARMEN
(dazedly)
But he died... why didn't you?
MARLOWE
I blanked the shells.
CARMEN
(still stunned, breathless)
You knew I -- You knew -MARLOWE
I sort of figured it that way. And
I'd like it better if Shawn had
taken it in the back after all, from
Eddie Mars. -- He was teaching you
to shoot, wasn't he? That's what he
thought he was doing. Only you
didn't fire at the target.
CARMEN
(with half-dreamy
vindictiveness)
No -- they put him in the sump -down where the old wells are.
MARLOWE
Couldn't you have found a cleaner
place?
CARMEN
He didn't mind.
MARLOWE
No. I suppose oil and water are
the same as wind and air when you're
dead... So Vivian paid Eddie Mars,
and covered up for you.
CARMEN
Yes. You'd like to do something
about it, wouldn't you? But you
can't. I'm always safe.

166.
MARLOWE
How do you figure that?
CARMEN
Because Vivian won't let you. And
you won't do it, anyhow. You like
my father, just as Shawn did. You
know what would happen if you took
me into court. Pictures, and long
columns in the newspapers, and the
Sternwood name all over the
headlines. You know what that would
do to father.
A pause.

She is looking at him like a wicked changeling.
CARMEN
And Vivian's in on this, too. Way
in. You wouldn't want to see her
go to prison.
MARLOWE
No. I wouldn't want that. And
the old man. I wouldn't want to
kill him -- for you.

His attitude is one of defeat. Carmen is pleased,
triumphant. Marlowe turns away dejectedly, picks up his
hat and coat.
MARLOWE
(not looking at her)
Better take these, Carmen, it's
raining.
CARMEN
Thanks.
She puts them on quickly, then stands looking at Marlowe.
CARMEN
I think I'm glad I didn't kill you.
This is going to eat you. You're
going to lie awake nights, thinking
about it. And every so often you'll
see me somewhere, and I'll laugh at
you... Goodbye, Phil.
She turns quickly toward door. Marlowe steps quickly to
the light switch. As she opens the door and steps through
it, he snaps off the light. There is a brief pause -- then
gun fire.

188.

EXT. GEIGER'S HOUSE - AT FRONT DOOR
as Carmen crumples silently onto the doorstep. There is
silence. The door swings open. Presently from the dark
shrubbery Eddie Mars comes, walking slowly toward the
silent shape. His gun is in his hand. He crosses the
footbridge and moves the dead head with his foot.
Marlowe snaps the switch inside the door; light floods
suddenly out over Mars. Marlowe stands in the door, facing
Mars across Carmen's body as Mars reacts.
MARLOWE
You were a little too quick on the
trigger that time, too, Eddie.
His voice seems to break the spell. Mars goes for his gun,
starts to raise it, but Marlowe fires first. Mars drops
beside Carmen. As Mars falls, the SOUND of a man running
away through the garden comes OVER.
Marlowe whirls, snaps a shot toward the running man, takes
a few quick steps, but stops as the SOUND of a car starting
and roaring frantically away comes OVER. Marlowe turns
toward the door.

blackmail stuff, puts it in his pocket as he turns.

well there.

INT. STERNWOOD HOUSE - MARLOWE
-- as Norris opens the front door, admits him. Norris
stares at Marlowe, divines the truth by intuition.
NORRIS
It -- has happened?
MARLOWE
So you knew, too, did you? But of
course you did: she would have
needed somebody just to keep the
nightmares off. Where is she now -Mrs. Rutledge -As he speaks, Vivian enters. She stares at him as Norris
had dome, divining the truth too.
VIVIAN
Phil -MARLOWE
It's all right. I was just telling
Norris. It's all all right.
(Vivian sways)
Catch her, Norris!
Norris catches Vivian, supports her as Marlowe moves in,
puts his arm around Vivian.
MARLOWE
We've got a few minutes until the
police get here.
NORRIS
In here, sir.
They half carry Vivian out.

192.

INT. ALCOVE - VIVIAN, MARLOWE AND NORRIS IN B.G.
Vivian has recovered control now.
VIVIAN
Poor Carmen. Even after that -that -- Tell me it was quick.
MARLOWE
It was quick. She didn't even know,
probably. Eddie did. He had a good
half second to watch his coming.

169.
NORRIS
(to Vivian)
She was in the darkness, and Mr.
Marlowe turned the light on for
her -- don't you see?
VIVIAN
I know. Would you really have sent
her to -- to the -MARLOWE
(quietly)
Yes. You don't kill people for free,
you know.
VIVIAN
Yes, I know.
MARLOWE
So you gave Eddie Mars Shawn's
fifteen thousand dollars to put him
into the sump.
VIVIAN
Only it was my fifteen thousand. I
pawned the jewels mother left me. I
still have Shawn's money, hoping to
find his relatives -- if he had
relatives. Not that it matters. I
know what you must think of me.
MARLOWE
Do you? -- There's one thing
bothering me. It's not the sump.
Shawn wouldn't care about that now.
But he was a Catholic -VIVIAN
I had prayers said for him in the
Cathedral. And I brought the Father
out here, too. I couldn't lie to
him. He stood beside the sump and
blessed Shawn. I prayed too -- for
me, at least.
Marlowe puts his hand under her chin, tilting her head
back.
MARLOWE
You're okay, soldier. A little
dumber than I am, but okay.
(straightening up)
I'm going to see your father now.

170.
VIVIAN
(rising)
Yes. We must tell father -MARLOWE
Not we, unless you mean Norris and
me. You wait here. You may have
to keep Bernie Ohls from throwing
me into his basement dungeon before
I open my mouth.

INT. CONSERVATORY - STERNWOOD
-- watching as Marlowe and Norris approach him.
seems to read something by instinct.

He, too,

STERNWOOD
Come, come, what's happened to my
daughter now? Didn't you tell me
days ago that I no longer have a
heart to break?
NORRIS
It's Miss Carmen, sir -Yes?

STERNWOOD
Tell me.

MARLOWE
She's dead, sir.
Sternwood closes his eyes, otherwise he doesn't move.
Norris moves quickly and anxiously toward him, but he opens
his eyes again, as black and fierce as ever.
Well?

STERNWOOD
Am I to know how?

Norris hesitates in dread, but Marlowe speaks smoothly.
MARLOWE
It was a car crash, sir. She was on
her way back from Santa Barbara. It
was instantaneous. I don't think she
suffered at all.
STERNWOOD
And will no more -- since it was a
car crash.
MARLOWE
And there's one more thing. I
found Shawn Regan. He's all right.
Take my word for it.

171.
Again Sternwood's eyes shut, then open fierce and black
again.
STERNWOOD
But he will not return.
MARLOWE
No. He sends you his affection and
respect, but he won't come back.
STERNWOOD
Norris -MARLOWE
(interrupts)
We'll forget the pay on this. I
didn't do anything. It was dropped
in my lap -They all react as Vivian enters.
VIVIAN
Phil -- they're here.
STERNWOOD
The police?
MARLOWE
What would the police be doing here,
sir?
STERNWOOD
Yes. What would the police be doing
here. Go to your friends, sir. I
am a little tired and will ask to be
excused. Goodnight, and thank you
for everything.
MARLOWE
Goodnight, sir.
He and Vivian walk away, Norris following.
194.

INT. STERNWOOD HALL
as Marlowe, Vivian and Norris come out of the conservatory.
Norris draws ahead, them pauses.
NORRIS
(to Marlowe)
May I add my own thanks, sir?
MARLOWE
You're welcome, soldier.

172.
Norris inclines his head, then goes off down the hall.
Marlowe and Vivian give each other one of those looks, and
Marlowe takes her hand, drawing her close to him. They
follow Norris.
195.

AT THE FRONT DOOR - GROUP SHOT - OHLS ACCOMPANIED BY
POLICE
As Marlowe and Vivian approach.
OHLS
All right, Marlowe. I'm waiting
to see how you're going to talk
yourself out of this one.
MARLOWE
(laughing)
For once I'm going to tell the
truth.
OHLS
It had better be good.
MARLOWE
(turning to Vivian)
It'll be good, Bernie. It'll be
very good. Because you won't have
to hold me here. I've decided
already myself to stay.
FADE OUT.
THE END
