Freddy's theme plays hauntingly on a piano. A spark turns
into a flame that burns in our TITLES:
So Frowned the Mighty Combatants
that Hell Grew darker at their
frown; so matched they stood; For
never but once more was wither like
To meet so great a foe.
See, with that heat these dogs of
Hell advance To waster and havock
younder world. . .

Paradise lost
MATCH CUT TO:
FLAMES. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
INT. FURNACE
The flames are inside an old furnace. In it, we see a
child's doll melting. Like evidence being destroyed.
INT. BOILER ROOM - SAME
Outside the furnace, a dark figure moves. A love with knives
for fingers screeches along a metal pipe. An unseen child
SCREAMS. And then. . .only blackness.
INSERT - NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGE
The headline reads: "Child Killer Set Free." There is a
PICTURE of Fred Krueger walking down the court steps,
smiling. We HEAR: the screams of a mother, the outrage of a
father. And then, the familiar laugh of Fred Krueger. But
then, the edges of the newspaper start to cinder. . .and
burn.
EXT. SPRINGWOOD - ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SUNSET
Flames crawl up the side of an old Industrial building. A
window explodes. We hear Fred Krueger SHRIEKING inside.

2.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: PARENTS gathered around the building.
One sets a GASOLINE CANNISTER on the ground. Others hold
hands as the tortured screams crescendo inside. . .
NANCY'S MOTHER (VO)
(taken from "A Nightmare On Elm
Street)
He can't get you now. He's dead,
honey. . .because Mommy Killed him.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (CLIP: "A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET")
Nancy Thompson asleep in bed. Over the bed, Freddy literally
STRETCHES through the wall. Coming for Nancy in her dream. .
.
I/E. - VARIOUS (CLIPS: "A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET")
Distorted images fly by. . .Not too clear. . .but terrifying
and familiar. Freddy stalking in the Boiler Room...his arms
stretching across an alley...those eyes...that skin.
Horrible screams mix with Krueger's evil cackling...
But then, the tide turns. Freddy getting beaten. He's put
down with a flash of light. Send back to where he came from.
FEMALE WHISPER (VO)
. . .Freddy's Dead. . .
Blackness. But we hear a faint, labored breathing. . .
FREDDY KRUEGER (VO)
They tried to forget their fear.
Lock me away like a dirty secret.
CLOSE ON - Freddy Krueger's eye. Fire is reflected in it. We
don't know where he is, but we can feel his anger.
FREDDY KRUEGER (VO) (CONT'D)
But I found someone. Someone that'll
make 'em remember.
Blackness. And then. . . Another "theme" that sends shivers
up our spine: "Ch-Ch-Ch--Ah-Ah-Ah" Jason's stalking sound.
WE PULL OUT of the blackness. . . Through the eye holes of a
HOCKEY MASK. We see now the mask is lying on the ground. . .
FREDDY KRUEGER (VO) (CONT'D)
I've searched all of Hell for
someone like you. You're my ticket
home. . .

3.
Next to the mask, Freddy's claw breaks through the earth,
grabs the hockey mask and yanks it down.
EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
A full moon. Dark trees line a misty lake. There's a CABIN
nearby with a light on inside. It suddenly goes dark.
INT. CABIN - NIGHT
Moving her hand away from a light switch, a beautiful female
CAMP COUNSELOR looks over a row of young sleeping campers.
She checks her watch devilishly, and slips from a small
bottle of BOOZE. She heads for the door...when a VOICE
stops herYOUNG CAMPER
I had a nightmare. Will you stay
with me until I fall back asleep?
A YOUNG CAMPER (8) is standing behind her. She turns to him
with a forced smile, hiding the booze behind her back.
FEMALE COUNSELOR
C'mon, you're a big boy. Go back to
bed.
He just stands there, fear in his eyes. She suddenly scoldsGO!

FEMALE COUNSELOR (CONT'D)

He runs to bed. She shakes her head, stuffs the bottle along
with a TOWEL into her bag, and heads out the cabin's door.
The young boy is left alone in his bed, scared and shaking.
EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
She makes her way toward the lake, eventually dropping her
stuff near the water's edge. She looks around like she's
waiting for someone. Another look to her watch. Suddenly,
a NOISE from behind stops herFEMALE COUNSELOR (CONT'D)
Mike? Is that you?
She looks to the woods. Nothing there but dense trees.
FEMALE COUNSELOR (CONT'D)
What are you waiting for, an
invitation?

4.
POV FROM THE WOODS - Someone

IS watching her. But who?

She does a little clumsy striptease, giggling. She drops her
clothes, and dashes for the water. . .SPLASH
IN THE LAKE
She floats alone, staring at the shore. Waiting. FOG crawls
between the trees. She's getting nervous now.
POV FROM UNDERWATER - From the murky depths of the lake, we
see her legs kicking.
Is there someone down there with
her?
Suddenly, she gets TUGGED DOWN, as if pulled. She gasps,
reaches down in the water and pulls up: SEAWEED. It was
caught on her leg. She exhales, looking at the dark wet
clump of kelp in her hand, relieved. And that's when a
hundred tiny BUGS crawl out of it, covering her arm.
She freaks, and starts swimming frantically toward shore.
POV FROM WOODS - "CH-CH-CH--HA-HA-HA!" We know who it is.
But we don't see him. Not yet.
SHE GETS OUT OF THE WATER. . .quickly drying off, pulling
clothes on...head darting in all directions...scared...
A BRANCH SNAPS. Someone is definitely out here. It's only
forty yards to the cabin. She can make it. She pulls her
stuff together, her shoes in her hands, moving quicklyThe FOG behind her swirls as she goes. . .is that a DARK
FIGURE following her?? She picks up the pace...twenty
yards...ten..." CH-CH-CH--HA-HA-HA!"
She starts runningShe gets to the, TURNS AROUND-and there's nothing behind
her. She's safe. She exhales, feels a little silly at
being so scared. She goes to open the cabin door...but
IT'S LOCKED. She shakes the handle, checks her pocketsCLOSE ON - THE CABIN KEY in the grass by the lake.

5.

Shit.

FEMALE COUNSELOR (CONT'D)

She looks back toward the water, knows she left it there.
She looks in the window, about to knock on the glass-when the YOUNG CAMPER pops up in the window, scaring her.
FEMALE COUNSELOR (CONT'D)
Billy. Can you open the door forHe gives her "the finger". . .Then goes back to bed!
She turns back, stares into the fog. She listens, hears only
silence. She hesitates, them decides to go and get the key.
She RUNS back toward the lake, as fast as her bare feet can
carry her. Through the trees and fog. . .finally making it
to where she left the key. She bends down, picks it up-and right by her face, two BLACK BOOTS emerge from the
mist. She looks up, sees: A MACHETE RAISED FOR THE KILL!
SLO-MOTION: As the machete rushes down, she pulls away. .
.but the blade SLICES OFF a chuck of her flowing blonde
hair, and just nicks her shoulder. . .
She runs for her life, Jason pursuing. She runs, runs, lost
in the fog. . .surrounded by the trees. She TRIPS. .
.staggers up. . .turned around. . .which way was he coming
from??
CRACK. Someone's close. She stops she slowly walks
backwards, away from the sound. . .back, back. . .eyes wide
she bumps into - a TREE. Whew. She turns to head the other
way-and JASON VOORHEES is right in front of her. With amazing
speed, his machete heads for her gut. . .

6.

REVERSE ANGLE: She actually FLIES BACK from the force of the
blow, heading for a treeBACK OF TREE: The tip of the machete's blade pierces
through.
BLOOD DRIPS from the tip of her toes. . .which we now see
are suspended a few inches off the ground. Her eyes lock
with the white hockey mask. . .Her breathing getting slower,
slower. Her life slips away.
Impaled against the tree, she slumps over, dead. Jason
reaches for his machete, but another SOUND stops him. Is
there someone else out here? He turns to his leftIn the fog, a dark shadow moves.

Someone wearing a HAT.

CLOSE ON - MOUTH - LIPS that look burned, charred,
familiar. The lips pull back to expose rotting teeth...
UNSEEN STALKER
(mockingly)
"CH-CH-CH--HA-HA-HA!"
As Jason stares into the fog, OUT OF FOCUS in the b.g., the
dead girl's head SLOWLY RISES BACK UP.
DEAD FEMALE COUNSELOR
I should have been watching them.
Not drinking. Not meeting a boy at
the lake.
Jason turns back to her - but she then changes into a
different girl. Black hair, taller. Someone completely new.
UNKNOWN DEAD GIRL
I deserved to be punished.

7.

We watch now as she turns into a YOUNG MALE. Behind Jason,
the UNSEEN STALKER is coming closer. . .
UNKNOWN DEAD BOY
We all deserved to be punished.
He changes into another girl, then someone else. . .faster
and faster. The changes become flashes, a chorus of voices
blend together. . .dozens of Jason's victims from years
past. . .
UNKNOWN VICTIMS
For what you did to you. . .for what
we did to your mother. . .
Jason pulls out his machete, and the victims dissipate into
the mist. . .turning the fog RED. And that's when FREDDY'S
CLAW reaches for Jason's shoulder. . .touching himJason spins around to attack, but no one's there. Then, out
from the fog comes...Jason's mother - PAMELA VOORHEES.
JASON'S MOTHER
Jason. My special, special boy. Do
you know what your gift is? No
matter what they do to you. . .you
can not die. You can never die.
Jason just stares at her, listening respectfully.
JASON'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
That means you don't have to stay
here. You're just...sleeping...
right now. And mommy wants you to
wake up. Because I've got something
I want you to do.
KRRRACK!! Thunder and lightning CRASH!

8.

JASON'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
There is a street that I want you to
go to. On that street, there is a
house...where you'll punish someone.
Only one. And when your task is
finished, you must return to me.
Understand? You must come straight
back to Mommy. I'll be waiting for
you, here at Crystal lake. Our
home.
(becoming fierce, scolding)
But first...you have to WAKE UP!
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - REAL WORLD - SUNSET
An old abandoned HOUSE. A mailbox in front with the name
VOORHEES hand-stenciled on the side. A near-by sign reads:
CRYSTAL LAKE - 2 miles .
CRANE UP: Over the newly paved road in front of the house.
Suddenly, we rush down...INTO the ground...down ToINT. UNDERGROUND - JASON'S UNMARKED RESTING PLACE -

SAME

KOOM! A massive body, buried in the ground, suddenly jolts.
JASON'S MOTHER (VO) (CONT'D)
Rise up, Jason! NOW! You're NOT
DEAD! You must obey me! You will
LIVE AGAIN!
The body. . .a BLACK HEART beats. We move up, see Jason's
hockey mask. His eye pops open.
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DREAM WORLD - NIGHT
Jason's gone. His mother stands among the trees, alone.
But the, everything CHANGES. The fog clears instantly.
Trees start to fade, then disappear. The lake vanishes.
We're not in Crystal Lake..this was some sort of DREAM.
PUSH IN ON: Jason's mother. An evil grin creeps across her
face as her SKIN slowly begins to melt away.

9.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Make them remember what fear tastes
like.
We keep PUSHING IN, finally holding on Freddy's evil
piercing eyes. We see fires reflected in them. The fires
of HELL.
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
I've been away from my children for
too long.
We can only HEAR the tortured souls around him, can only
IMAGINE the hellish wasteland that surrounds him...
BACK TO:
EXT. TOWN OUTSIDE CRYSTAL LAKE - SUNSET
A bulldozer rumbles down the newly paved road in front of
the VOORHEES HOUSE. Across the street, there's a Bait &
Tackle shop. In the doorway, the Old Proprietor shakes his
head.
INT. BAIT & TACKLE SHOP - SAME
Inside, a CONSTRUCTION WORKER puts a candy bar on the
counter. The Old Proprietor comes around and rings him up.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
What's the problem? Opening a resort
by the lake will bring you more
business.
OLD PROPRIETOR
Bound to bring a lot more then that.
The Old Proprietor gives him a haunted look. The
Construction Worker smiles condescendingly, and leaves.
INT. BAIT & TACKLE SHOP - NIGHT
The Old Proprietor fills a pipe, watching TV. Suddenly,
through the open door, we see a FIST break up through the
road, sending chunks of asphalt flying! A head emerges. .
The Old Proprietor turns slowly to his right, sees Jason's
hulking figure climbing out of the ground. Jason slowly
marches straight toward him and INTO THE STORE.

10.
The Old Proprietor backs up, nowhere to go. Jason looks in
the glass display counter, containing everything a fisherman
might need... including a machete in a sheath. SMASH! Jason
slowly unsheathes the machete, admiring it.
OLD PROPRIETOR
(trembling and terrified)
.will that be it for ya then??

. .

Jason raises his head up slowly. . . one eye gleaming
through his mask at the Old Proprietor. He cringes, shutting
his eyes tight. And when he opens them, Jason is gone.
The old man looks out the door to the foreboding dark trees
outside: Shadows MOVE. Leaves SWIRL. Lightning PULSES.
EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT
A pleasant street lined with middle-class suburban homes.
Thunder crashes, Rain begins to splash on the ground... as
BLACK BOOTS step into frame.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: JASON. Standing under a STREET SIGN
that reads: ELM STREET . He stalks toward one particular
unsuspecting home. On the mailbox: 1428 ELM ST.
Jason stands in the driveway as rain falls, machete in hand.
There are lights on in the windows...kids inside, The house
locks renovated, modernized. The front door no longer red,
but painted YELLOW. Its as if the house's troubled past has
been washed away and forgotten.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - SAME
POV - VIDEO CAMERA: In BLACK & WHITE, three young goodlooking female FACES stare intently at us.
KIA
I'm telling you, this thing is a
Nanny-cam. It's probably videotaping
everything we're doing right now.
LORI
Why would my Dad buy me a Nannycam??
Standing in a neatly furnished living room, Lori (17) pulls
a STUFFED TOY (like a FERBIE, but creepier) away from her
friend Kia. Lori's an attractive, trusting, girl next door.
KIA (18) is worldly, black, and the hottest of the three.

11.
KIA
Maybe he wants to make sure his
little Princess isn't naughty while
he's away for the weekend.
Watch.

LORI

Lori snaps her fingers in front of the toy.
MR. NUZZLES
Hi! My name's Mr. Nuzzles. HA-HA-HA!
LORI
See? He's Mr. Nuzzles. It's a toy.
My Dad just has bad taste, that's
all.
GIBB
That's great Lori. Is this what
we're doing all night? Cuz... FYI?
This sucks.
GIBB (17) wears a baseball cap, drinks a BEER. She looks
like a tomboy party-girl.
KIA
Well, it's the thought that counts.
My Dad and I aren't even talking,
He's such an ass. Did I tell you he
won't loan me the money for my
surgery? It's not like I won't pay
him back...
LORI
Here's a thought, Kia: maybe you
don't NEED a nose job! You know you
already look great. I mean, you get
asked out more than anyone. What's
the point?
KIA
You got something against selfimprovement?
Gibb pulls out a CIGARETTE... heads for the window.
LORI
Gibb! I thought you were gonna quit.
GIBB
I only smoke when I drink now.

12.
KIA
But you're always drinking.
GIBB
Yeah, I gotta work on that next.
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - SAME
POV FROM OUTSIDE: In the pouring rain, someone watches Gibb
sit down on the sill, and open the window wide.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - SAME
Gibb blows smoke outside the window into the blackness of
night. Thunder claps. The LIGHTS inside flicker. . .
LORI
Maybe I should get some candles?
GIBB
What we need is more beer. This is
your Dad's last one. You guys want
anything?
Gibb drains her beer, ready to go. She leans over toward the
open window, flicks her cigarette outside OUTSIDE: It hits Jason right in the mask, sparks flying.
BACK INSIDE
Gibb gets up, gets her keys, and heads for the front door...
LORI
Are you sure you should be driving?
GIBB
Please. Three beers is
kill me-

not gonna

Gibb pulls open the door and STANDING IN THE DOORWAY IS
TREY (18). She's startled. He holds up a l2pk of beer,
smirks. BLAKE (17) stands behind him.
Surprise!

TREY

GIBB
Trey. You answered my prayers.
She grabs the beer, and they kiss. But he pushes her off.

-

13.
TREY
Babe? What have I told you about
kissing me after you've smoked, huh?
GIBB
Those were menthols! I thought you'd
like it...
TREY
I brought Blake. So where's Linda?
GIBB
It's Lori. And this is her house, so
don't be a dick.
Trey pushes past her into the house. His buddy follows him
in, sipping from a SILVER FLASK. We immediately dislike
these two slicksters. Gibb closes the door. Lori pulls Kia
aside, aggravation on her face... whispersLORI
Did you know they were coming over??
KIA
Look, we knew you were just gonna
sit here alone all night. You need
to meet a guy! And... Blake's cute.
LORI
He's not my type.
KIA
Who is?! And don't say Will Rollins,
'cuz that boy moved like four years
ago.
LORI
I'm really getting sick of this
town.
I/E. 1428 ELM STREET - NIGHT
Lights flicker in the windows of Elm Street. INSIDE, music
plays, everyone hanging out. Trey and Gibb are all over each
other. Lori puts down candles. Blake turns to LoriBLAKE
I like the flow of your place. Got
good feng shui. You know about Fen
Shui?

14.
KIA
You should see her bedroom. Great
flow in there. Lori? Why don't you
go upstairs and let Blake see your
feng shui?
Lori turns to Kia with a pissed off look when - BOOM!
Lightning CRACKS nearby and the power goes out completely.
Lori strikes a match, lights candles. It's still dark
though. Trey stands abruptly, gives Gibb a knowing lookTREY
C'mon. I got a kink in my neck. You
can give me a massage. . .
GIBB
I think I need a couple more drinks
before there's gonna be any
"massaging."
TREY
Babe? Don't make me ask you twice,
OK?
Trey heads upstairs. Gibb, holding Mr. Nuzzles the toy, puts
two beers under her arm, grabs a candle and follows him.
GIBB
C'mon Mr. Nuzzles. You're gonna
wanna see this. . .
Gibb goes upstairs with a wink. Lori just shakes her head.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - DAD'S UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Trey's taking off his shirt, folding his clothes neatly on a
chair. Gibb puts Nuzzles and the candle on the nightstand,
starts pulling back the sheets on the bed. . .
TREY
Hey. What are you doing? Those
sheets are probably filthy. Just
pull back the comforter. . . we'll
just lay on top, ok?
GIBB
God you're a freak.
BACK DOWNSTAIRS
Kia, Lori and Blake sit in awkward silence. Finally-

15.
BLAKE
So Lori. Am I gonna get that grand
tour?
LORI
Why don't you start in the kitchen?
And get us a beer while you're in
there.
Blake shoots her a sexy nod, leaves. Kia turns to Lori:
KIA
Look, if you're afraid of Blake
because you're a virgin, don't be.
He's harmless. You only have to go
as far as you want.
LORI
Shut up, Kia. I just don't like him
KIA
You don't like anybody! We're almost
out of school and you've barely gone
out since your Kia was about to say something, then thought better of it.
LORI
What, Kia? Since my mom took off? My
dad needs me, okay? I can't just go
out all the time with guys. And if I
did, it wouldn't be with someone
like Blake.
KIA
(softening, this is her friend)
OK, I get it. The girl just wants to
go at her own speed. But pretty
soon, you're gonna have to ease up
on the brakes a little bit.
IN THE KITCHEN
Blake walks in with a candle. In the b.g, we notice the back
door is OPEN, a wet puddle on the floor. He opens the
fridge, grabs beers.
He closes the door AND - Whew. Nothing
behind it. Then Blake's candle is suddenly BLOWN OUT. He
notices the open door, walks toward it slowly. . .closes it.
UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

16.
Trey and Gibb are going at it, Gibb on top. Gibb turns to
see Mr. Nuzzles staring at her on the nightstand and laughs.
DOWNSTAIRS
Blake comes back in the living room with the beers.
BLAKE
Your back door was open. I closed
it.
Kia and Lori look at each other, worry on their faces...
UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
Trey and Gibb lie next to each other on the bed, the deed
now done. She leans over to cuddle, a sexy simile on her
face...
TREY
Babe? You know I don't like to be
touched after, OK?
Gibb shakes her head, can't believe this guy. She pulls up
the comforter, wraps it around herself, gets up abruptly.
GIBB
I'm takin' a shower.
TREY
Good. Your hair smells like
menthols.
Trey stretches out on the bed, satisfied. Gibbs pissed,
takes the candle into the bathroom, leaves him in
darkness...
DOWNSTAIRS
Blake, Kia and Lori with candles, checking windows, spooked.
UPSTAIRS BATHROOM
Gibb turns on the SHOWER.
move??

Did a shadow behind her just

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
Trey rolls over on his stomach, reaching for Gibb's beer on
the nightstand. Lightning flickers revealing: Jason
standing next to the bed! He slowly unsheathes his
machete... and as we MOVE DOWN... we look under the bed...

17.
THWOCK! The machete's blade erupts through the bottom of the
mattress. Blood drips from the tip of the blade to the
floor. The blade Pulls back up. Beat. ThenTHWOCK! THWOCK! THWOCK! THWOCK! THWOCK! The machete pierces
through the mattress over and over again...
BATHROOM
One toe in the tub, Gibb stops. She heard something.
Trey?

GIBB

BACK IN THE BEDROOM
Jason stands over his victim, looking at what he's done with
detached fascination. Suddenly, Trey's finger twitches.
Jason suddenly grabs both ends of the bedframe and collapses
the bed onto Trey, FOLDING IT TOGETHER. Silencing him.
BATHROOM
What was that sound?? Gibb turns off the water, listens.
It's all quiet now except for what sounds like someone
LAUGHING in the next room.......
GIBB (CONT'D)
Trey? What the hell are you doing??
Gibb moves toward the bedroom... leaving her candle...
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - DAD'S UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
It's dark in here. Gibb locates the source of the laughing it's coming from Mr. Nuzzles' voice box. She picks it up.
GIBB
Eew! You're all wet, M. Nuzzles...
CLICK! The LIGHTS suddenly COME BACK ON brightly, and Gibb
sees Mr. Nuzzles in her hands, speckled with blood. It
continues to repeat the canned laughter, stuck in a loop.
Gibb looks up toward the bed and gasps horribly. (We can
only imagine what Trey must look like.) She can't catch her
breath... walks back, backIN THE HALLWAY -and runs fight into:

LORI!

LORI
I think someone's in the house...

18.

Gibb is shaking... points to the bedroom. Blake, Lori, and
Kia look into the room... see the carnage. Kia screams...and
they tear off down the hallway...
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - NIGHT
Lori, Kia, Gibb and Blake pour out the front door of the
house, Gibb still wrapped in the bed's comforter.
DOWN THE BLOCK -- A police car turns onto the Street on a
routine patrol. Kia runs into the Street, waving her arms.
A young cop (DEPUTY STUBBS) stops, rolls down his window. He
looks at Gibb, half naked trembling, blood on her hands
DEPUTY STUBBS
You kids need some.. assistance?
GIBB
(screams, holding up her bloody
hands)
The fuck do you think?!
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - DAD'S UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Police tape over the doorway. The Sheriff's OFFICERS are all
over the bloody crime scene. The SHERIFF stands closely with
one of his more nervous looking men, speaks in hushed tones.
SHERIFF
Look at this place. And the kid was
killed in bed. Remind you of
anything?
NERVOUS OFFICER
Jesus, it's even the same damn
house. 1428 Elm. Gotta be him,
right? Gotta be Freddy Kru SHERIFF
HEY. Don't even say that
sonofabitch's name out loud. Let's
keep it together.
NERVOUS OFFICER
Someone should burn this place down.
SHERIFF
OK lets wrap this up quick and get
the hell out of-

19.
LORI
Wait. . .who's Freddy. . .?
BLAKE
Is that who did this?! FREDDY WHO?!
The Sheriff turns to see Lori and Blake standing in the
hall. They look shaken up, eyes puffy. And they've been
listening.
SHERIFF
WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING UP
HERE?! Deputy Stubbs! Get 'em out of
here, NOW!
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - NIGHT
Gibb, Kia, and Blake's parents escort them to waiting cars.
Lori sits ALONE on her doorstep.
IN THE STREET, the SHERIFF stands closely with his men.
SHERIFF'S OFFICER
Her father's on his way. Should we
take her down to the station with
us?
Beat. The Sheriff considers this gravely.
SHERIFF
We have to lock this down now. Keep
it contained. We've been through too
much to let this thing spread now.
Deputy Stubbs approaches... and hears the Sheriff say:
SHERIFF (CONT'D)
We can't take her to the station.
The girl has to wait here.
DEPUTY STUBBS
I'm sorry... you want to keep her
here?? Her friend was just murdered
in there!
The cops look to each other conspiratorially. Stubbs is the
outsider. We can see the FEAR behind the other cops' eyes...
SHERIFF
OK, Stubbs. You stay here and keep
an eye on things till her father
arrives.
(MORE)

20.

SHERIFF (Cont'd)
But make sure you stay awake out
here. Listen to me now: don't doze
off. Not on this one, you hear me?
NERVOUS OFFICER
And I'd stay away from that girl
too!
The other Officers high tail it out of there, leaving Stubbs
alone, puzzled. He looks over to Lori. . .
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - NIGHT
Lori now in her doorway, about to lock up, looks worried.
Stubbs stands on her doorsteps, doesn't like all this, butDEPUTY STUBBS
Now, we've been through the house
three times. It's completely safe.
Is there anything else that I canLori shakes her head, a distant look on her face. Beat. The
Deputy hands Lori a walkie-talkie. It belches STATIC.
DEPUTY STUBBS (CONT'D)
Take this. You get scared, you want
to talk, ANYTHING... I'll be right
outside, OK? Your Dad should be here
soon.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Lori sits on the edge of her bed in her PJs. She spies the
walkie-talkie on her dresser...
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - POLICE CAR - SAME
Deputy Stubbs relaxes behind the wheel, pours a cup of
coffee from a thermos. The walkie-talkie comes to life:
KRRRISHT! INTERCUT BETWEEN LORI AND STUBBS, LORI IN HER
WINDOW:
LORI
OK, I do have one question. The
Sheriff said a name. Freddy
something, started with a K. Like
maybe he was the suspect. I think he
has something to do with my house.
You know who that is?

21.
DEPUTY STUBBS
Tell you the truth...I don't. I
haven't lived here that long. I can
look into it for you, though. Over.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Lori in her bed, under the covers, staring at the ceiling,
her mind swirling. Wondering about what she heard. Afraid.
LORI
. . .Freddy. . .
Lori YAWNS... looking over to a PICTURE of her FATHER on the
dresser. Suddenly, the walkie-talkie BELCHES STATIC.
VOICE ON WALKIE TALKIE
(through intermittent static)
KRRRISHT... Lori... KRRRISHT...
Lori! Are you awake? Over.
KRRRISHT ...
Lori reaches over, picks up the walkie-talkie.
LORI
What? I didn't copy that... say
again...
VOICE ON WALKIE TALKIE
Don't panic, but... KRRRISHT. .
.think there's someone... KRRRISHT
the house...
Lori's eyes go wide, sits up fast.
IN THE HALLWAY
Lori walks barefoot, clutching the walkie-talkie, trying
desperately to understand, getting scared now.
LORI
I can't hear you! Please!
VOICE ON WALKIE TALKIE
KRRRISHT... GET OUT! He's coming for
you! Freddy's in the KRRRISHT,..
It's Freddy Kr-KRRRISHT ...
Lori runs toward the room where Trey was killed... shields
her eyes from seeing inside, turns the corner...

22.
LORI
Repeat! Who?! FREDDY WHO??
Krueger.

LITTLE GIRL (OS)

AIIGH! Lori screams, seeing a little GIRL in a pristine
white dress standing rigidly at the other end of the hail.
LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
His name... is Freddy Krueger. And
he loves children...
CLOSE UP -- LITTLE GIRL'S FACE - - The little girl's eyes
have been stabbed out, by Freddy's claws we're sure. Just
empty bloody black holes now. One red tear streaks down her
otherwise perfect face...
LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE
. . .Especially little girls.
LORI stumbles back in horror, grabs a door knob, turning it
frantically, trying to get away from here... IT OPENS...
BEDROOM
Lori slams the bedroom door. ON THE WALL, a blood streak
appears, painting a trail. Lori follows it with her eyes. Up
to the ceiling... it moves across the ceiling, whereTHERE'S A DEAD GIRL REACHING FOR LORI. She jumps back. The
blonde teen wears only a blue night shirt and is somehow
held to the ceiling. (Tina from "A Nightmare On Elm Street")
DEAD TEENAGE GIRL (TINA)
Freddy is coming back. It's OK to be
afraid, Lori. We were all afraid.
Warn your friends... warn all your
friends...
Lori runs downstairs, heading outside. The house starts
CHANGING - windows now boarded, walls have graffiti. And as
she goes, a familiar SONG echoes all around her:
"One, Two, Freddy's comin' for you. Three, Four, better. .
."
OUTSIDE - TWO GIRLS continue to sing Freddy's song while
playing jump rope. The house now looks like it used to.
Her front door SLAMS and turns from yellow back to BLOOD
RED.

23.

Lori spins around, sees WHITE CROSSES all over her lawn,
marking the dead. And as we PULL BACK, Lori looks down Elm
Street, and sees white crosses at every other house too.
". . . Nine, Ten, never sleep again ."
Then the SOUND of Freddy's horrible cackling. All we see is
the back of his red and green sweater as he reaches for herEXT. 1428 ELM STREET - STUBBS' POLICE CAR - NIGHT
Sipping his coffee, Stubbs glances at his rearview mirror
and sees: SOME HUGE GUY WEARING A HOCKEY MASK .
AIIGH! In the passenger seat, LORI wakes up with a SCREAM.
Deputy Stubbs spills the coffee all over himself. . .
DEPUTY STUBBS
Dammit. You OK?
Lori nods, shaken. . .face white, sweating. Stubbs checks
the rearview mirror again skeptically, and rubs his eyes.
LORI
I guess I'm no better off down here
than I was in my room.
DEPUTY STUBBS
Another nightmare? Like I said, you
stay wherever you're comfortable
till he gets here. You're safe.
Whoever did this isn't gonna hang
around here.
He takes another look through his window. No one there.
EXT. ELM STREET - BLAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
BLAKE sits in front of his house on a porch swing, wrapped
in a blanket. The front door opens, and his father comes
out.
BLAKE'S FATHER
Get inside, Blake. We have to talk.
. .
NEAR THE HOUSE. . .WALKING THROUGH THE TREES. . .
JASON marches back to whence he came as told. Then he hears-

24.
BLAKE'S FATHER (OS) (CONT'D)
You were supposed to be Watching
your sister tonight. You're going to
have to be punished.
Jason pauses to stare at him. . .through the leaves. . .
BLAKE
My best friend was just killed, Dad.
So how about giving me some FUCKING
SPACE!
Dad leaves. And as Jason stares, we PUSH IN on his eyes. . .
JASON'S MOTHER
And when your task is finished, you
must return to me. understand? You
must come straight back to Mommy. .
.
Jason starts walking again. . .but then. . .he takes a last
look back: Blake pulls out his flask, hits it hard, draining
it. (Blake should have been watching his sister AND he's
drinking. Is the temptation for Jason too much??)
BACK ON THE PORCH
BLAKE
I'm gonna get this guy, Trey. Swear
to God. I'm gonna get this Freddy
guy.
Blake drops the flask, rubs his eyes drunkenly. . .when he
suddenly hears RUSTLING coming from behind the bushes.
BLAKE (CONT'D)
Who's that? Someone there?
Oh my God. . .Blake actually gets up and heads toward the
bushes. The leaves move. . .someone definitely behind them.
BLAKE (CONT'D)
What am I doing?
Blake stops in his tracks, starts to back up when- BAAAAH!
Blake whips around to see a GOAT standing in front of the
porch, its white beard stained red with blood.
JESUS!

BLAKE (CONT'D)

25.
Laughter echoes. Blake turns to see a DARK FIGURE wearing a
hat, standing by some garbage cans across the street. He's
nothing more then a silhouette. Then, his shadow seems to
grow, almost bleeding across the street toward Blake.
Blake's had enough. He turns to run, but the blackness
reaches him, and a dark shadow claw stabs into Blake's
foot. Blake hits the ground hard and starts screaming as
the shadow claw drags Blake rapidly across the street toward
Freddy. . .
BACK ON THE PORCH
AIIGH! Blake WAKES UP, still sitting on the porch swing.
BLAKE (CONT'D)
Oh God! It was just a nightmare. I'm
OK. I'm awake. . .
Blake looks at his foot, sees a HOLE in his shoe. He moves
it, and sees a bloody mark. He looks at it, confused. Then - he looks up and sees JASON STANDING OVER HIM . Blake's
about to scream when Jason grabs him by the throat, and
wraps the porch swing's rope chain around his neck. . .
And as Blake's life sleeps away, his breaths becoming
shorter, he falls unconscious. . .and we PUSH IN on his
vacant eyes. . .
BIRD'S EYE VIEW - DREAM WORLD - STREET
Blake's body is laid out on the street, the last place he
was in the dream before he woke up. The DARK FIGURE in the
hat stands over him, prods the body with his boot.
FREDDY KRUEGER
This town ain't big enough for the
two of us, Jason. (seething) 'Cuz
Freddy don't do sloppy seconds.
Blake lets out his last breath, and his body disappears. . .
EXT/INT. - WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
The nuthouse. Patients slowly slide their soft white shoes
over clean white linoleum. Wheelchairs. Orderlies.
TWO YOUNG MEN (WILL and CARLOS) in white patient uniforms
play ping-pong together. Carlos seems to blink his eyes
alot. . .like a twitch. Will is less enthused by the game.

26.
CARLOS
You can't handle my skills, bro!
WILL
That's just 'cuz your meds give you
itchy hair-trigger reflexes.
CARLOS
Not to mention cotton-mouth and
paranoid delusions!
REPORTER ON TV
". . . tonight's murder in this
quiet suburban neighborhood of
Springwood. . ."
Will's eyes look to the TV mounted on the wall playing the
evening news. Carlos SMACKS the ball into Will's chestCARLOS

Lil' Debbie Snack Cakes and TWOHold on.

WILL
Look what house that is. .

WILL
Oh my God. . . Lori. What if she was
the one that - Oh God. Maybe we
should go toCARLOS
Go? Go where. . . Springwood?? I'd
rather stay locked up in the quiet
room.
A PATIENT starts tugging on Carlos' sleeve. He ignores him.

27.
WILL
Save your Dream Demon bullshit for
group. We could just go see if she's
OK. There and back. You can bring
your pills. . .
CARLOS
Are you joking? Will. . . four years
ago you told the cops that Lori's
Dad killed his wife. . .and your ass
ended up in here. You really wanna
see her again?
WILL
I was. . .confused. (cold,
mechanical, rote) I cared about Lori
so much. . .that when her Mom left
them, I invented a story in my head
that vilified her father Carlos tires to free his arm from the patient's tuggingCARLOS
- so you could have Lori all to
yourself. I know, I'm the one who
stole your file for you! Oedipal
Complex bullshit, blah-blah-blah!
You think these head-shrinkers have
all the answers.
WILL
I have to see if she's OK, Carlos
Carlos finally turns to the patient tugging on his sleeve.
CARLOS
YOU'RE INVADING MY SPACE, KURT!
We'll play 'Uno' in a minute! (beat,
to Will) Look at us, Will. Look
around you. We're institutionalized.
Not to mention, there's no way out
of here.
Will looks at Carlos, defeated. He knows he's right.
INT. WESTIN HILLS ASYLUM - NIGHT
Will lays on a thin cot, wide awake, staring at the ceiling.
The room is spartan, empty, cold.
CARLOS (OS)
You still thinking about her?

28.
We see Carlos is in a cot on the other side of the room.
WILL
I gotta know if she's OK.
Beat. Carlos winces. . . can't believe what he's about to
do.
CARLOS
You ever heard of Freezoid?
INT. WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Carlos holds up a COMIC BOOK in its original yellowed bag
for a burly ORDERLY sitting near the SECURED EXIT to admire.
ORDERLY
This is issue number one? The one
where Freezoid meets Dr. Cerebrum?
CARLOS
Yep. And it's a variant cover. Very
rare. Look at the spine. It's in
mint condition. Worth a grand, easy.
ORDERLY
(beat, considers it)
What you want for it?
EXT. WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Will and Carlos, running as fast as they can away from the
mental hospital. . . disappearing into the darkness of
night.
WILL
Didn't your brother give you that
comic?
CARLOS
It's OK, man. But when we get back,
I get all your desserts for a year.
. .
INT. ELM STREET - LORI'S BEDROOM - MORNING
It's morning, but Lori is still tossing and turning under
the sheets. Finally, her eyes bat open. . .and she's
startled to see: her FATHER standing over her bed. Was he
watching her?

29.

Dad!

LORI

Lori's father (DR. CAMPBELL) sits down and hugs her warmly.
DR. CAMPBELL
I carried you up here last night.
Hope you don't mind. But. . .we
don't have to stay here tonight if
you don't want to.
LORI
I'm just glad you're home. . .
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - KITCHEN - MORNING
Lori sits at the kitchen table. Dad is by the back window.
Lori looks comfortable around her father. They're close.
LORI
I know we agreed not to talk about
her. . . and don't take this the
wrong way. . .but I wish Mom were
here right now with us.
DR. CAMPBELL
I know what you mean, Princess.
Dad stares out the window at an old rusted SWING SET in the
backyard. He quickly wipes away a tear.
DR. CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
The police. Did they. . .look around
the house? They ask you questions. .
tell you anything?
His back to her, he casually pours a glass of OJ. He empties
the contents of a small capsule into the glass.
LORI
No, they wouldn't really talk to me
Dad nods, accepting this? He stirs up the OJ quickly. . .
DR. CAMPBELL
I still don't think it's a very good
idea for you to go to school. You've
just been through something very
traumatic. I wish you'd reconsider.
. .

30.
LORI
I want to go. I want to be around my
friends. Don't worry, Dad. . . I'm
OK.
Lori kisses him on the cheek and heads for the door. Dr.
Campbell's body language says he doesn't want her to leave.
. .
DR. CAMPBELL
At least have some orange juice!
LORI
I'm already late. . .
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - MORNING
Lori walks out her front door, backpack on, ready for
school. But when she closes the door, something stops her.
She turns back to her YELLOW front door. Remembers
something. Beat.
She pulls a metal NAIL FILE from her backpack. . .and after
a final moment's hesitation, she starts scraping at the
paint.
LORI
It was just a dream.
It's RED underneath, just like her dream. Lori starts
breathing heavily, afraid.
EXT. SPRINGWOOD - MORNING
Will and Carlos climb down from inside a semi-truck. . .and
wave goodbye to the driver. They're still in their uniforms.
WILL
No one else is gonna believe that
we're medical students. We gotta
change outta these clothes.
CARLOS
Relax, we're almost there. . .
EXT. CARLOS' HOUSE - MORNING
Carlos and Will creep up to the door of a suburban home,
looking sketchy. Carlos knocks, straightens his shirt. . .
Now. . .

CARLOS

31.

CARLOS (Cont'd)
My parents are kinda fucked up. I
mean, one son in the looney bin. .
.other committed suicide. . . you
can understand.
WILL
Completely. Don't worry. I'll be
cool.
The DOOR OPENS and Mom is standing there in a bathrobe,
holding a glass of OJ. Face blank.
CARLOS
Mama? It's me. This is Will, myThe glass falls from her hand. . .and SMASHES on the floor.
She moves to him awkwardly. . .eyes wide. . . and HUGS
Carlos tightly. Tears run down her cheek. Carlos softens. .
.
INT. CARLOS' HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - SAME
Carlos pulls clothes out from a dresser, hands some to Will.
CARLOS
These should fit you.
Will looks around for somewhere to change, heads toward the
BATHROOM down the hall. . .
Will puts his hand on the knob, starts to open it when. . .
SLAM! Carlos rushes over and pulls it shut in front of him.
CARLOS (CONT'D)
Sorry, bro. We, uh. . .don't use
that bathroom anymore.
The fear on Carlos' face is unmistakable. It dawns on Will.
WILL
Sorry, man. I wasn't thinking. . .
They move away from the bathroom door back to Carlos' room.
And as Carlos shuts his bedroom door, he steals another
haunted glance at the bathroom. . .then shuts his door
tight.
EXT. SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

32.
Lori walks up the steps toward school, sees KIA and GIBB
sitting together on a stone ledge, waiting for her.
LORI
I wasn't sure you were gonna come
GibbGIBB
What was I gonna do? Stay home and
go mental in my room?
Gibb looks awful. Kia sees students STARING at them. . .
KIA
I guess everyone saw it on the news.
They all know. This is so messed up.
INT. SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
It's even worse inside. WHISPERS start about Gibb and Trey.
Kia and Lori try to hold everyone back as best they can,
thenGIBB
STOP STARING AT ME!
BRRRIIING! Bell rings, and students hustle into classrooms.
EXT./INT. SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Now dressed normally, Will and Carlos slip inside the
school. They sneak down the empty hall. Will looks nervous.
CARLOS
If she isn't here, we should check
the morgue next.
WILL
You're a real goddamn optimist,
Carlos.
CARLOS
Hard to be an optimist when you're a
manic depressive.
BRRRIIING! End of class bell rings and students flood into
the hallways. Carlos and Will immediately get split up. . .
AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL, LORI exists class with a nerdy
looking guy (LINDERMAN) following her closely, KIA behind.

33.
LINDERMAN
-well I was thinking, that maybe you
and I could partner up on our
Physics projectLORI
I can't really think about that nowKIA
Jesus, Linderman! Don't you know
what she's been through?? Leave us
alone!
LINDERMAN
I'm sorry. . . I didn't-- I'm sorry.
. .
LORI
It's OK. I'll talk to you later.
Linderman slinks off, eyes flickering to Lori. He's smitten.
KIA
It's like, nice timing to hit on
you, you know? Every day with this
dork it's the same thing.
LORI
Take it easy on him. He didn't know.
As Kia and Lori push their way through the herd of students
they approach GIBB talking with two stoner types (FREEBURG &
SCOTT) passing out YELLOW FLIERS to students as they pass. .
.
FREEBURG
That's why you should go Gibb. Be
among friends where it's safe.
There's gonna be alotta love there.
. . for you and Trey.
GIBB
You know? Fuck it. You're right. I
could use a few dozen drinks.
SCOTT
Atta girl. Let your freak flag fly.
NEARBY - CARLOS makes his way through the students, gets in
front of a large JOCK. Eyes twitching, Carlos looks strange.

34.
CARLOS
Do you know if Lori Campbell is
alive?
SHACK
(looking him up and down) Uh. . . .
. . .yeah. That's her over there-He points to LORI, standing with Kia and Gibb as they
examine one of the fliers. Carlos makes his way toward them.
. .
GIBB
You guys have to come with me to
this rave tonight. . .
LORI
I don't know if I'm up for it. I
didn't tell you this but, the cops
were talking about suspects, and I
overheard a name. (beat, this is
difficult) Then I had. . .a really
bad dream. . .about this guy. It was
so awful.
GIBB
So they have a lead. That's good.
KIA
I can't believe those cops made you
sleep there. I'd have nightmares
too.
LORI
But this was different. He was so
real.
GIBB
So what'd he look like?
LORI
Well. . .he wore this dirty brown
hat. . .
OTHER END OF HALLWAY - Will's looking in open classrooms.
CARLOS is almost upon Lori, within earshot when-LORI (CONT'D)
And his skin. . .was horribly
burned.
Carlos suddenly stops, her words stabbing him like a knife.

35.
LORI (CONT'D)
On his right hand, he had these long
razors. . .like they were his
fingers.
Carlos starts walking toward Lori slowly. . .like a dream.
LORI (CONT'D)
And there was this song. . .
CARLOS
"One, Two, Freddy's comin' for you.
. .Three, Four, better lock your
door. . ."
Lori goes rigid, turns to see Carlos behind her. He looks
crazy, shaking. Kids around them stop and stare, LISTENING.
CARLOS (CONT'D)
You had a dream about Freddy
Krueger. . .
KIA
Hey, freak! Who the hell do you-LORI
How. . .how do you know about him?
And that song. . .that was from my
dream.
CARLOS
You know why they sing that??
Because that's when he comes for
you. While you sleep! You're lucky
to be alive. . .
LORI
Who is he? Please. . . tell me.
CARLOS
(overzealous)
A child murderer that some parents
from around here burned alive. But
then. . .he came back. Back for
revenge in our nightmares. Funny no
one ever told us about him, huh??
NEARBY - Will sees Lori and his face fills with emotion. But
she's talking to Carlos, looking afraid. Will rushes overON LORI and CARLOS - Lori looks uneasy on her feet, head
swimming. . .terrified. Kids look to one another, scared.

36.
LORI
He's real?? What. . .How do youCARLOS
You want some free advice? Coffee:
Make friends with it.
WILL gets to them, and pulls Carlos away from Lori. She
turns to Will, looks at him strangely. Does she know him??
WILL
I'm sorry Lori. . . don't listen to
him. He's. . .not well.
LORI
Who. . .who are-WILL
It's me, Lori. Will. I was watching
the news and - . . .Lori, are you
OK?
LORI
Will. . .?
Her eyes roll back, and she hits the ground. Students gather
around her. . . words spreading among them like wildfire.
WHISPERING VOICES
. . .she passed out. . .they know
who killed Trey. . .name is Freddy
Krueger. . .child murderer. . . said
he comes in our nightmares. .
.Blake's dead too. . .
INT. SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
Will and Carlos wait outside the infirmary, in the hall.
WILL
What were you thinking, man?
CARLOS
I'm thinking for the first time in
my life that maybe I'm not crazy.
She had the same dream. My brother
was right.
WILL
Just stop pushing your paranoid
fantasies, OK? We're not in group
anymore. That Boogeyman isn't real,
and that old story's bullshit.

37.

WILL (Cont'd)
It's like Dr. Sims said . . .it's
Dream Anxiety.
CARLOS
Not real, huh? Tell that to Lori.
Carlos opens a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE labeled HYPNOCIL: FOR THE
SUPPRESSION OF DREAMS and dry swallows a pill.
INT. INFIRMARY - EXAMINING ROOM - SAME
Lori is laying asleep in an infirmary bed, a frosted GLASS
WINDOW behind her. Something RED and GREEN rises up outside.
INT. INFIRMARY - WAITING ROOM - SAME
Outside the examining room, Kia and Gibb sit and wait. Kia
is leafing through a MAGAZINE. She looks over to Gibb who
seems to be nodding off. Kia looks to a NURSE behind a desk.
KIA
How much longer? Is she OK or what?
The Nurse slowly puts a finger to her lops: "shhhhhh." Kia
furrows her brow, goes back to her magazine.
INSERT - MAGAZINE PICTURES of perfect looking models.
Kia looks back to the nurse. . .
KIA (CONT'D)
For a nose-job, what kind of
anesthesia do doctors use? They put
you all the way under, right?
The Nurse slowly points to a sign on the wall that reads:
"THE NURSE CAN'T HELP YOU." That's weird. Kia returns to her
magazine. And as she flips the pages, the pictures of the
models became more and more bizarre. . .
INSERT - MAGAZINE PICTURES of semi-nude women with magic
marker lines on their faces and bodies depicting where
surgical incisions will be made. Realistic before and after
nose-job shots, complete with bruised eyes and bloodied
noses. Then strange and archaic-looking surgical tools. .
.bits of bone and flesh in metal receptacles. Scars. And
now. . .a hellish collage of vivisected women. . .
Kia flipping the pages, faster and faster. Panicking.
Suddenly, an image stops her: long rusty blades. . .CLAWS.

38.
SNICKT! A red and green striped arm SHOOTS OUT of the
magazine, blades connecting with Kia's nose and face!
FREDDY KRUEGER
GOT YOUR NOSE!
INT. SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - INFIRMARY - DAY
AIIGH! Kia WAKES UP, the magazine open on her lap. She
quickly tosses it to the floor as if it were a snake. She
looks to her right, sees Gibb staring at her. Scared.
GIBB
Hey. Do you. . . believe . . .anything
that guy Carlos was saying?
Beat. Kia shakes her head: No. Gibb gets up nodding,
stretches, heads for the door. But then, a tiny trickle of
blood runs from Kia's noes. Kia touches it. . . looks in
horror at her fingers. Then she rubs it away. . .hiding it.
INT. SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
Will and Carlos sitting on the ground now, in the hallway.
WILL
I can't wait here anymore. I'm going
in.
PRINCIPAL SHAYE (OS)
Who are you? You aren't students
here! What are you don't on school
property?
The PRINCIPAL approaches as GIBB comes out of the infirmary.
WILL
Hey! You're a friend of Lori! I need
to see her. . .the Nurse wouldn't
let mePRINCIPAL SHAYE
Let's go you two, right now.
The Principle shuffles them down the hall, PUSHING them.
Will turns to Gibb, his eyes pleading with her. . .
WILL
Please. . .I can't go to her house.
Her dad and I, we. . .it's
complicated.
GIBB is unsure what to do. . .but then shouts to him. . .

39.
GIBB
The yellow fliers. I'll make sure
she's there.
Will grabs a discarded flier off the floor, and he and
Carlos take off toward the exit, the Principal following
them out.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - SAME
Will and Carlos walk down the school's steps . . .
WILL
Strong work. I came to make sure
she's OK, and you put her in the
infirmary.
CARLOS
Come on. I wanna go check something
out.
INT. LIBRARY - SPRINGWOOD - AFTERNOON
A gothic, cavernous library, nearly empty. Green legal lamps
decorate long tables. Carlos and Will are at a computer. . .
CARLOS
This doesn't make any sense. There's
nothing on Krueger. Not his arrest,
death. . .not even a birth
certificate.
WILL
There you go. Common nightmares are
a group delusion brought on by mass
hysCARLOS
Maybe they didn't up the stuff on
computer yet.
Carlos and WILL make their way through the stacks. . .Now
they're huddled at an old-school MICRO-FICHE machine. . .
CARLOS (CONT'D)
Wait a second. Look at this.
Large sections of what they are looking at are BLACKED OUT.
All that's left are partial headlines. . . pictures. . .

40.
CARLOS (CONT'D)
There's whole sections of records
gone. Look at all these blacked out
obituaries.
WILL
So what? Springwood's library sucks.
Carlos gets up like a man possessed, heads to PERIODICALS.
He's flipping through the original NEWSPAPERS. Pages are
missing. . .sections are cut out. This is creepy.
CARLOS
January 18. The day my brother
committed suicide. Why isn't that in
here?
WILL
I don't know. But I'm sure there's a
good reason. Remember in morning
session? They used to tell us not to
jump to conclusions beforeCARLOS
(grabs Will be his shirt) Jesus,
listen to yourself! You hold onto
that psychobabble like a security
blanket! Let it go man! (beat,
releases him) They covered him up,
Will. They never told us about him,
because that's how they decided to
beat him. And it worked.
WILL
But what. . .I guess now you think
something brought him back?
Beat. Carlos eyes look hollow. He nods slowly. . .
EXT. SPRINGWOOD - SUNSET
The sun sets on the town of Springwood.
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - NIGHT
Gibb driving behind the wheel, Kia has shotgun, Lori in
back.
LORI
What am I supposed to say to him?
God, I can't believe I fainted. . .

41.
KIA
Don't worry about it. Just talk to
him.
GIBB
Just say: "Welcome back, you're the
only guy I've ever loved. . .you
wanna do it"?
LORI
Uh. . .feeling better, Gibb?
GIBB
Yeah. I'm officially in re-tox.
Gibb brings a BEER up from between her legs, guzzles it. Kia
looks bad to Lori and they share a worried look. . .
EXT. CARLOS' HOUSE - NIGHT
Will and Carlos stand in the driveway to his house. . .
WILL
Even if all that you're saying is
true, then why didn't this guy kill
Lori?
CARLOS
Freddy might be using her for
something. Or maybe he's not strong
enough yet. My brother said it's our
fear that gives him his power.
WILL
Well you sure as hell spread enough
fear today at school . . .
Beat. Carlos' face goes white as it dawns on him. . .
CARLOS
Holy shit, you're right. They wanted
to forget Freddy so they wouldn't
fear him. What if I screwed up the
town's plan?? (beat, in panic now)
Oh God! This fucker's gonna spread
like a disease. Kids are gonna start
falling asleep. . .and. . . and. .
.it's gonna be a bloodbath! Let's
leave, man. Right now.
Will tries not to look at Carlos like he's crazy.

42.
WILL
I can't just leave her again. . .not
after today. I just. . .wanna talk
to her, you know? I gotta see her,
one more time.
CARLOS
This guy's real, Will. If you fall
asleep. . .you won't wake up.
WILL
So you comin' with me, or not?
CARLOS
No way. Lori's been marked. And if
you're smart, you'll at least take
one of my pills. You won't dream
that way. . .
WILL
I'm sorry Carlos, but I just don't
believe any of this. You and me. .
.we're both. . .sick. (beat,
serious) I won't take too long. Then
it's back to the nuthouse. . .for
both of us.
Will takes a set of KEYS from Carlos' hand. Carlos nods,
hits the garage clicker. Inside, there's a tricked out 70's
van. Will admires the PICTURE air brushed on the side:
CLOSE ON - A well-endowed fantasy chick with armor and axe,
taking on a serpent. Like art from Heavy Metal magazine.
WILL (CONT'D)
Your brother musta been one of a
kind.
He was.

CARLOS

WILL
So lemme guess: the serpent is a
huge dick and she's trying to tame
it?
CARLOS
Will, Will, Will. Sometimes a
serpent, is just a serpent.
Will tries to smile, gets in the van, starts it up. He pulls
back down the driveway. Carlos suddenly looks concerned.

43.
CARLOS (CONT'D)
Hey wait a minute! Do you even know
how to drive??
The Van hops over a curb, and screeches down the road. . .
EXT./INT GIBB'S CAR - NIGHT
They drive down a dark road. To their right, nothing but a
dense CORNFIELD. Lori stares into the cornstalks as they
rush by, mesmerized by the repetition. . . unease on her
face.
LORI
Why are they having it out here in
the middle of nowhere?
GIBB
(turning around to face Lori) Uh. .
. that's the point, Lori. So the
cops won't bust it up.
When Gibb turns back to the wheel, there's someone standing
in the middle of the road! Is that JASON??
OH SHIT!

GIBB (CONT'D)

She yanks the wheel to the right, barely missing him. In the
RED LIGHT of the brake lights, we see a solitary flash of a
hockey mask just before it disappears into the darkness.
GIBB (CONT'D)
There was someone in the road!
KIA
Christ Gibb, you're drunk. I can't
believe I let you drive.
They turn at a SCARECROW popping up from the cornfield. .
.and into a narrow path where the corn has been cut. The car
goes deep into the corn, no light except from their
headlights.
They finally come upon CARS blocking the path. They get out.
EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT
Kia, Gibb and Lori walk toward pounding music, but there's
nothing ahead except dense cornstalks, until. . .

44.
. . .they walk into a large circular, carded-out clearing in
the corn. Here, deep in the cornfield, is where the rave is
happening. At least, a small-town version of a rave.
Tiki torches outline the perimeter, kids dance in the center
in front of a DJ at the turntable. Not too huge, maybe fifty
kids total. . . but pretty damn cool nonetheless.
A huge GRAIN SILO looms in the distance. . .
LORI
Wow. . . Isn't some farmer gonna be
mad?
GIBB
Shack's uncle owns it. Long as the
football team keeps winning, he
doesn't give a shit.
Nearby, we see SHACK with his teammates, all wearing
jerseys, all drinking beer from a BEER BONG, chanting: Go!
Go! Go!
A small generator runs the flashing light and sound system.
Kids are decked out in the latest gear, many with
glowsticks. Three KEGS off to one side, a small CAMPFIRE on
the other.
GIBB immediately grab a cup of beer from some guy's hand,
and blends into the dancing mob, leaving Lori and Kia.
KIA
Guess her mourning period's over.
LORI
It's her way of not dealing.
KIA
Well. . . God bless her then. What's
a little partying gonna hurt?
OUTSIDE THE RAVE
In the cornfield near the silo, an old rusted out corn
picker is surrounded by weeds. A HAND comes INTO FRAME and
yanks off one of the machine's long cutting rods. KRANK!
POV: Jason stalking toward the glowing rave in the distance.
BACK AT THE RAVE
A sweaty GLOWING RAVER ambles up to Kia, lust in his eyes. .
.

45.
GLOWING RAVER
You want a light show?
The RAVER immediately goes into a ridiculous dance all
around Kia, twisting his arms, using the many glowing items
on his hands and arms, to try and heighten the trippy
effect.
KIA
OK, move along, glow-worm.
The Raver leaves. Kia and Lori walk into the crowd. . .
ENTRANCE TO THE RAVE
A small two-wheeled RED SCOOTER sputters in. Its rider takes
off an oversized helmet, revealing: LINDERMAN. He surveys
the party, nodding. He says to himself. . .
LINDERMAN
What's that Lori? You want me to
bring the funk? OK, but just for you
my sweet.
Linderman starts doing the old ROBOTO DANCE. SHACK and the
other JOCKS behind him start laughing their asses off.
SHACK
GO Linderman! Go Linderman GO -Linderman freezes, embarrassed. . . tries to slink away
when-SHACK (CONT'D)
Hey! C'mere, buddy! I got something
just for you.
LINDERMAN
Actually Shack, I was headed over
to-But Shack pulls him in by the keg, and forces his lips
around the tube of a full beer bong. Linderman tries to
fight-LIFT!

SHACK

Jocks lift the beer bong, and beer GUSHES around Linderman's
face. They all laugh as Linderman pulls away from them.
LINDERMAN
Great. . . thanks guys. . . really.

46.
TRIPPY DUDE
Freeburg! Whassup! I've been looking
for you, dog. I need the magic.
FREEBURG
I can bestow what you seek. . .
Freeburg nods knowingly, does a little cheap "magic" and
pulls a small WHITE PILL out of the guy's ear. Ecstasy.
NEAR THE KEG
Lori's alone. Linderman sees his opportunity, makes a move.
LINDERMAN
Hey, Lori. Didn't think I'd see you
here. Can' I get you something to
drink?
Just then, KIA shows up with beers. . .hands one to Lori.
KIA
Smooth opening, but we're taken care
of.
LORI
What happened to your clothes?
LINDERMAN
Oh this? Me and the jocko's were
playing a drinking game. But, it
seems I was penalized for my ability
to read above a fourth grade level.
KIA
And I thought you wet yourself
again.
LINDERMAN
You know, Kia? I used to think you
hated me because you thought I
wasn't good enough for Lori. But
that's not it. You try and tear me
down to make yourself feel better.
It's not me you hate. You hate
yourself. It's sad, really. . .
With that, Linderman leaves Kia speechless. Lori can only
look down. Kia notices something by the ENTRANCE. She taps
Lori, and she looks. They see: WILL walking into the rave.
LORI
Shit. What do I do? Go over there?

47.

KIA
Go wait by the fire, but don't look
like you're waiting. I'll do the
rest. . .
ENTRANCE TO THE RAVE
Will walks around wide-eyed. They didn't have anything like
this at the institution. He's clearly out of place here. . .
KIA (OS) (CONT'D)
Hey. . . you look a little lost.
Will turns, sees Kia with a hint of recognition on his face.
WILL
No. . . I'm just, uh. . . looking
for-KIA
- Lori? I know. C'mon. You want a
beer?
She hands him a cup. As they walk through the crowd, Will
takes a sip, and his face grimaces. Was that his first beer?
BY THE CAMPFIRE
Kia, and will finally break through the throng to the
campfire. And there, he spots her, sitting by the fire. Lori
and Will lock eyes. And she smiles. So does Will. In the
b.g. we see Linderman watching. . . heart breaking.
EDGE OF DANCING MOB
Gibb leaves the dancing area. . . sweaty, stumbling, drunk.
She goes over to the line by THE KEG to get another beer.
GIRL IN BEER LINE
The cops are saying Blake killed
Trey then went home and committed
suicided.
GUY IN BEER LINE
How do you hang yourself on a porch
swing? It's such bullshit.
GUY IN BEER LINE #2
I'm telling you, I heard this guy
Krueger killed 'em both.
(MORE)

48.

GUY IN BEER LINE #2
(Cont'd)
I said his name to my parents. . .
they almost lost it.
The GUY suddenly looks over, notices GIBB staring at him.
Upset, she drops her cup, bolts the other way. AS SHE RUNS,
it seems as if EVERYONE is whispering about FREDDY. . .
BY THE CAMPFIRE
Will and Lori are sitting together by the fire. Not too
close. Still awkward. Will often looks away from her. . .
WILL
I'm really sorry for my friend
saying all that stuff to you. He's.
. .uh, he's got issues. Are you
feeling. . .better?
LORI
Still a little freaked out. The
things he said. It's just such an
insane coincidence. How do you know
him?
WILL
Uh. . .we're sorta like. . .
roommates. At school. I actually
have to head back soon. But. . .I
don't wanna go. . .if you're not OK.
LORI
I don't know. It's like. . .I'm
afraid to close my eyes, you know?
Do you definitely have to. . . leave
again? I mean, so soon?
Beat. Will looks off, distant. Emotion on his face.
WILL
You know what I think about a lot?
That I never got to say goodbye to
you. Before I. . .left.
They lock eyes. . . but Will has to look away, HIDING
SOMETHING. Lori moves closer, ever so slightly . . .
LORI
Really? You. . .think about me?

49.
WILL
Sometimes all the time.
Lori looks at the fire, working up her courage?
LORI
I can't believe I'm admitting this
to you, but. . .you're actually. .
.the only guy I've ever kissed. Oh
God - you probably think I'm this
total sheltered loser now.
WILL
Believe me, I'm the last person who
would think that.
Will's suddenly very uncomfortable, the truth starting to
come out. He sees GIBB stumbling by the edge of the corn.
WILL (CONT'D)
(changing the subject)
Isn't that your friend? Is she OK?
LORI
Not really. She's trying to hide it,
but I know how messed up she is
about Trey.
POV: THROUGH THE CORN - Jason moves right to the edge. . .
BY THE EDGE OF THE CORNFIELD
Gibb walks alone, swaying drunkenly. She watches the
dancing crowed in the distance. There's a rustling behind
her. . .
Gibb turns around and sees. . . TREY's FACE emerge from the
cornstalks! His skin is pale. His eyes are yellow.
TREY
I'm dead one day, and you're already
out getting shitfaced. Same old
Gibb.
GIBB
Trey! I. . .I can't believe it. . .
TREY
C'mon. . .let's go.
Beat. Gibb is frozen where she stands. His eyes narrow-

50.
TREY (CONT'D)
Babe? Don't make me ask you twice,
OK?
Trey disappears into the corn. And Gibb follows.
INT. CORN - NIGHT
Gibb follows Trey in the darkness. We can't see Trey that
well, but he's walking strangely, hunched over. And for some
reason, he keeps touching his face and chin. . .
GIBB
You're walking funny. What's wrong?
They break free of the corn and are now in a large clearing
in front of the SILO. And now we can see Trey clearlyTREY
The hell do you think's wrong? Don't
you remember what happened to me?
He's mangled. He touches his face again and now we see why:
He's trying to keep his head upright, but his neck's broken.
TREY (CONT'D)
C'mon, quit screwin' around. I wanna
show you something.
His head slumps over again as he hobbles to the RED SILO
DOOR, and walks in. Gibb follows, a sick look on her face.
INT. GRAIN SILO - SAME
STEAM SHOOTS in Gibb's face, water drips from pipes
overhead. Strange for a grain silo. Looks more like a BOILER
ROOM. . .
GIBB
Trey? Where are you??
Trey's nowhere in sight. Suddenly, a hissing echoey voice. .
.
VOICE (OS)
. . .This way. . .
GIBB
I don't like this. I'm gonna go
back.
Gibb turns, but the door is gone. Freddy' laugh echoes.

51.
BACK AT THE RAVE - WAKING WORLD
The GLOWING RAVER is scopeing out the women. Approaches one.
GLOWING RAVER
Hey honeydew. You down for a light
show?
RAVER CHICK
You down for some pepperspray?
The glowing Raver holds up his hands, leaves the dance area.
He walks off, sees someone on the ground in the far
distance.
It's GIBB, lying on the ground, surrounded by empty beer
cups, passed out ASLEEP. The Raver approaches her. . .stares
at her beautiful legs. He gets a lustful look in his eyes.
He looks around nervously, like checking for witnesses. . .
BACK IN THE BOILER ROOM - DREAM WORLD
SCREEECH! The sound of knives on metal pipes. Gibb is moving
faster now. . .trying to get away from that sound.
Walls and pipes stretch, like Freddy's crawling inside them.
This place is alive. . .and elastic. Laughter echoes.
GIBB
You're the one that killed Trey!
A SHADOW on the wall behind her. . .that distinctive hat.
FREDDY KRUEGER (OS)
Forget about my Errand Boy.
She tries to make her way through the boiler room, but it's
like a maze. An obscured flash of Freddy at every corner.
FREDDY KRUEGER (OS) (CONT'D)
The only thing you have to fear. . .
Freddy's face appears in the reddish light. . .out of
nowhere. . .right near her. Scarier than he's ever been.
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
. . .is fear HIMSELF!
Gibb SCREAMS and Freddy drinks it in, pure pleasure on his
face. This is what he's been waiting for. She RUNS. . .
BACK AT THE RAVE - WAKING WORLD

52.
The GLOWING RAVER is lying next to Gibb's sleeping body. He
looks around once more. Her body twitches from what's going
on in the Boiler Room. It excites the Raver. He kisses her.
IN THE BOILER ROOM - DREAM WORLD
Gibb runs down a catwalk, passing a series of LOCKERS. As
quietly as she can, she opens one and slips inside. . .
POV INSIDE LOCKER - Breathing heavily, Gibb can just make
out what's happening through three slits in the metal
locker's door. Suddenly, she holds her breath, and Freddy
passes. . .Beat. She exhales. She puts her face to the
slits, looks left and right. No one there. She moves to
exit, whenFREDDY suddenly appears, upsidedown, face filling the slits!
He turns clockwise slowly, facing her right side up. . .
CRANK! Freddy rips the door off, reels back for the kill
when blood spurts on Freddy's face. His eyes go wideGibb looks down at her own stomach, and there's a wound! She
coughs up blood. . .and starts DISAPPEARING.
NOOO!

FREDDY KRUEGER

BACK AT THE RAVE - WAKING WORLD
JASON has just stabbed the GLOWING RAVER in the back with
the metal rod. . .while he was laying on top of Gibb! The
rod went all the way through, stabbing them both. Gibb's
dead.
Jason pulls out his rod, but the Glowing Raver is still
stuck on it. . .and ALIVE. Jason shakes it, but he won't
fall off. With a sudden burst of strength, Jason flings the
Raver back over his shoulder so hard that it LAUNCHES the
kid off the rod like a catapult!
We watch the glowing kid fly through the blackness of the
night. . .like a shooting star that glows. . .finally
disappearing into the cornfield.
EDGE OF THE CORN
The CROWD is bouncing up and down, dancing in colorful
bliss. Away from the crowd, near the edge of the corn, two
BIG DUDES hang out by the TIKI TORCH, drinking.
BIG DUDE #1
This everclear is kicking my ass.

53.
They see Jason emerge from the corn, heading right at them.
. .
BIG DUDE #2
Check out this fucking guy.
BIG DUDE #1
Must be some drunk farmhand. C'mon.
The Two Dudes walk up to Jason. Jason stops.
BIG DUDE #1 (CONT'D)
HEY! Jethro! This is a rave, not a
Halloween party.
BIG DUDE #2
Invite only, cornpoke.
Big Dude #2 walks IN FRONT of his friend, and starts POKING
Jason in the chest as he speaks. . .
BIG DUDE #2 (CONT'D)
(poking on each word)
And you. . .weren't invited.
TILT DOWN: Jason slowly steps a big black boot on the Dude's
bare left foot - CRUNCH!
AIIGH!

BIG DUDE #2 (CONT'D)

Jason then steps his other boot down the guy's right foot,
pinning him to the ground. Jason suddenly grabs his headREVERSE ANGLE: Big Dude #1 watches in horror as -CRACK-Jason
twists the guy's head around 180 until the two Dudes are
left FACING each other! Jason then POKES the Dude in the
chest. . . and he falls over, dead.
BIG DUDE #1
Sonofa-BITCH!
The guy tosses his drink in Jason's face, dousing him with
EVERCLEAR. He pulls up the TIKI TORCH and JABS IT at Jason,
who instantly goes up in flames.
BIG DUDE #1 (CONT'D)
YEAHH! Burn motherfucker!
But Jason seems unfazed. Even as he cooks, he calmly removes
the MACHETE from his sheath. . .and marches toward the guy.
The Big Dude's eyes go wide, and he runs for his life. . .

54.
IN THE CORNFIELD
Jason just marches after the Big Dude as always. . .even as
he burns. The Big Dude runs this way and that. . .stumbling
tripping. . .it's like a maze in here.
BIRD'S EYE VIEW FROM ABOVE: As the guy weaves, Jason heads
straight for him, leaving a long FIRE TRAIL behind him.
JASON has almost caught up, WHIPS his machete. . .and the
blade hurls through the air on fire!
THWOCK! It buries in the guy's back and he falls. The fire
spreads all over his back. . .and onto the dried cornstalks.
. .
AT THE KEG
SHACK is getting ready to take down yet another full beer
bong. He's uneasy on his feet, trashed, eyes narrow.
JASON bursts through the corn, STILL ON FIRE. Ravers that
see him scream and run. But Shack is focused on that beer.
As Jason marches up to Shack from behind, the TRIPPY DUDE
with the big dumb hat watches, clearly blazing on X.
TRIPPY DUDE
DUDE! Burning man!
Shack stares at the Trippy Dude, doesn't get it.
SHACK
Hey, you're my witness. This is
three and a half beers in one shot.
That's the record. OK. SPRINGWOOD
BULLDOGS RULE!
Shack puts the tube to his lips, the FLAMING JASON right
behind him now, people screaming all around them. As Shack
lifts the funnel. . .Jason opens his arms wide, and smashes
Shack's head in with both hands, CRUSHING his skull. . .
FOOF! The BEER in the tube BLOWS OUT the top of the funnel
straight up from the force, comes back down, and lands with
a splash on Jason. . .PUTTING OUT THE FIRE.
The Trippy Dude can't believe his eyes. That was amazing!
TRIPPY DUDE
BRAUGHH! DUDE! OH MAAAAN!
Jason turns to him, pulls out his machete. . .

55.
POV - TRIPPY DUDE ON X - So many colors, all blooming and
trailing off the machete's blade as it descends upon us.
TRIPPY DUDE (OS) (CONT'D)
This feels so real. . .
NORMAL VIEW: Trippy Dude's dead, a stupid smile on his face.
JASON stalks into the center of the rave, and now EVERYONE
sees him. RAVERS SCREAM and scatter in all directions.
WILL, LORI, and KIA run with the crowd, see the maniac in
the hockey mask. They cut toward the van. . .but Lori trips
on Gibb's DEAD BODY. She falls to her knees. . .sobbingLORI
GIBB! OH GOD, NO!
Kia grabs her arm, drags her up. They run for CARLOS' VAN.
RAVERS scatter, start their cars, mow down corn as they go.
Will, Lori, and Kia pile in the van's OPEN DOOR. . .
WILL
Get in! HURRY!
Nearby, LINDERMAN jumps on his scooter. . .KICKS for it to
start. WHIRR. Nothing.
LINDERMAN
C'mon baby. . .c'mon. . .
WHIRR-WHIRR! Still nothing. Linderman looks back, sees:
Jason heading right for him! Linderman kicks harder, faster.
LINDERMAN (CONT'D)
Oh God please. . .this isn't how the
Linderman story is supposed to end!
WHIRR-WHIRR-WHIRR! This thing ain't starting. FREEBURG runs
toward Carlos' fan as its door slams. He bangs on itFREEBURG
HEY DUDE! LEMME IN - C'MON!
The door opens and Freeburg dives in. Will starts the van as
LORI looks out, sees Jason almost on Linderman.
LORI
LINDERMAN! This way!
But he's in his own world, trying to start it. . .

56.
LINDERMAN
. . .Start start start start start.
. .
WHIRR-WHIRR. . .VROOM! It starts. Linderman guns it, but the
scooter just kicks up dirt, NOT MOVING. What the hell??
Linderman looks over his shoulder, sees Jason's holding the
back of the scooter! Jason arcs back with his machete. . .
LINDERMAN (CONT'D)
I regret nothing.
Linderman shuts his eyes and -WHAM! The back of the van
slams into Jason, knocking him to the ground. Freeburg
scrambles out of the van and pulls Linderman inside. . .
Jason gets up, but the van is already gone. He's left
standing alone in the carnage, the field ablaze behind him.
INT. CARLOS' VAN - NIGHT
Everyone shell-shocked under the funky BLACK LIGHTS of the
van. Will driving, Lori crying quietly, Kia eyes wide. . .
KIA
Was that him?? The guy you were
talking about? Freddy Krueger??
LORI
That wasn't the guy from my dream.
That was someone else. . .
LINDERMAN
Who cares about some Dream Guy?!
That psycho in the hockey mask was
REAL!
Freeburg puts a JOINT in his mouth, tries to spark it. .
.hand shaking, terrified. He whispers to himselfFREEBURG
Dude. That Goalie was pissed about
something. . .
Linderman's hyperventilating. In his backpack, he dumps out
his lunch from a brown bag, and starts breathing into it. .
.
WILL
We gotta go talk to Carlos.

57.
LINDERMAN
Talk to who?? How about the police?!
Please. . .just drop me off...OK?
They all nod to one another, can't take this. . .
INT. CARLOS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Carlos sits at his desk, going through the drawers. He pulls
out a framed black and white photo: A happy kid (CARLOS)
rides on the shoulder's of a young man (CARLOS' BROTHER).
CARLOS
I always believed you, bro. Neither
of us were crazy.
CLOSE ON - His brother (MIGUEL) in the picture. He winks.
Carlos shakes his head - what the hell? He checks his
pocket, pulls out his bottle of pills quickly, pops off the
top, shakes it into his palm. But it's empty.
Shit.

CARLOS (CONT'D)

ZWIP! A high angle IMAGE appears on his computer screen. It
looks like a live feed from his own bathroom. A young naked
male walks in (we only see him from behind) and turns on the
bathtub. He leaves. . .then returns with a STRAIGHT RAZOR.
Panicked, Carlos pulls the plug to the computer, and the
image winks out. But then Carlos realizes. . .
. . .HE CAN STILL HEAR WATER RUNNING! He looks down his
short hallway, sees STEAM coming out from under his bathroom
door.
Almost against his own will, Carlos rises from his chair,
walks slowly down the hall toward the door. . .
INT. CARLOS' HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Carlos throws open the bathroom door, and: It's empty. No
water in the tub, no steam, no Miguel. He breathes easier.
CARLOS
I've gotta stay awake. . .
Carlos rummages in the medicine cabinet. . .shoving stuff
off the shelves, can't find anything. He slams the cabinet
shut-

58.
-and sees a flash of FREDDY KRUEGER IN THE MIRROR
Carlos whips around, looks behind him...but nothing's there.
Whew. But then...he feels something under his bare feet.
He's standing in a small puddle of blood. He follows the
blood to its source...and sees MIGUEL LYING IN THE TUB.
Blood drips from his slit wrists onto the white tile...
CARLOS (CONT'D)
OH GOD! I'm dreaming...I'm
dreaming...
Miguel's eyes suddenly OPEN. And Carlos screams.
MIGUEL
I thought this was my only way to
escape him. But it doesn't have to
end like this for you, bro. . .
Carlos turns to run, but his bare feet seem stuck to the
floor. Blood tendrils grow into his feet, rooting him there.
MIGUEL (CONT'D)
There's someone who's getting in
Freddy's way. His name is Jason.
CARLOS
This isn't real. I've gotta wake up.
MIGUEL
Freddy wants you to get rid of him.
CARLOS
SOMEBODY PLEASE WAKE ME UP!!
MIGUEL
Didn't Mom teach you not to talk
with your mouth full?
Carlos suddenly looks nauseous. He gags once. . .
CLOSE ON - CARLOS' MOUTH. A single solitary MAGGOT squirms
out the corner of his mouth. Carlos then doubles over,
heaving and gaging. He vomits up about a pound of writhing
maggots, all over himself and the floor.
MIGUEL (CONT'D)
He can make it so much worse if you
want.
EXT. CARLOS' HOUSE - DRIVEWAY / INT. CARLOS' VAN - NIGHT
Will pulls up in Carlo's van. He turns to Lori.

59.
WILL
I'll go sneak Carlos out. Wait here.
WILL EXITS. Lori looks in the back. Everyone's been dropped
off except Freeburg. He's clearly out of his mind, munching
Linderman's lunch. He offers her a bite. She gets out. . .
EXT, CARLOS' HOUSE - NIGHT
Will creeps around the side of the house, looks into Carlos
window. Carlos is sitting in front of his computer, head
down, asleep on his desk. Will taps lightly on the window...
Carlos...

WILL

Lori approaches. He isn't waking. She starts to get nervousBACK IN THE BATHROOM - DREAM WORLD
Carlos tries to control his breathing...Still doubled over.
Miguel looks angrier now, SITS UP in the tub...
MIGUEL
Freddy would do the job himself but
that sonofabitch just won't sleep!
Miguel's bare arms and legs start to bubble and burn...smoke
rising from his skin from an unseen source of heat...
CARLOS
You're not my brother. I know who
you are. You're not Miguel...You
want me to get rid of this guy Jason
because if they're afraid of him and
not you...you'll lose your power.
Miguel reaches over and grabs Carlos by the hair. Miguel's
bare arm now scarring, burning...bloody and pus filled.
MIGUEL
Freddy OWNS you...He owns ALL of
you! You're HIS children, not
Jason's!
Carlos stares back at Miguel with rage and determination...
CARLOS
I'm not gonna do this shit for you,
Freddy. Not now, not ever. So do
your worst you demented, extra
crispy bastard-son-of-a-hundred-whogives-a-shit!

60.
Miguel has now turned into FREDDY KRUEGER in the flesh.
FREDDY KRUEGER
OK Chico. I just hope you can still
look yourself in the mirror tomorrow
morning.
Beat. Still holding him by the hair on his head, Freddy
lunges and drives Carlos' FACE into the medicine cabinetEXT. CARLOS' HOUSE - NIGHT
BAM! Carlos FLIES BACK out of his chair, like he was hit by
an invisible truck! Will and Lori watch through the window
as his body crashes to the floor...
Will and Lori desperately try to pull open the window,
watching Carlos as he crawls out of viewWILL
CARLOS! CAAARRR-LOOS!
BAM! Carlos' HAND slaps against the glass. Carlos' battered
face follows, eyes pleading to Will for help. Will picks up
a ROCK, about to break the glass, whenFOUR PARALLEL CUTS slash down Carlos' throat and chest.
WHAM! He's again slammed by an unseen force, and he flies to
the center of the room. He lands on the ground in a heap.
Will drops the rock. It's over. Will and Lori move away from
the window.
Carlos' MOM rushes into the room, cradles her son's
twitching body off the floor, and screams with everything
she's got.
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET / INT. CARLOS' VAN - NIGHT
Carlos' van sits in Lori's driveway. Will staring down. Lori
in shotgun, blank stare. Freeburg's gone. Beat. No one says
anything for awhile. They just...shake.
WILL
(in shock, coming apart)When you've
been through something horrible, you
can get...mixed up...as to what's
real. Sometimes...you can't even
trust what you see. Maybe...that's
what's happening.

61.
LORI
(trying to stay together) It
happened. He was asleep, but
something was cutting him. FOUR
CUTS! Will! Like from a
claw...Freddy's claw. He's as real
as that masked psychopath. (staring
into the abyss) Two different
killers. We're not safe asleep or
awake.
Will's world is crumbling. Everything he believed...gone?
WILL
I'm just -I think I'm really
startin' to lose my grip here, so
just bear with m. --Have you
see...or spoken to your mother
...since she left?
LORI
What does that have to do with this?
WILL
It doesn't. It's just that...I
thought I saw something one night,
four years ago. But then . . .some
people...helped me realize...I
didn't really see it. But now...I'm
starting toLORI
Four years ago? That's when you
moved. What...did you think you saw?
Beat. Conflict on Will's face. Should he say it?
WILL
...Your Dad kill your Mom...
KNOCK-KNOCK on the glass! LORI's FATHER in the window! Lori
and Will both jump. He waves for them to come out...
IN THE DRIVEWAY
They get out of the van, Lori's Dad waiting.
DR. CAMPBELL
Lori. You're home late. Who's this?
He's-

LORI

62.

-a friend

WILL

DR. CAMPBELL
I know who you are, Will. Why don't
you go inside, Lori? I need to talk
to Will alone for a moment.
Beat. Lori hesitates, worry on her face. Getting upset.
LORI
Dad...Gibb's dead. Something
horrible is happening around here. .
.
DR. CAMPBELL
I SAID GET INSIDE! Please.
Lori's eyes start to well up, and she runs into her house.
Will and Dr. Campbell face to face. Staring each other down.
DR. CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
I got a call from Dr. Sims today.
She's very upset. She'll be happy to
find out where you are. . .
WILL
Is that a threat, Dr. Campbell?
DR. CAMPBELL
Not at all, Will. I'm just trying to
look out for you. And protect my
daughter. She means a lot to me.
WILL
I did see you, didn't I? I wasn't
crazy.
DR. CAMPBELL
You're a troubled boy, Will.
FLASHBACK
A YOUNGER WILL stands in front of a YOUNGER DR. CAMPBELL.
Men in WHITE SUITS stand rigidly behind Will.
DR. CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
You're a troubled boy, Will.
One of the men injects Will in the arm with a syringe...as
Dr. Campbell rubs Will's head lovingly.
BACK TO SCENE - Will's face contorts as he remembers...

63.
WILL
You were there...weren't you? When I
was committed. You were in on it.
DR. CAMPBELL
Let's go inside. I can help youDr. Campbell reaches out for Will's arm...and Will pulls
back. Will hurries into the van...terror on his face...
DR. CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Stay away from her, Will. Do we
understand each other?
Will starts it up and stomps on the gas...squealing away.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
INTERCUT BETWEEN LORI AND DAD OUTSIDE HER BEDROOM DOOR: Lori
sits on the edge of her bed, crying. Lori's Dad stands
outside her door. He tries the knob quietly. It's locked.
DR. CAMPBELL
Lori? Let me in, sweetheart. I need
to talk to you about something...
LORI
What did you talk to Will about??
Lori's father pulls a pill out of his jacket pocket...
DR. CAMPBELL
I'm sorry about Gibb. Let me at
least give you something to help you
sleep...
Lori's eyes go wide. She suddenly looks very scared.
LORI
I wanna talk to Mom. You said she
moved out West. I wanna know where.
DR. CAMPBELL
You can't believe everything Will
tells you. Did you know he's been in
a mental institution for the last
four years? Did he tell you that?
Beat. Lori takes this in, can't believe it...or can she?
GO AWAY!

LORI

64.
He winces, nodding to himself. This isn't working.
DR. CAMPBELL
We'll talk in the morning. OK,
honey? Things always look better in
the morning.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
It's late. Lori in her PJs now, watching TV, eating INSTANT
COFFEE with a spoon. She watching a horror film, afraidINSERT - ON TV - The horror classic "THE FLY" from 1958 with
Vincent Price is on. We're right at the end. The fly with
the human head is caught on the web, the SPIDER getting
closer. Then the fly's infamous, high pitched shriek:
"HELP ME...PLEASE! HELP ME!" Vincent Price picks up a ROCK,
about to mercifully squash them both whenCLICK. Lori turns it off quickly, can't take it. She
shivers. Just then, the phone rings, rings, she answers it...hello?

LORI

WILL
Lori, it's Will. About your Dad. Did
heCLICK! Then, the phone goes dead.
BASEMENT
A KNIFE has just cut through the main phone line. PULL BACK
TO REVEAL: We see who's holding it: Lori's Father!
BACK IN LORI'S BEDROOM
Lori throws the dead phone across the room and it knocks
over the framed PICTURE of her Dad. She picks it up, about
to put it back...when she notices something in the picture.
CLOSE ON PICTURE - Attached to Dad's belt: A ring of KEYS.
An idea strikes Lori. She narrows her eyes, determined...and
starts eating the coffee more vigorously.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - DOWNSTAIRS - ALMOST DAWN
Lori's Dad is ASLEEP on the sofa. Behind him, Lori quietly
comes downstairs...

65.
She spots an empty pill bottle in his hand. Label says:
HYPNOCIL: FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF DREAMS. Lori reaches over
to his belt, carefully removes his KEYS.
BASEMENT
Lori walks down the dark stairs carefully into her basement.
She hits the switch for the LIGHT...but it's not working.
CLICK! Lori clicks on a flashlight and continues down. The
light bounces off a worktable...an old trunk...the infamous
furnace. It's scary as all hell down here. Lori shines her
light on an old ARMY FOOTLOCKER.
Lori opens the lock with Dad's keys...trying not to make too
much noise. She's twitchy...overcaffeinated.
INSIDE THE LOCKER: Lori finds love letters, pictures of her
MOM and Dad. Buried at the bottom is something wrapped in
cloth. After a final moments hesitation, she opens itINSIDE: a Woman's RINGS, GLASSES, GOLD WATCH. These clearly
belong to her mother. But what are they doing here??
LORI
Mom would never leave these
behind...
She quickly wraps them up again, puts the bundle away. But
right before she closes the locker, she sees a PLASTIC ID.
It's a SECURITY BADGE. With her father's picture on it.
LORI (CONT'D)
"The Katja Institute for the Study
of Sleep Disorders"?
MR. NUZZLES
Hi! My name is Mr. Nuzzles! Ha-HaHa!
YIKES! Lori jumps, shines her flashlight on: MR. NUZZLES,
speckled with blood, on a workbench. "Wait a minute..."
She picks it up, shaking it next to her ear. She looks into
its eyes. Suddenly, she feels something on its underside: a
ZIPPER. She unzips it...revealing a CAM-CORDER inside.
She shakes her head: They were right. It is a Nanny-cam.
INT. 1428 ELM STREET - LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Lori takes the TINY VIDEO TAPE out of Mr. Nuzzles' back,
puts it into the Camcorder next to her TV, and hits play.

66.
A B&W IMAGE appears on the TV of Gibb, Lori and Kia sitting
on the couch. She hits fast forward. The images blur
by...ending with Gibb leaving the upstairs bedroom.
NORMAL SPEED on the tape now. Trey is reaching for the
nightstand. Someone next to him raises a machete...she hits
PAUSE": It's clearly Jason Voorhees, the man in the mask.
LORI
It wasn't Freddy. But everyone
thought it was...
Lori looks off, the wheels in her head starting to turn...
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - BACKYARD - DAWN
Wrapped in a blanket, Lori sits idly on the old rusted swing
set in her backyard. It's early...barely first light,
everything blue. We can see her breath.
In her hands, we see she's holding her father's SECURITY
BADGE to the Dream Institute.
In the b.g., Will is climbing over the fence...
WILL (OS)
You want a push? (she doesn't
answer) I've been out here all
night...trying to figure out what to
do. I was gonna climb up to your
window...like I used to. But you
guys got rid of that rose trellis.
(beat, no answer still) Your Dad
asleep?
LORI
Were you in a mental institution?
Beat. Lori finally looks up at him...and he nods.
WILL
My parents made me go. I didn't
think I belonged there. Not at
first. Then they died my first year
inside. Car accident. Things
got...confusing, after that. But
Eventually...Westin Hills just
became my home. Now, I'm starting to
understand...I should have never
been sent there in the first place.
LORI
Tell me what you think you saw.

67.
WILL
I know what I saw. I saw him bury
her.
SUDDEN FLASHBACK
LORI'S BACKYARD - POV VIA HOLE IN FENCE - In the soft dirt
under the SWING SET, Lori's father unceremoniously dumps a
woman wrapped in a bloody sheet into a hole, and starts
filling it. Tossing dirt onto her lifeless open eyes, into
her gaping mouth.
Dad suddenly LOOKS OVER AT US as thunder and lightening
crash, and the POV quickly moves away from the hole in the
fence.
BACK TO SCENE
Lori sitting on the very same swing set, staring at her
feet.
LORI
Were? Where did he put her?
Right under your feet.
Close by.

WILL

A tear runs down Lori's cheek. She forces it away. Resolve
washes over her face. She can't let this consume her.
LORI
Let's get the hell out of here. I
don't wanna be near him another
minute.
WILL
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
LORI
I found something. We need to get
everyone together.
EXT. SPRINGWOOD - VARIOUS - DAY
THE CORNFIELD. Deserted. Discarded equipment from the rave
strewn about. Empty cars. Police tape.
CARLOS' HOUSE. His mom is crying quietly in the driveway,
police cars pulling away. His Dad has a thousand yard stare.
SHERIFF'S STATION. It's a mad house, outside and in.

68.
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY
The Sheriff stares at a B&W photo from one of last night's
murders. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: photos scattered all over.
He sits down, drops his head into his hands, overwhelmed.
Deputy Stubbs enters, tries to get his attention. He KNOCKS.
DEPUTY STUBBS
Sheriff? I've been compiling info on
possible suspects, based on
eyewitness reports of the man in the
hockey mask? Now I thin what we're
dealing with isSHERIFF
We already know who did this.
We do?

DEPUTY STUBBS

Just then, one of the SHERIFF'S OFFICERS sticks his head inSHERIFF'S OFFICER
Sheriff? We closed down the school,
set a 6pm curfew for anyone under
18.
SHERIFF
Good. Now I need 24 hour roadblocks
set up. Nobody leaves town, and
nobody gets in. We gotta contain
this sonofabitch before he spreads
any further.
The Officer nods, leaves quickly. Deputy Stubbs is confused.
DEPUTY STUBBS
Shouldn't we get the FBI toSHERIFF
No outsiders. We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.
DEPUTY STUBBS
I'm lost here. Stopped who before?
SHERIFF
We don't say his name aloud anymore.
You're not from around here, son. I
don't expect you to understand.

69.
DEPUTY STUBBS
(incredulous, exasperated) With all
due respect Sheriff, I think we have
a copycat of the old Jason Voorhees
Crystal Lake killer on our hands. I
had the files sent to me. Now there
have been reports of Voorhees
copycat killings as far away as
Manhattan...
The Sheriff gets up from his chair and into Stubbs' faceSHERIFF
We do things around here a certain
way for a reason...and that's given
us four years of peace. So you
either do what you're told with your
mouth shut, or God help me I will
lock you up, understand? (beat,
yells to the door) George! Get in
here!
One of the Sheriff's Officers pokes his head inside the
doorSHERIFF (CONT'D)
That other kid from the Institution
is still on the loose somewhere.
Pick him up. And round up all the
Hypnocil you can, we'll start
distributing it tonight. Sideeffects or not, it's all we've got.
Deputy Stubbs just stands there, lost in all this.
SHERIFF (CONT'D)
Somethin' else Stubbs? No? Then why
don't you get out there and do your
job.
EXT. SPRINGWOOD - VARIOUS - SUNSET
The town looks absolutely deserted. Storefronts are
abandoned, streets are empty. The curfew is in effect. A
POLICE CAR rolls by. After it passes, SCOTT bolts to a
houseINT. FREEBURG'S BASEMENT - SAME
Scott climbs in the window to Freeburg's dingy basement, a
real stony hideaway. They all look tired and irritable:
Will, Lori, Kia, Freeburg and Linderman's at the COMPUTER.

70.
WILL
All I know is, Carlos said he
thought there was something that
brought Freddy back...and that it
was our fear that gave him his
power.
LORI
So maybe it was Jason who helped
bring him back by killing Trey.
Freddy knew they'd think it was him.
Then we spread the fear for him from
there...
KIA
Who cares! We've been at this all
day! Why don't we all just leave
town?
LORI
Even if we leave, Freddy can still
get to us. We all know about him,
we're all afraid of him. We're
marked.
KIA
So all we have to do is not be
afraid?
FREEBURG
(trembling, afraid) Screw that clown
with the Christmas sweater! What
kinda pussy comes after you in your
dreams anyway?? No that dude in the
mask? Evil fuckin' force of nature,
man. Tell'n you.
Linderman spins, giving them a view of the computer
screen...
LINDERMAN
His name...is Jason Voorhees. He
supposedly drowned at Camp Crystal
Lake in 1957 when he was eleven. The
camp counselors weren't watching
him. Then they made the mistake of
killing his mother. Legend has it
Jason returned from his watery grave
to punish those that would dare
return to the camp. I found this web
site--

71.
WILL
"Fridaythe13th.com"? What's that
date have to do with him?
LINDERMAN
I think that's when Jason was born,
or died...how the hell should I
know? If Freeburg could find some
papers that aren't for rolling, I'll
print it up.
Lori rubs here eyes, clearly exhausted.
LORI
So Jason died by water. Freddy by
fire. How can we use that?
LINDERMAN
Jason's nothing to be afraid of. We
should focus on trying to kill him
first.
LORI
But...I thought we decided that
Freddy's probably the one pulling
the strings. Maybe we should try and
stop him first.
KIA
Then we should offer Freddy a
sacrifice.
LORI
Sacrifice? What do youA virgin.

FREEBURG

SCOTT
Someone pure. Yeah.
LINDERMAN
Well don't look at me. Even if you
pay for it, it still counts.
KIA
We all know who the virgin is here.
I always tried to hook her up with
guys butLORI
(eyes go wide, looking for help)
Will...say something!

72.
Will looks like he's considering all this gravely. Kia
drapes one arm around Will seductively ...whispers to him...
KIA
C'mon, Will. Do you really want
someone who doesn't know how to
fuck? She's just a little girl. Not
a woman...like me.
WILL
I never thought of it that way...
LORI
Is that all you care about, Will? Is
that the real reason you came back??
WILL
Because of you, I lost four years of
my life. I could never love you...
(beat, to everyone) Tie her up.
Lori gets up, staggers backward as everyone moves toward
her. Linderman pulls a SACK from behind his back...Kia has
some ROPE. Suddenly, someone puts an arm around Lori's
shoulders.
DR. CAMPBELL
Don't worry, angel. You've still got
me.
Dad smiles, face speckled in blood. But Lori doesn't scream.
LORI
Why did you do it, Daddy? Why did
you kill Mom?
DR. CAMPBELL
Who you gonna believe? Him or me?
Lori stares at her bloody father, backs away. They all close
in on her, there's nowhere to run...she BACKS INTO THE WALLBut its not a wall. It's a spiderweb. And now, she's stuck.
And we're somewhere completely new. A dark place. The
spiderweb stretches to infinity. Lori is but a speck...a
fly. Suddenly, the web TREMBLES. Something's coming.
Out from the darkness, Freddy crawls toward her on all
fours. His limbs longer, joints bending insect-like. She
tries to scream. All that comes out is a familiar, highpitched wail:

73.
LORI
(the voice from "The Fly" 1958)
"HELP ME...PLEASE. HELP ME!"
Freddy stops inches from her...Lori's terrified face
reflected in his EIGHT EYES. He opens his mouth wide...
DR. CAMPBELL
Don't worry, Princess. I won't let
him get you.
Lori sees her FATHER, next to the web, fifty feet tall,
about to crush her with a rock! (Just link in the movie.)
She screams, fighting Freddy off as he starts to bite down
on herINT. FREEBURG'S BASEMENT - SAME
SPLASH! Lori wakes with a start, water thrown in her face.
Everyone surrounds her, eyes locked on her with fear...
WILL
Are you alright?? You fell asleep!
Heart pounding, Lori looks down at her closed fists. She
opens them slowly. In one: a tooth. The other: an ear.
LORI
I pulled these out of my dream...
SCOTT
Out of your dream?? How is that
possible??
Suddenly the items turn to MAGGOTS in her hands. She jumps,
tossing them in the air with a shriek. Everyone jumps back
screaming, stomping them on the floor. Linderman backing upLINDERMAN
Oh God, Oh Jesus...We're done. I had
a future too. I had it all planned
out. Wesleyan was my safety school.
Wesleyan!!
KIA
Nobody wants to hear your hissy fit
geek!
LORI
OKAY! ENOUGH of this bullshit! We've
gotta pull together and DO SOMETHING
or we're ALL DEAD, understand??

74.
Beat. Lori's shivering, everyone silent, knows she's
serious. Lori is starting to take over this group.
LINDERMAN
We've gotta stay awake somehow.
WILL
Or stop dreaming. Carlos was trying
to get me to take one of his pills I
think they made him stop dreaming.
It was called...hypno-something.
LORI
Hypnocil? My Dad had some of that.
And I got a real good idea where we
can get some more...for all of us.
Lori holds up her Dad's SECURITY BADGE to the Dream Clinic!
EXT. KATJA DREAM CLINIC - SUNSET
Carlos' van pulls across the street from the 'Katja
Institute for the Study of Sleep Disorders.' Two guys in
white lab coats...escorted by police...lock the back door,
and leave.
EXT. KATJA DREAM CLINIC - NIGHT
Will puts a crowbar between the door and the frame...trying
to pop it off the hinges...really exerting himself.
LINDERMAN
Lori? Can I see that ID?
Lori hands him the badge. Linderman inspects it, then swipes
it at a nearby KEYPAD. The door opens electronically. Will
moves back, staring at his crowbar. Linderman turns to Kia:
LINDERMAN (CONT'D)
Mind over muscle.
POV FROM TREES - behind the clinic: Someone watches them go
inside. "CH-CH-CH-HA-HA-HA." We move toward the door.
INT. KATJA DREAM CLINIC - NIGHT
Will, Lori, Kia, Linderman, Freeburg and his buddy Scott
creep through the darkened hallway. Lori whispersLORI
It'll take too long if we all look
for the pills together. Two groups
maybe.

75.
Freeburg is shaking with fear. Lori walks off, Linderman and
Kia follow her. Will and the rest of them go the other way.
LONG HALLWAY
Lori, Kia and Linderman walk by a shadowy cafeteria. They
keep walking, eyes wide. KA-KAM! A loud noise...
LINDERMAN
What was that??
Lori shakes her head, doesn't know. They press on.
AT THE ENTRANCE
The back door to the Dream Clinic is broken at the hinges...
ANOTHER LONG HALLWAY
Will pushes open a door. Nothing but monitoring equipment in
here. He moves on. Freeburg pulls Scott back...
FREEBURG
I can't take this, dude. I'm
tweakin'. I need a little nerve
tonic.
Freeburg shows Scott a JOINT.
SCOTT
I'm feelin' that. But maybe we
shouldn't split from theScott looks out the door, into the hallway, but Will is
gone.
FREEBURG
Hurry, dude. We'll catch up...
LONG HALLWAY
Will walks down the hall, turns to his right, as if to say
something to Freeburg and Scott- but they're not there.
Great.

WILL

Will turns around as JASON CROSSES THE HALLWAY BEHIND HIM.
HALLWAY
Lori, Kia, and Linderman walk by a DOOR labeled C-17. Lori
looks at her Dad's ID Badge. It says C-17 at the top.

76.
PATIENT ROOM
PSSHT! The electronic door slides open smoothly and Lori,
Kia and Linderman walk into the dark room slowly.
LORI
Find the lights.
Linderman feels the wall, HITS a button, and- SISSSH! A BODY
ON A SLAB slides out of the wall, like in a morgue.
KIA
Put it back, Linderman!
He pushes another button, trying to make the body slide
back. Dozens of other BODIES ON SLABS come out, lining both
walls.
LORI
God...what are all these?
LINDERMAN
(looking at a chat on one slab)
Looks like...people that OD'd on
Hypnocil.
Lori focuses on one of the bodies laying there, eyes covered
with PATCHES. Her hand reaches toward his face...
LORI
Are they...dead?
KUGH! The guy sucks in a breath. Lori JUMPS back, but then
the body is again calm. Linderman reads his chart.
LINDERMAN
They're in a coma. This one was
transferred from Westin Hills
Psychiatric. He cut off his own
eyelids so he wouldn't fall asleep.
LORI
People need to dream. The same thing
would have happened to Carlos...
KIA
Lori - look at this. Your Dad's
signature is at the bottom.
Lori pauses as she walks along the row, then heads for the
exit. Linderman and Kia follow. WE MOVE OVER to the other
side of the room, through the plate glass window, and into-

77.
MONITORING ROOM
In the adjacent room, Freeburg and Scott are sitting on the
floor, passing a joint back and forth. Scott gets up, starts
playing with dials on the CONTROL PANEL.
Freeburg's in and out, eyes opening and closing, pupils just
pinholes. Freeburg sleepily turns his head left and sees:
A fat CATERPILLAR in the doorway, colored dark RED and
GREEN. It's a foot long and hideous, with an almost human
face. It rears up and blows smoke in Freeburg's face.
SCOTT (OS)
What do you think all these machines
do? Mind control or what?
Behind Scott, we see Freeburg staring at NOTHING in the
doorway, but he's inhaling deeply. Scott doesn't notice
Freeburg get up with his EYES CLOSED, and walk out the door.
HALLWAY - DREAM WORLD
Freeburg walks into the hall, sees the tail end of the red
and green CATERPILLAR inching around the corner. He follows.
PATIENT ROOM - DREAM WORLD
Freeburg walks into the patient room. The coma patients line
the room, laying flat on their slabs.
FREEBURG
What do you want?
The bodies are now all sitting up, staring at Freeburg! HOLY
SHIT! All of them start WHISPERING. We can't hear what...
FREEBURG (CONT'D)
I don't know where the Hypnocil is.
Now all the coma victims are pointing to the same spot along
the far wall. One patient with bloody patches over his eyes
is RIGHT NEXT TO FREEBURG, blue lips whispering in his
ear...
Freeburg finds the BOX OF HYPNOCIL hidden under the lab
sink. He removes one bottle, stares at the label.
FREEBURG (CONT'D)
I can't pour these down the drain.
These are what we're looking for.

78.
BEHIND HIM, OUT OF FOCUS, the red and green Caterpillar is
crawling up the wall, toward the ceiling...
FREEBURG (CONT'D)
I've gotta get back and tell them.
Drip-drip. Two drops of clear fluid land on Freeburg's
forehead. He looks up, mouth agape, to see:
The Caterpillar, stuck to the ceiling, a long string of
insect saliva dripping from it's mouth. It FALLS...
...and lands on Freeburg's face. He struggles to get it off
as the Caterpillar burrows its way down his throat! Freeburg
falls to the ground, convulsing, trying to breathe-Beat. Freeburg stands up, his body language changing
completely. Freddy is inside, controlling him.
Freeburg lurches forward to the pills, picks them up
awkwardly. We can almost make out Freeburg's muffled cries
from somewhere deep inside his own body...crying in protestFREDDY/FREEBURG
(Freeburg's voice, but raspier)
Relax, kid. Freddy's driving.
He wastes no time dumping all the Hypnocil down the sink...
INT. KATJA DREAM CLINIC - SAME
Lori and Kia are headed away from the Patient Room whenLORI
Wait...you hear that?
KIA
Sounds like...running water?
They turn around, heading back the direction they came from.
IN THE MONITORING ROOM
Scott looks up from the panel, and out the window into the
Patient Room. He sees all the bodies lying on slabs, and now
Freeburg at a running sink, pouring pills down a drain.
Hey...

SCOTT

In the glass, we can barely make out the reflection of
someone coming in the room...

79.
SCOTT (CONT'D)
What the hell is heRACK FOCUS - Reflected in the glass: JASON IS BEHIND HIM.
Scott spins, and Jason swings down hard with his machete.
Scott evades...and Jason drives the blade into the machine.
BZBZBBZBZ! Sparks fly as currents of electricity rip through
Jason. Scott steps back, stunned...can't believe his eyes.
SCOTT (CONT'D)
...holy shiWith one hand, Jason rips a cable out of the wall and whips
it at Scott's neck. It wraps around Scott's neck two, three
times. Jason and Scott are now both shaking uncontrollably,
FRYING. Facing each other, sparks flying between them...
IN THE PATIENT ROOM
Lori and Kia walk into the Patient Room and see...nothing
except EMPTY PILL BOTTLES on the counter. Kia picks one up.
KIA
Shit! They're all empty. Looks
like...someone dumped 'em.
LORI
I don't think we're alone. C'monThey exit. On the other side of the room, we see BLUE AND
WHITE FLASHES in the monitoring room's glass...
BACK IN THE MONITORING ROOM
KOOM! The machine finally overloads with one final burst of
sparks, and the current stops. The few lights that were on
in the clinic now cut off, the power shot. A few scant red
emergency BACKUP LIGHTS the only source of illumination now.
Scoot collapses to the ground, his skin black and charred.
Jason looks unaffected, removes his machete from the
machine, burning red from the heat, and heads for the door.
IN THE HALLWAY
Running under read lights, Lori, Kia and Linderman run into
Will, almost giving us and each other a heart-attack.
KIA
The pills are gone. We're out of
here.

80.
LORI
Where's Scott and Freeburg?
Will shakes his head, breathing hard...
AT THE DRUG CABINET
Freddy/Freeburg pulls out a drawer labeled "TRANQUILIZERS."
Suddenly, his right arm starts to shake, like Freddy's
losing control of it. But then, a RIPPLING WAVE of red and
green goes down the arm, and it's again under Freddy's
control.
FREDDY/FREEBURG
(Hums the children's nursery rhyme:
"Go To Sleep")
He fills up TWO JUMBO SYRINGES with a pink liquid labeled:
CONCENTRATE: Dilute 1000/1. A MANUAL lies next to it...
IN THE HALLWAY
Will, Lori, Kia and Linderman turn a corner to find: Jason,
smoldering slightly...moving out of the monitoring room, not
twenty feet away from them, machete red hot...
WILL
Go back! GO BACK!
They turn, run back the way they came. And as they round the
corner, they see FREEBURG standing in the middle of the
hall! They stop. Freeburg looks strange, eyes glazed...
LORI
Freeburg...?
Jason rounds the corner behind them. They're stuck between
Jason and Freddy/Freeburg. They run toward Freeburg...
CLOSE ON - Behind Freeburg's back - he hides the TWO
SYRINGES!
They run at him. Freeburg waits, smiling. But when they get
to Freeburg...he lets them pass. Jason heads right for him.
KIA
Freeburg! C'mon! He'll kill you!
Freddy/Freeburg doesn't move. He stands like a willing
sacrifice to Jason. They yell and scream for him to run...
WILL
The hell is he doing??

81.

I don't-

LORI

Jason arcs back his red hot machete, about to devastate
Freddy/Freeburg, when he suddenly springs to life!
FREDDY/FREEBURG
COME TO FREDDY!
They watch as Freeburg buries the two giant syringes into
Jason's NECK, pushing down the plungers, INJECTING HIM.
Jason swings his machete...
WHOOSH! Obscured in the darkness, we see two halves of
Freeburg's body spin and hit the ground.
Jason just stands there, completely still, the injection
coursing through his veins. Everyone else frozen, terrified.
Jason suddenly FALLS STRAIGHT BACK, landing flat on his
back.
Fuck ME!

LINDERMAN

INT. BOILER ROOM - DREAM WORLD - SAME
Jason sits up quickly, and finds himself someplace very
different than anything he's used to. A Boiler Room. Beat.
WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)
I'm very disappointed in you Jason.
You disobeyed your mother.
Jason stands, looks around for the source of the voice. At
the other end of the long passageway, JASON'S MOTHER steps
out of the shadows. She looks upset.
JASON'S MOTHER
But I blame myself. I should have
known you wouldn't be able to stop
killing. You're like a big stupid
dog that can't stop eating...even
when your Master's said you've had
enough.
Jason's Mother scowls...starts walking toward Jason.
JASON'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
(voice getting deeper)But now...it's
time to put this dog to sleep...FOR
GOOD!

82.
She starts running at Jason, rage on her face. Jason just
stands there, confused. That is, until Jason's Mother starts
to change into Freddy as she runs. His claws form from her
hand, and scrape against the metal pipes, causing sparks...
Jason immediately starts marching toward the speeding
Freddy, raises his machete, scraping the blade along the
metal catwalk above them, showering down sparks...
FREDDY JUMPS like he was sprung off a trampoline, arms and
legs raised...POUNCING. About to land on Jason when...
...Jason takes a swing with his machete, cutting off
Freddy's arm at the shoulder as he flies by! Freddy falls to
the ground, screaming in pain, holding onto his bloody
stump...
FREDDY KRUEGER
AARRGH! MY ARM!
But then, Freddy's face goes still. He smiles. And a new arm
grows back in its place. He does the old jerk-off motion
with his fist, i.e.:"big deal."
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
You're in my world now, bitch.
Freddy suddenly FLOATS straight up, hovering three feet off
the ground! Jason runs at him, but Freddy waves his claw and
Jason's smacked by an unseen force. He flies back, SMASHING
against the wall, pinned off the ground, then collapses.
But then, Jason gets up. Freddy seems amused. He increases
the punishment, Jason really taking a beating.
Freddy can appear anywhere, do anything. It's gravitydefying ass kicking, and it's spectacular.
But Jason continues to get up each time. Freddy's no longer
amused. His face says it all: WHY WON'T YOU DIE??
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
(light bulb goes off) You're not
afraid. (excited, pissed) Yet!
Suddenly, Jason starts to SINK. We see that the floor
beneath his feet is like QUICKSAND. He's being sucked down.
INT. DEPTHS OF DREAM WORLD - SAME

83.
Jason's BOOTS emerge from the "ceiling" of this new
chamber...being PULLED DOWN now by organic machines made of
cartilage and bone. Jason is now restrained by the hellish
machine. Cackling echoes, and Freddy emerges from the dark.
INT. KATJA DREAM CLINIC - NIGHT
Will, Lori, Kia and Linderman stand in the hallway in shock.
WILL
We can go to Westin Hills. They'll
have Hypnocil. I can get us in.
Lori just stares at Jason's body still in the hallway.
LORI
We're not leaving.
They all look at her, stupefied. She must be insane.
LINDERMAN
What? Why?
LORI
Think about it. He said "Come to
Freddy." Freeburg was being
controlled. Freddy wants to take
Jason out...so he pulled him into
the dream world.
WILL
So? Let 'em fight each other. Better
for us.
LORI
NO! Don't you see? Jason is the only
thing standing in the way between us
and Freddy! That's why he wants him
gone...so Freddy can have us all to
himself!
KIA
What are you saying?
LORI
I'm saying maybe Jason is our best
shot at beating Freddy now.
LINDERMAN
What...exactly...do you have in
mind?
Beat. Lori stares back at Jason's body on the floor...

84.
EXT. KATJA DREAM CLINIC - NIGHT
The four of them stand outside the clinic, huffing and
puffing. The van is parked right next to them. Linderman is
stacking TWO BOXES of tranquilizers, and is looking through
the MANUAL we saw next to them on the counter.
WILL
How long will it last?
LINDERMAN
(looking at the book) I don't know.
But he got hit with the concentrate.
Totally undiluted. It's like one
part per 1000.
KIA
And that's good?
LINDERMAN
Well a box of this stuff should be
strong enough to sedate Cincinnati
for a year.
LORI
Good. Them give him another dose.
Linderman fills up a syringe. Kia looks at Linderman a
little differently. There's respect there for the first
timeKIA
Glad you're here, Linderman.
Linderman can't help but smile a bit. But his smile fades
when Lori opens the back of the van, and we see Jason
inside, flat on his back. They all look to each other,
terrified.
No one moves. 'Are we really gonna do this??'
INT. CARLOS' VAN - MOVING - NIGHT
Linderman sits on the floor, eyes closed, mumbling. Sounds
like a prayer. Kia sits across from him, doing the same.
But most of the van is being taken up by JASON'S MASSIVE
BODY, lying flat on the floor. Jason's white mask glows
eerily under the BLACK LIGHT. Clearly, this is the absolute
scariest place on Earth to be.
WILL's at the wheel. Lori in the passenger seat, flipping
through the PAGES Linderman printed up on Jason Voorhees...

85.
WILL
(quietly) Why don't we just try and
do it here?
LORI
We can't leave him here in town. Too
many people could get killed.
WILL
But why go all the way to Crystal
Lake?
LORI
Well best case scenario, they'll
kill each other, and it won't matter
where they are. But if Jason wins,
and he's back at the camp...he'll be
home. Back where he belongs. Why
would he follow us back? It'll be
over.
WILL
And if Freddy wins?
Beat. Lori looks at him gravely...doesn't answer.
WILL (CONT'D)
Well. At least Jason gets home field
advantage. --Do you know how insane
all this sounds? Look at them back
there.
LORI
(starting to doubt herself?) I know.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
A POLICE ROADBLOCK with barricades is set up on the
outskirts of town. Deputy Stubbs leans against his cruiser.
He looks to the road, sees a VAN's headlights coming closer.
He waves his hands for them to stop. The Van has to pull
over.
INT. CARLOS' VAN - SAME
They all look to each other, know they're screwed. Stubbs
ambles up to the Van's open driver's side windowDEPUTY STUBBS
Sheriff has a curfew set. You kids
need to get home. --Lori? That you?
You OK?

86.
LORI
I'm fine. Thanks.
Deputy Stubbs shines his flashlight in the back. Stubbs sees
a large BLACK TARP. Something BIG underneath it.
DEPUTY STUBBS
What's in the back?
KIA
You don't wanna know, believe me.
Beat. He shines the light on each of their terrified faces.
DEPUTY STUBBS
OK. Everybody out.
LORI
Deputy...listen to me, please. You
have to let us through. I know you
can see how twisted this town is
right now, including all the
Sheriff's men. And I know you're not
a part of it.
In the distance, there's red and blue flashes coming from
another cop car as it drives up the road toward them...
LORI (CONT'D)
We're trying to do something here.
To help everyone. But if you stop
us, they'll lock us up. You know
that.
DEPUTY STUBBS
What are you trying to do? I might
be able to help.
The police car comes to a stop. A COP gets out...
LORI
Please. There's no time. You helped
me once before. Trust me...not them.
Beat. Stubbs looks back to the tarp, then to the cop headed
towards them with a suspicious look. Stubbs turns to LoriGo.

DEPUTY STUBBS

THE VAN PULLS OFF...and the other cop walks up to Stubbs,
and hands him a cup of coffee from his thermos.

87.
SHERIFF'S OFFICER
What was that?
DEPUTY STUBBS
Out-of-towners looking for a
shortcut. Told 'em to get back on
the interstate.
The cop nods...walks back to his car. Stubbs turns to look
at the Van, disappearing from sight...wonder on his face...
INT. STUBBS' POLICE CAR - SAME
Stubbs behind the wheel, his mind racing. He grabs the C.B.
DEPUTY STUBBS
This is Car 12. Helen, see if you
can get ahold of a station in a town
called Crystal Lake...
INT. DEPTHS OF DREAM WORLD - NIGHT
POV FROM BEHIND JASON - Freddy approaches the restrained
Jason from the front, confronts him face to face. He pulls
off Jason's mask. We only see the back of a misshapen skull.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Now there's a face...
Freddy motions to something on the ground in front of JasonFREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
...only a mother could love.
REVEAL: There, impaled on a wooden stake, is the HEAD of
Jason's mother. Jason doesn't move. Doesn't even flinch.
Freddy looks frustrated. He seems to get an idea. Freddy
takes the BLADE on his index finger...and begins pushing it
slowly into Jason's head...probing into his brain...
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
Let's dig a little deeper...
We PUSH IN on Jason's head...going inside his brain...his
thoughts...we see synapses firing...electricity.
FREDDY KRUEGER (OS) (CONT'D)
...See what really scares ya!
MATCH CUT - the synapses firing turn into LIGHTNING
streaking across a black sky draped over a shadowy, twisted
landscape.

88.
INT. JASON'S MIND - DREAM WORLD - SAME
We've never seen anything like this. The place resembles the
landscape around Crystal Lake, as Death might interpret it.
Trees, on closer inspection, seem to be made of corpses.
Rocks are skulls. Water is blood.
It's a chilling vision. This guy's got issues.
A woman's SCREAM cuts the silence...and we see Jason emerge
from the shadows, dragging a VICTIM behind him. He heads
toward a house. But...the house isn't all there. Walls are
crumbled, missing...only the front door seems intact.
A shadow falls INTO FRAME. It's Freddy, watching...as Jason
moves through the front door...
INT./EXT. CARLOS' VAN - NIGHT
The van speeds along an empty highway. Will still at the
wheel, Lori still in shotgun. It's been a long ride.
IN THE BACK, Linderman and Kia stare at each other, Jason's
unconscious body between them. Linderman watches as Jason's
finger twitches ever so slightly. He fills up the syringe
with more tranquilizer...
KIA
Didn't you just give him one?
Linderman can only shut his eyes and nod...
WILL (OS)
We've been driving all night. It
can't be much further.
LINDERMAN
This can only end badly. For all of
us.
Kia and Linderman stare at each other. He's panicking.
LINDERMAN (CONT'D)
I mean it. I got a sick feeling in
the pit of my stomach. This thing's
gonna wake up and we're all gonnaKIA
Linderman. Please. You're not
helping.
Linderman shuts his eyes again, nodding...breathing deep.

89.
LINDERMAN
If we don't make it out of this...I
just wanna say...I'm sorry for what
I said to you at the rave.
I...didn't mean that.
KIA
Yes you did. It's OK. You were
right.
LINDERMAN
Yeah...well...even though you were
such a bitch to me...I still always
thought you were the prettiest girl
in school.
Beat. Kia actually manages half a smile.
KIA
Thanks, LinderJason's LEFT ARM FLIES UP...and they both JUMP BACK against
the sides of the van. Then, just as suddenly, Jason's still.
LORI
What happened back there?!
Linderman plunges the syringe into Jason's neck, empties it.
KIA
(staring at Jason) Nightmares.
INT. JASON'S MIND - VOORHEES' HOME - DREAM WORLD - SAME
Back in Jason's head. Jason moves through the doorway.
Through the static from an old radio, MUSIC from the 1950s
drifts creepily through this stale brown old-fashioned
house.
Jason drags his victim across the floor toward the
CLOSET...opens it...tosses the body inside, then slams the
door shut. Jason heads back outside. This is a routine.
Never ending.
Freddy moves toward the closet door...curious, excited. We
hear a distant scream outside - another one of Jason's
victims. Freddy slowly opens the closet door...
FREDDY KRUEGER
I'm dyin' to see what skeletons are
hidden in your closet!

90.
This is impossible. We're looking underwater, like at an
aquarium, but there's no glass. Suddenly, a white CORPSE
floats across the doorway, startling us. As it passes, we
notice HUNDREDS of other bodies, drifting in every
direction. The space in the closet seems almost infinite.
Suddenly, there's a SPLASHING SOUND. Freddy looks up, into
the closet, and sees something on the water's surface. It
looks like a young boy...splashing...perhaps, drowning?
Gotcha...

FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)

Freddy starts laughing his fucking ass off.
INT. CARLOS' VAN - NIGHT
Linderman drives another syringe into Jason's mask...
LINDERMAN
We're running seriously low on
trank. I've got enough for maybe one
more does...plus enough for Lori.
WILL
We're almost there.
LORI
Then I better get going.
Beat. Lori gets out of her seat, heading for the back...
WILL
Lori...how do you even know this is
gonna work?
Will shoots her an uneasy look, turns back to the wheel...
LORI
Last time I fell asleep, I pulled
part of Freddy back from my dream.
This time, I'm just gonna bring back
the whole goddamn thing.
WILL
But...how are you gonna find him?
LORI
I won't have to. Whenever I close my
eyes, he's always there. He'll find
me.

91.
Lori starts moving, but Will slams on the brakes and pulls
to the side of the road. They stop. He grabs her arm...
WILL
I don't want you to go.
We can see in his eyes how much he really cares for her...
LORI
I'm coming back. Just give me 15
minutes, then wake me up. I'll bring
that bastard back through. You just
make sure Jason's waiting for him.
She sets the ALARM on her watch. She's got all the answers,
but still he can't let her go...
WILL
I don't like the idea of using that
tranquilizer on you.
LINDERMAN
I'll give her the smallest dose
possible. Less even than that the
Clinic recommends for her height and
weight.
Linderman tosses the MANUAL to the floor, grabs a SYRINGE.
WILL
OK. I'll make you a deal. You make
sure you come back...and I promise
I'll never leave you again.
Boom. This hits Lori unexpectedly, right to her heart. It
takes every bit of will she's got not to cry right here.
Deal.

LORI

He pulls her close, and they KISS. Once. Pure. Passionate.
Kia looks to Linderman, but he has already looked away.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
The VAN flies by at high speed.
INT. CARLOS' VAN - SAME
Will at the wheel, Kia has shotgun. In the back, Linderman
pricks the needle into Lori's arm.

92.
They don't notice as Jason's head shakes once. As as we PUSH
IN on Jason's face, his closed eye under the mask twitches
from REM sleep...
INT. DREAM WORLD - DAY
A beautiful lakeside CABIN on a bright sunny day. An
unblemished wooden sign reads: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
Happy CHILDREN are escorted by CAMP COUNSELORS. LORI walks
through the scene, but no one seems to notice her. She looks
around, notes her surroundings with care: judging by the
cars, clothes and hair, it looks like the late 1950s.
Lori notices a GROUP OF KIDS taunting another CHILD. They
form a circle around him, pushing and shoving him. The child
behind shoved has his head down. Lori can't quite see his
face. But he's no older then eleven...
CRUEL CHILD #1
Freak-show! Freak-show!
One child pulls a CLOTH SACK over the child's head...
CRUEL CHILD #2
Cover that ugly face!
Monster!

CRUEL CHILD #3

Lori turns to the Camp Counselors, all young, no older then
eighteen. They flirt with one another, could care less...
LORI
Hey. Excuse me? Shouldn't you be
doing something?
Seems like they can't even hear her. Lori moves over toward
the children as the child breaks free from them, and runs
toward the lake, ripping off the cloth sack as he goes.
CRUEL CHILD #2
RUN, Jason! RUN!
Jason? Lori walks slowly toward the little boy. He runs to
the end of the wooden pier...his back to her...
ON THE DOCK
Lori walks onto the dock. The young child at the other end.
LORI
Jason? Jason Voorhees?

93.
The child turns slightly. Lori can't really see his face,
but something looks wrong, like he's mildly deformed. Lori
moves away from the dock, heads toward a CABIN...
INT. CARLOS' VAN - WAKING WORLD - NIGHT
Lori is asleep, her head laying next to the unconscious
Jason. Linderman watches closely, checks his watch...
LINDERMAN
I's been two minutes.
Linderman empties a syringe into Jason's neck.
WILL
Let's do this. How we doing on
trank?
KIA
That was it. We're out.
Beat. They all look to each other. Will pounds the gas...
EXT. CABIN - DREAM WORLD - DAY
In front of the cabin now. But Lori suddenly hears a SPLASH
coming from the lake, followed by thrashing in the water.
She looks back at the dock...but little Jason is gone.
LORI
Oh my God.
She BANGS on the cabin's door, trying to find help...
LORI (CONT'D)
HEY! I think a kid just fell in the
lake! Anybody in there?!
The door OPENS from her pounding fist...Lori runs inside.
INSIDE CABIN
On the other side of the room, TWO CAMP COUNSELORS are
having sex standing up. He's thrusting her against the
wall...
LORI
There's a boy drowning out there!
MALE CAMP COUNSELOR
(his back to Lori) Can't you see I'm
busy?

94.
LORI
(can't believe it) You're not
coming??
The camp counselor turns his head back toward Lori
revealing: FREDDY KRUEGER'S FACE! And the woman he's
embracing is DEAD.
FREDDY KRUEGER
It's not my fault, this bitch is
dead on her feet...
Freddy throws his head back, cackling. Lori runs out of the
cabin screaming, finds herself suddenlyON THE DOCK
-running on the wooden boards toward the still splashing
Jason. She runs to the end of the dock, wants to save him...
HANG ON!

LORI

Lori reaches her hands down for him...grabs Jason's hand.
Jason's HEAD pops out of the water, and Lori seems him
clearly for the first time...and little Jason is gruesome
looking.
But in his eyes, there is unmistakable FEAR.
OH!

LORI (CONT'D)

The sudden shock of seeing him was too much, and she let his
hand go. Jason goes back under, fights again to swim...His
little hand comes back up, and she reaches again...BUT
FREDDY POPS UP FROM THE WATER, and FORCES JASON BACK DOWN!
FREDDY KRUEGER
AH HA HA HA!
He's dunking poor little Jason over and over again...
NOO!

LORI

Freddy's face goes cold, holds Jason under longer this time.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Ah to be young and drowning again!

95.
The young boy screams in terror. This is what Freddy wants:
JASON IS AFRAID . Freddy can kill him now...
INT. CARLOS' VAN - WAKING WORLD - SAME
On the floor of the van, Jason's CHEST HEAVES...a gasping
sound coming from the mouth of his mask. Lori asleep next to
him. Kia and Linderman are up, trying to back away.
KIA
Something's wrong back here...let's
get rid of this goddamn thing!
LINDERMAN
We're not there yet...
WILL
Is Lori OK?? What's going on??
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DREAM WORLD - LAKE - DAY
Back on the dock, Lori checks her watch, looks to Freddy as
he holds Jason cruelly under the water. He's almost drowned.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Say 'HI' to your ma for me...IN
HELL!
But suddenly, JASON VANISHES. He's gone.
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
NO! I HAD YOU!
INT. CARLOS' VAN - WAKING WORLD - NIGHT
Linderman is shaking Lori, trying to wake her up...
KIA
Wake her up, Linderman!
LINDERMAN
I'm trying!
WILL
What's going on back there??
CLOSE ON - JASON'S MASK - WATER starts to flood up through
the holes in the hockey mask around Jason's mouth...
Kia looks at her feet, sees water seeping around then...
KIA
Where the hell is all this water-

96.
She looks to Jason as he SPRINGS UP, immediately locking a
meat-hook of a hand around her throat! Her eyes bulge...
KIA!

LINDERMAN

Linderman picks up a TIRE IRON, and cracks it against the
back of Jason's skull. Jason lets Kia go, turns around, sees
Linderman, meekly holding onto the tire iron. Whoops.
Linderman grabs a HUBCAP from the corner, holds it in front
of him like a shield, cringing...just as -WHAM! Jason
extends both his arms, PALMS CRASHING INTO THE HUBCAP...
Linderman flies backward, slams into the rear double doors
of the van, busting them open. He sails out the speeding
van, hangs in the air...then skips off the pavement, rolling
like a ragdoll...sparks flying off the hubcap he clings to.
WILL
(looking back at Jason) SHIIIIIT!
Will slams the breaks, and YANKS THE WHEEL to the right,
hard...but he's going too fast...
The van flips...and they all tumble...with Jason...until
Jason falls out the back. Along with the unconscious Lori.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
KRRISHHSH! The van slides on its side along the two-lane
blacktop, finally scraping to a stop.
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DREAM WORLD - LAKE - DAY
Freddy's hands desperately search the water around him,
looking for Jason, but finding nothing.
Lori looks to her WATCH. And then she looks back toFREDDY. Staring up at her now. His eyes narrow, his face
goes cold. Every ounce of rage that he had toward Jason is
now directed at HER.
YOU.

FREDDY KRUEGER

Freddy's face starts to distort...becoming more demonic. His
mouth opens wider as a hundred razor sharp teeth grow. The
WORLD gets twisted and DARK. His rage grows. Powerful wind
blows wildly. Lori takes a step back, when-

97.
Freddy LAUNCHES HIMSELF out of the lake like he was sprung
from a coil, and LANDS ON THE DOCK, angrier and scarier than
we've ever seen him. Lori cringes-BEEP-BEEP! BEEP-BEEP! The ALARM on Lori's watch goes off,
and Freddy looks at it...distracted for a millisecond, as
Lori lunges at Freddy's chest, TACKLING HIM by surprise!
LORI
WAKE ME UP! I'VE GOT HIM!
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
BEEP-BEEP! BEEP-BEEP! Lori's watch sounds off. But the van
is wrecked. Will and Kia stand behind it, looking at Lori
and Jason lying in a heap on the road, limbs tangled, both
unconscious. BEEP-BEEP! Her watch continues to sound.
WILL
(psyching himself up) OK. Alright. I
can do this.
Will carefully walks over to Lori...reaches down and pulls
at her arm...dragging her away from Jason. But then...her
body stops. Caught. Her leg is stuck under Jason's arm.
BEEP-BEEP! Will motions to Kia silently for help. Kia shuts
her eyes, can't believe what she has to do. Kia's hand
trembles as she reaches for Jason's hand...she actually
TOUCHES and moves Jason's arm.
...and Will is able to drag Lori to a safer distance. He
tries to wake her as best he can, even slaps her in the
face.
WILL (CONT'D)
Lori...wake up! LORI!
A trickle of blood on her forehead, Lori's out for the
count.
Look...

KIA

Will looks to see an old battered, broken and moss covered
sign at the side of the road: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE.
WILL
We're here. Alright, let's get her(looks back at the van) Oh no.
They turn to look at the van...and Jason's body is gone.
Will's eyes go wide, he starts to pick up Lori...

98.
WILL (CONT'D)
Start running...just go. GO!
Will hoists Lori on his shoulder...and starts moving away
from the road. Kia running with him...
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DREAM WORLD - LAKE - DAY
BEEP-BEEP! BEEP. Lori's alarm stops. Lori still lying on top
of Freddy on the dock. She hasn't woken up. She's stuck in
the dream world with Freddy.
FREDDY KRUEGER
So...you wanna be on top?
Lori jumps as Freddy laughs maniacally. Lori runs down the
dock, trips...and keeps FALLING...INTO BLACKNESS...
BAM! Lori hits the ground. She gets up, and brushes DIRT off
her clothes. She looks up and realizes she's at the bottom
of a deep hole. She starts climbing out...
EXT. 1428 ELM STREET - DREAM WORLD - NIGHT
Lori climbs out of the hole, sees she's in her BACKYARD. The
swing set is just behind her...and it's now NIGHT TIME. Her
clothes have changed: now she's wearing a WHITE NIGHTGOWN.
LORI
...I'm back home... (beat) ...C'mon
guys, wake me up...please...
EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WOODS - NIGHT
Will runs through the woods with Lori over his shoulder...
WILL
...C'mon Lori...please wake up...
In the distance, at the edge of the woods, is an old run
down CABIN. They run toward it...
As they go, they pass ANOTHER SIGN. This one's bright, new,
metal, and reads: FUTURE HOME OF LAKESIDE RESORTS .
INT. CABIN - SAME
Will gingerly puts Lori down onto the floor. He runs and
drops a wooden plank across the cabin door, bolting it. This
cabin is seriously old and deteriorated. Kia's terrified...

99.
KIA
Just like we're camping, Kia.
Everything's gonna be fine...
Will lights an old kerosene lamp...
WILL
We'll be OK. I'll make the smores.
He shoots her a nervous look, then tends to Lori...
OUTSIDE THE CABIN
CLOSE ON - a TREE STUMP with an AXE sticking out of it, the
cabin in the b.g. Suddenly, someone yanks the axe out.
BACK INSIDE - Kia moves to the side window, peeks out:
KIA
Looks like they're building
something out there. I see...a
trailer, with a light on. Maybe
someone's in there...
EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEARBY - SAME
Outside the cabin, past the clearing and beyond some trees,
we see construction on a NEW BUILDING has recently begun.
Strung across the top of it, a long BANNER.
Near it is a CONSTRUCTION TRAILER with a small sign in front
that says: "Lakeside Resorts Office."
INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT
Florescent lights buzz over a long table where SEVEN welldressed but exhausted looking executive-types sit. Looks
like they've been working all day. Papers piled everywhere.
ASSHOLE EXECUTIVE
Well, team...we had a lot of last
minute details to hammer out...but
we finished it. I'll give the final
contract to the Builders when they
get here in the a.m.
They smugly smile to one another but one WOMAN looks unsure.
FEMALE EXECUTIVE
Look, we got this land cheap for a
reason. We can't ignore the...how
should I say...

Colorful history...associated with
this site. We might not get much
local penetration. There's a
petition going around started by
one- (beat, looks at her notes) 'Tom
Jarvis' to stopASSHOLE EXECUTIVE
Fuck Tommy Jarvis! He's a lunatic!
The locals aren't our target
clientele anyway. And the finale
word on it is mine...got it?
Thunder and lightning crash. They all look to one another,
slightly spooked. Beat. A serious storm is rolling in...
EXT./INT. 1428 ELM STREET - DREAM WORLD - NIGHT
Lori opens the back door to her house and goes inside. She
sees her FATHER heading up the stairs...a KNIFE in his hand.
LORI
Daddy! NO! Don't do it!
He can't seem to see or hear her...
UPSTAIRS
WHAM! Lori's father kicks in their bedroom door, sees
tussling under the sheets. He brings up the knife...Lori
runs into the room, her father rips back the sheet...
LORI (CONT'D)
Please Daddy don't kill her!
...revealing his WIFE and no one else. But her body shakes,
almost LEVITATING off the bed. CUTS form on her bodyDR. CAMPBELL
COME OUT AND FACE ME FREDDY!
And that's when it hits Lori. She staggers back as it's
revealed who REALLY killed her mother...
FREDDY APPEARS on top of the poor woman's body, claw raised.
Freddy turns to Lori, blood on his face...
FREDDY KRUEGER
I've always had a thing for the
bitches who live in this house.

101.
Lori RUNS out of the room...and Freddy dives after her...
WAKING WORLD - CABIN
Will is desperately trying to wake Lori. Something catches
Kia's eye outside. She can just barely see through the space
between the boards that make up the walls...
KIA
I see something! Something outside!
Something is moving outside. She can only catch glimpses.
Was that an arm? ...a mask? ...the blade of an axe??
CLANK-CLANK! She screams when a COP appears in the window,
rapping his flashlight on the glass.
CRYSTAL LAKE COP
HEY! You kids from Springwood? I got
a call about you. C'mon outLori runs down the hall, but the floor ripples, knocking her
over. She looks back, sees Freddy walking toward her. Behind
Freddy, Lori's father exits the bedroom carrying his WIFE in
a bloody sheet. He heads downstairs, eyes blank...
DR. CAMPBELL
I'm sorry Elaine. But don't worry, I
won't let him get Lori. She'll never
find out about him...about any of
this.
Dad disappears down the stairs, heading for the backyard.
Freddy PICKS LORI UP with one hand and tosses her into the
hall mirror. CRASH! She falls to the floor...
WAKING WORLD - CABIN
The COP banging louder on the window...Kia backing away...
CRYSTAL LAKE COP
C'mon now, I'm not playing aroundLori's body suddenly JERKS AWAY from Will...moving across
the floor as if pulled by unseen strings.
LORI!

WILL

CUTS appear on Lori's arms and chest...SHE SHAKES...

102.
CRYSTAL LAKE COP
(staring at Lori) What the hell are
you doing to her??
KA-KRISH! The cop EXPLODES through the window...tumbling to
the ground in a heap of broken glass and splintered wood!
Behind him JASON stands, his axe in both hands. He tramples
the rest of the wall down and marches inside.
A piece of the wall strikes the table...and the KEROSENE
LAMP smashes on the floor, spreading FIRE...
Will and Kia scatter across the room.
Jason turns on them, axe in hand. Will looks over to Lori,
lying unconscious on the floor. Lori's body JUMPS as if
tossed, lands hear the spreading flames. Will runs to her...
DREAM WORLD - LORI'S HALLWAY
...Lori is a bloody mess, can no longer fight. She just lays
there, trembling, eyes closed on the hallway floor.
Freddy is upon her...this is the end. Freddy gets on his
knees, embracing her...breathing heavily on her...
FREDDY KRUEGER
I should warn you, Princess...
...he moves a finger blade up her leg...lifting her
nightgown slightly, leaving a tiny slice on her inner thigh.
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
The first time tends to be a little
messy...
Lori reaches up, grabs his SWEATER in her FISTS...one last
but of fight left in her...
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
...and painful.
WAKING WORLD - CABIN
The first is all around Lori, Jason marching towards her.
Will grabs Lori by her ankles, tries to drag her away from
Jason and the worst of the flames...but Lori's arm is
dragged through the fire...BURNING HER!
DREAM WORLD - LORI'S HALLWAY

103.
Lori screams, ARMS CLINGING TO FREDDY...
WAKING WORLD - CABIN
Lori wakes up in the cabin. Will staggers back, sees: FREDDY
CROUCHED OVER LORI, about to end her life!
DIE BIT-!

FREDDY KRUEGER

Freddy reels back to kill Lori, but HE STOPS when he sees:
JASON with his axe already raised over Lori's head.
One bone, two dogs. The two predators FREEZE. Freddy and
Jason size each other up like a hellish Sergio Leone flick.
Lori rolls away from them. Will pulls her close...
WILL
(nervous, under his breath) Freddy
vs. Jason...place your bets...
Will, Kia and Lori back the hell away from them. The fire
spreads across the floorboards.
Jason steps forward and swings down hard with his axe.
Freddy easily evades, and Jason slams it into the wall...
FREDDY KRUEGER
You think I'm afraid of you now that
we're in the REAL WORLD?
WHISSH! Freddy slashes at Jason's side quickly, then pulls
back. Jason pulls out his axe, turns...unfazed.
WHOOSH! Another swing with the axe sideways, but Freddy
jumps back, the blade just missing his chest.
Will, Kia, and Lori back up away from them...
LORI
...this way...this way...
They move toward the hole in the wall that Jason made...but
Freddy cuts off the exit while maneuvering around Jason...
FREDDY KRUEGER
You're slow, stupid, AND YA
STYLE!

GOT NO

104.
Jason THROWS his axe at Freddy's head with incredible speed.
THOOM-THOOM-THOOM - WHACCK! Freddy ducks and it barely
misses his head, almost scalping him, sticking in the wall.
Freddy looks to Jason, eyes wide. Jason marches at Freddy,
tossing aside rotting furniture, pulling out his machete.
Curtains go up in flames, the wall catches fire. This old
place is going up fast...WHOOSH!
A BURST OF FIRE blooms and Freddy recoils, doesn't like
fire. He turns away from it as Jason brings down his
machete. Freddy does his best to deflect it with his claw...
...And KICKS JASON in the groin, hard. No reaction.
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
No balls, huh Voorhees?
Jason takes his other hand, grabs Freddy by the front of his
sweater, and easily tosses him across the room.
OUTSIDE THE CABIN
SMASH! Freddy flies through the window, lands in a shower of
glass on the ground...HARD on his back. He squirms in pain.
(This is the real world, he's mortal. He can feel pain.)
BACK INSIDE CABIN
Jason moves to follow Freddy when -BLAM! His machete KICKS
BACK with a spark, hit by a bullet. Jason turns, sees:
The Crystal Lake COP, pointing a revolver at Jason with a
trembling hand. Jason moves toward him. BLAM-BLAM! The cop
unloads his gun into Jason's chest. No effect.
The cop staggers back, fleeing out the hole in the wall.
Jason pursues him, EXITING the cabin, leaving Will, Kia, and
Lori alone. They immediately tend to Lori, who's hurt...
EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
BLAM! The cop fires at Jason as he comes through the hole in
the cabin. There is a long CANOE PADDLE leaning against the
cabin wall. Jason reaches out, grabs it...
CLICK-CLICK! The cop is out of bullets...he trips...and
Jason is upon him.
The cop has no weapons left, only a flashlight. Jason cocks
back with the paddle, about to end him...when the cop shines
the flashlight in Jason's face. Clicks it on and off.

105.
Jason hesitates...then smashes the paddle down anyway. We
only see the result: the cop, on the ground, bleeding from
the top of his head, his own flashlight shining in his face.
ANGLE UP - ROOF
Freddy's on the roof of the cabin behind Jason, pushing on a
tall WEATHER VANE. Lightning streaks across the sky.
JASON!

FREDDY KRUEGER

Jason turns, looks up sees: The weather vane falling down on
him. It stabs into his chest.
Jason stumbles back...He yanks it out as KRA-KRAK! A bolt of
lightning knifes down...
But Jason has tossed the weather vane into the air. KOOM!
The lightning bolt strikes the weather vane.
Freddy jumps from the roof, onto Jason...looking to tackle
him. But Jason doesn't budge. He catches Freddy...gets him
in a bear hug and starts crushing him. Freddy wails.
Jason lifts Freddy over his head...and throws him toward a
tree with inhuman strength. Freddy flies fifteen feet, then
WHAM! His spine connects with bark, and he crumbles.
Will and Kia help Lori out of the cabin. They see Jason
heading for Freddy on the ground. Now's their chance to run.
KIA
C'mon! We'll run for the road!
No...

LORI

WILL
If there's people in that
trailer...we should warn them.
KIA
I'll go. You take care of her...
Beat. Will and Kia lock eyes. They share a moment.
I will.

WILL

Kia runs into the woods leaving them. Will starts to help
Lori along, but she suddenly stops, the fog clearing.

106.
WILL (CONT'D)
C'mon, Lori...we're leaving...
LORI
No! We have to stay!
WILL
Why?? You got what you wanted! You
pulled Freddy out and Jason's
fighting him! What more do you want?
PUSH IN on Lori...into the fire reflected in her eyes...
LORI
He killed my mother, Will. It was
Freddy. My Dad covered it up to
protect me. He didn't do it.
Beat. Understanding and relief wash over Will's face. Then
it hits him. The ramifications of what this means.
LORI (CONT'D)
Freddy ruined both our pasts. But we
can still do something about the
future.
Will looks deep into her eyes. He made a promise to never
leave her again. And he's gonna keep it.
WILL
OK. Let's make sure this
motherfucker goes down.
They look over, see Freddy hobbling away from Jason. He
can't take him on hand-to-hand. Jason's too strong...
INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - SAME
A few EXECUTIVES are at the window...
NERVOUS EXECUTIVE
You had to hear it that time!
ASSHOLE EXECUTIVE
Just thunder, Phil. Look, you wanna
take five? Go ahead, step out, clear
the noodle. When you come back, I
know you're gonna zaz me with a new
slogan.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

107.
PHIL exits the trailer cautiously. He can just make out a
cabin in the distance. Behind him and the trailer, down a
short hill, is the area under construction.
He sees a GIRL (KIA) break through the trees. A moment
later, a GUY IN A HOCKEY MASK appears behind her.
PHIL
It's him. My God...it's all true!
As she runs, Kia TWISTS HER ANKLE and falls to the ground.
He's almost on her. She staggers up...
KIA
...wait a minute...wait a minute...
(trying to remember) ...they said
it's our fear that gives him his
power...our fear...
Kia stands, confident...and FACES JASON HEAD ON.
KIA (CONT'D)
I take back all the fear I gave you!
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU...so you can't
hurt me anymore! I TURN MY BACK ON
YOU!
Kia turns her back on Jason...but she's a little confused.
Will said it's Freddy who needs their fear. Just then,
Freddy moves in front of Kia, and smiles.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Wrong one, bitch.
Kia's eyes go wide as Jason lunges forward behind her-THWOCK! Kia falls to the ground. Freddy laughs, runs. The
EXECUTIVE watches mouth agape, feet stuck to the ground.
PHIL
OK Phil, lift your loafers...go go
go.
INSIDE THE TRAILER
Phil runs back in and slams the door behind him.
ASSHOLE EXECUTIVE
Phil? You look like you just shat
the bed, pal. What's up?
PHIL
Outside...there's, there's...

108.
ASSHOLE EXECUTIVE
Just spit it out, guyTHWOCK! The end of Jason's machete blade erupts from Phil's
throat, the blade coming all the way through the trailer's
metal door. They all jump and scream...
OUTSIDE THE TRAILER
Freddy and Jason just outside the trailer...Jason slams
Freddy into its metal door, crushing it.
Freddy spins, does his best to slash at Jason...but misses,
taking out the POWER BOX next to the door. KOOM!
The lights cut off inside, and the trailer starts ROCKING.
FIFTY YARDS AWAY...AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE
Lori and Will are scrambling...
WILL
What am I looking for??
LORI
Gas, paint thinner...anything
flammable!
Will looks up, sees Freddy and Jason tearing at each other
around a trailer, fifty yards away at the top of a hill.
CLOSE ON - The TRAILER'S WHEELS - The Wooden TRIANGLES
situated on both sides of the trailer's wheels so it won't
move are rattling from the abuse the trailer is taking...and
the tires start to move.
INSIDE THE TRAILER
Mayhem. The executives don't know what to do...
PANICKED EXECUTIVE
I can't get a signal on my cell
phone!!
KRISHT! Freddy's claw split through the metal wall,
screeching down, literally cutting long holes in the metal.
Freddy pulls himself inside, trying to escape Jason...
FREDDY KRUEGER
(ala "three little pigs") Corporate
pigs, corporate pigs... LET ME IN!

109.
They try and run away...but there just ain't too much room
in here. Jason pounds away at the metal trailer, opening the
hole wider so he can get in too...BOOM! BOOM! Unstoppable.
CLOSE ON - the WHEELS under the trailer. The triangles are
gone now, and the trailer STARTS TO ROLL along the slight
grade, heading for the construction site...
CONSTRUCTION SITE
With trembling hands, Lori and Will fill up a large SPRAY
CANNISTER with gasoline from a red metal can...
INSIDE THE TRAILER
The trailer, bumping up and town, rolling along slowly.
Jason and Freddy are at either end of the trailer...nothing
but terrified execs in between them. Freddy laughs at them.
FREDDY KRUEGER
AIIGH! Don't kill me!! WE'RE SO
AFRAID!
Jason moves toward Freddy. Freddy stabs a terrified exec in
the back, and uses him like a SHIELD. But Jason promptly
punches the human shield in the face, his heck breaking at
an inhuman angle. Freddy tosses the body at Jason to slow
himThe trailer is picking up speed, bumping along faster...
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
You could cut the fear in here with
a knife! LIKE THIS!
Freddy slashes at TWO EXECS pinned near him, and they fall.
Freddy jumps on top of their backs, looking to escape
through the trailer's narrow ROOF HATCH...climbing up whenJason grabs Freddy's leg and yanks him down like a ragdoll.
With the other hand, Jason immediately grips Freddy's
throat, chocking him, lifting him on-handed with amazing
strength...
THUCK-THUCK-THUCK! Freddy repeatedly JABS at Jason's neck,
trying to get free of Jason's death grip whenBAM! The trailer moving faster and faster suddenly JOLTS
HARD as it runs over something in its path. Jason and Freddy
tumble, Freddy momentarily free from Jason's grip...
Freddy quickly scrambles back up through the roof hatch.

110.
ON TOP OF THE TRAILER
Freddy stands on top of the trailer, sees it's about to ram
into the construction site. He looks down the hatch, sees
Jason climbing up after him. Freddy gets an idea...
FREDDY KRUEGER
Come and get me you stupid mute!
Jason pulls himself through the hatch, half-way out whenEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME
BA-BOOM! Jason's CHEST connects hard with a construction
beam...as the rest of the trailer careens into the rest of
the half-built building. Freddy is thrown from collision...
KRUDGE! The shell of the building collapses all around them
as the trailer splits open on impact...
A long PROPANE TANK attached to the end of the trailer
breaks free, and rolls toward Will and Lori...about to
squash them!
Will and Lori DIVE out of the way, and teh tank SLAMS into
the beams, getting wedged in. Smoke and debris fly.
And when the dust settles, Freddy is on the ground in a
heap.
LORI
Is he dead??
Will spies: ROPE attached to the bottom of a lift suspended
from the second story. On the lift are cinder blocks, bags
of cement. The other end of the rope lays near Freddy...
WILL
I'm not taking any chances...
Will grabs the rope, loops it around Freddy's NECK.
LORI
Will! Get away from him! Let Jason
finish him!
Will grabs a rusty putty KNIFE from the ground and moves
over to the PULLEY SYSTEM that raises and lowers the life...
WILL
He will. I'm just making sure they
stay in one spot...Then you hit 'em
with the gas. BOTH of them.

111.
Will starts CUTTING through the pulley cords...
KOOM! Jason bursts up through the top of the mangled
trailer...and starts heading for Freddy.
Will cuts through one of the cords, and ONE SIDE of the lift
above falls...the other side still held by the second rope.
CLOSE ON - FREDDY - One eye pops open, and is that a grin on
his burnt lips? LORI notices, horror washing over her face.
LORI
Will...wait!
Will cutting through the cord faster, Jason right in from of
Freddy now, he reaches down...as Freddy springs to life!
SNAP! Will cuts through the cord as Freddy quickly takes the
rope off his own neck and loops it around JASON'S...
NOO!

WILL

ZWWWWIP! Jason's LIFTED INTO THE AIR...but KOOM! The lift
wrecks halfway down...but Jason's body is still suspended a
few feet off the ground. Freddy cackles. Will rushes at
Freddy...but he easily slices at Will's arm and he crumbles
to the ground. Freddy turns back to JasonFREDDY KRUEGER
Look! A retarded pinata! Let's see
what's inside!
Freddy slashes at Jason. Jason is limp. Another blow. AGAIN
and AGAIN. Jason swings on the rope...
LORI looks by the trailer, sees: JASON'S MACHETE. She runs,
picks it up...arches back with it...
LORI
Hey FREDDY!
Lori throws the machete with all her might, but Freddy moves
out of the way. OH NO! The machete sticks into Jason's leg.
FREDDY KRUEGER
You stupid whore! YOU MISSED!
LORI
(knows something Freddy doesn't)
Yeah??

112.
Behind Freddy...Jason reaches down, pulls the machete from
his own leg...and cuts the rope over his head.
Jason drops to the ground, landing on his feet. The
construction lift, now free, starts FALLING...
Freddy's turned to Lori, still laughing...as -CRASH! The
lift nails the ground. Freddy spins around in time to see
Jason plant a devastating blow with his machete into
Freddy's side! Freddy screams in pure agony. He falls to the
ground.
Freddy looks up, sees: JASON standing over him in all his
bloody glory. The Lakeside Resorts BANNER FLOATS DOWN gently
behind Jason ala Jurassic Park. The banner says:
"CRYSTAL LAKE WELCOMES YOU BACK"
And that's when Jason KICKS FREDDY in his side...lifting him
up...sending him rolling toward the lake's shore...
EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
Freddy drags himself as quickly as he can toward the lake,
Jason stalking slowly behind him as he always does...but
he's not exactly in good shape either.
AT THE DOCK
Freddy stumbles onto the deck, his blood spilling on the
wood. He can barely stand...
FREDDY KRUEGER
C'mon Jason...I'm trapped...
Jason moves onto the dock after him. LIGHTNING FLASHES.
AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE
Lori runs to Will on the ground, cradling his bleeding arm.
WILL
Get the gas...
She spies Freddy leading Jason down the dock...
LORI
(getting an idea) Fire and water.
They nod to each other. Lori takes off, Will tries to standON THE DOCK

113.
Freddy stands at the dock's end, Jason heading for him.
Jason swings at Freddy with his machete, but Freddy evades.
EDGE OF THE LAKE
LORI begins pumping the gasoline all over the ground...all
over the end of the dock...
ON THE DOCK
Jason raises his arm, rushes the blade down, but Freddy
steps to the side...LUNGING for Jason's mid-section.
FREDDY KRUEGER
INTO THE DRINK, MAMMA'S BOY!
WHAM! Jason staggers back, right at the edge...but Jason
locks his other hand around Freddy's throat and squeezes.
Jason lifts Freddy off the ground...arches back with his
machete for the deathblow when...
...Freddy drives two blades from his glove into Jason's eye
sockets - right through the holes in the mask. The blades go
all the way through the back of Jason's skull.
But Jason swings with his machete anyway CUTTING OFF
FREDDY'S GLOVE AT THE WRIST! Freddy falls to the deck,
howling.
NOOOO!

FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)

Freddy lays in a HEAP on the deck, bleeding, cowering.
Impotent without his blades. Jason rips the severed glove
sticking out of his face, throws it down. It lands on the
wooden deck, close to the edge.
Jason stumbles around, like he's blind. Freddy crawls toward
his glove...slithering on the wood...
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
(distracting him) Wait...we should
be a TEAM! I've got the
brains...you've go the brawn...
Freddy stretches for his glove, almost got it, Jason
staggers around blind, shuffling his heavy boots on the
deck...
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
...let's kill shitloads of people!

114.
BOOT! Jason accidentally kicks Freddy's glove into the lake
just as Freddy was about to grab it...
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
ARRGH! You dumb FUCK!!
THWOCK! Jason swings down blindly with his machete, chopping
into the wood INCHES from the defenseless Freddy...
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
WAIT! WAIT! YOU WIN! OK? IT'S OVER!
And that's when we see it: FEAR IN FREDDY'S EYES.
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
Now please...let's stop this. We can
still get them!
Freddy looks over to LORI, standing safely on dry land. Lori
tosses out a piece of burning wood. WHOOSH! The ground and
dock start to go up in flames.
FREDDY KRUEGER (CONT'D)
Shit. Always with the fire...
NEAR THE CONSTRUCTION SITE
Will sees the flames spreading on the dock. He hobbles up to
one of the TRUCKS by the back of the construction site. It's
a make-shift delivery truck for the PROPANE TANKS.
He smashes open the driver's side window with a rock, and
throws a lever...
WHIIIIR! Like a dump truck, the flatbed of the truck lifts,
and the long propane tanks start to roll back. But then,
they stop. The lock on the wooden gate is holding them back.
With his one good arm, Will grabs an IRON PIPE and starts
smashing the padlock on the wooden gate...
CHING! It finally gives away, and the tanks SPILL OUT...
ON THE DOCK
THWOCK! Another blow, closer this time... Freddy on his
knees, at Jason's feet, no where else to squirm. He's a
goner. He looks up at Jason, at his vanquisher, sees:
There...through a gaping hole in his rib cage... is Jason's
beating black heart. Freddy gets an evil grin...

115.
FREDDY KRUEGER
I take it all back.
With the last bit of strength left in his war-torn body,
Freddy quickly stands up an buries his one good hand deep
into the hole, deep into Jason's chest, SQUEEZES...
...And RIPS JASON'S HEART OUT! The machete drops, and Jason
falls into the lake. Freddy stands alone on the dock, lifts
Jason's heart high into the air in victory...
NO!

LORI

WILL (OS)
LORI! LOOK OUT!!
Lori looks back, sees SIX PROPANE TANKS rolling down the
hill toward the dock...picking up speed. She takes off...
FREDDY KRUEGER
(turns to where Lori was) Eat your
heart out, bitFreddy stops mid-sentence, eyes going wide as the TANKKA-BOOM! The first tank his the flames and explodes, raining
FIRE! Freddy's blown into the water, burning!
INT. CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME
BOOM! BOOM! As the tanks continue to explode one by one,
Freddy sinks into the water... one hand gone... and still on
fire. He struggles to swim back up when...
...JASON'S HAND LOCKS ON HIS ANKLE...AND PULLS HIM DOWN!
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME
Will and Lori are hunched over for cover as the last propane
tank explodes. They look to the burning lake...
WILL
Look! Something's happening!
Fire mixes with the water... not going out. The flames are
on the surface...everywhere. The water seems to be bubbling
and churning...
INT. CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME

116.
It's no use...Freddy can't break free from Jason, can't hold
his breath any longer. But there's something else now. They
seem to be caught in a current. In a lake??
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME
The water is indeed MOVING...
LORI
The water. It's going down.
(realization) They're going back.
WILL
Back? Back where?
LORI
Back where they belong.
INT. CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME
As Freddy and Jason sink, the water around them is CHANGING
COLOR. Getting brighter. Like something is GLOWING RED
beneath them. Freddy looks down, sees:
There's a hole (or perhaps, a portal?) at the bottom of the
lake. It glows red.
FREDDY KRUEGER
(unintelligible screaming)
Freddy and Jason now both appear lifeless as they move
faster toward their inevitable destination.
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME
Lori and Will watch wide-eyed at the bubbling, red-hot lake
as the water level drops...
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DAWN
Morning. The lake is completely dry. Will and Lori sit next
to each other by the dry lake's edge, holding hands.
LORI
It's over.
WILL
Maybe it was an earthquake...a fault
line opened or something...
Lori looks to Will. He doesn't believe that either.

117.
WHIRRR! The SOUND of a siren behind them. Lori and Will
stand up, see: DEPUTY STUBBS pulling up in his cruiser.
Lori turns, and sees her FATHER getting out from the car.
She walks to him. But she stops a few feet from him. No
embrace. There's emotional distance between them.
DR. CAMPBELL
Lori. I'm so...so sorry. I only
wanted to protect you. I would have
done anything to protect you from
him. I wasn't going to lose you too.
LORI
You could have told me. You should
have told me.
Emotion washes over Lori's father. He moves in to embrace
her...and she lets him. Dr. Campbell's eyes flash to Will
behind her...staring at him. Not exactly ready for a hug.
Dr. Campbell breaks his embrace from Lori, addresses Will.
DR. CAMPBELL
Lori's mother was Krueger's last
victim...and you were the only loose
end. The town thought...we
thought...we were doing the right
thing. But we had no right...no
right toWILL
No. You didn't. But...it's all over
now. He's gone.
Dr. Campbell nods, then looks away. Ashamed to look at Will.
DEPUTY STUBBS
Found this one by the side of the
road...
Stubbs indicates someone else in the back of the cruiser.
Someone heavily bandaged. Lori can't believe her eyes.
LORI
Linderman??
She runs to him. He stays in the car, looking at her through
the open car window. He's pretty banged up...but alive.
Kia?

LINDERMAN

118.
Lori holds back tears. Shakes her head "no."
Will?

LINDERMAN (CONT'D)

Lori nods and smiles, a tear falling now. Linderman grins.
I'm glad.

LINDERMAN (CONT'D)

INT. CRYSTAL LAKE - MORNING
They walk down into the lake bed, now dry as a bone. Only a
few dead fish and seaweed suggest water was ever here.
LORI
Freddy used Jason to get back to Elm
Street, but Jason got him in the
end.
WILL
I don't know. I saw Freddy holding
Jason's heart. Krueger was the last
man standing.
DR. CAMPBELL
So then...who won?
DEPUTY STUBBS
You're still here, and they're not.
They lost. Simple as that.
Lori and Will share a look, hold hands. Dr. Campbell sees
something gleaming on the ground a few feet away...
DISTANT VOICE (OS)
HELLO DOWN THERE? What the hell
happened here?!
Lori, Will and the Deputy turn toward the VOICE. They see a
CONSTRUCTION WORKER standing next to a BULLDOZER at the
lake's edge, scratching his head under his hardhat.
Dr. Campbell moves to the object... It's Freddy's glove.
DR. CAMPBELL
It's time to destroy this. For good.
He bends over, picks up the glove off the ground. Lori turns
to him...and he holds it up for them to see. Just as-

119.
Freddy's red and green striped arm shoots up through the
ground, grabs Dr. Campbell, and yanks him down into the
earth by one leg!
One leg buried in the dirt, he SCREAMS, reaching for help...
DAD!!

LORI

ANOTHER YANK and his other leg is forced up against his
chest, breaking at an impossible angle. And then, he's gone.
Lori falls to her knees, screams to the ground beneath
her...
NOOOOOO!

LORI (CONT'D)

Lori SCREAMS, CLAWS at the DIRT, DEVASTATED...
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. HELL
SFX SHOT: On his knees, Freddy slowly slips his glove back
onto his hand. He flexes the blades, feels good to be back
on. ThenEverything SPEEDS UP..to normal speed...as Freddy rolls to
his right...barely avoiding a huge BATTLE AXE that crashes
into the red cracked earth.
Freddy gets to his feet, striking an incredible pose. Jason
in front of him, raising the axe high over his head for
another blow...
An UNSEEN CROWED CHEERS...
AND AS WE QUICKLY PULL BACK:
Freddy and Jason move at each other, battling in a deep pit,
surrounded by the eyes of a thousand dark demons and a
million tortured souls.
CUT TO: BLACK
