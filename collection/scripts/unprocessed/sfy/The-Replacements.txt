THE REPLACEMENTS - Rev. 9/30/99
FADE IN:
1

EXT. MARINA - DAY

1

The water around the moored boats looks dirty and cold.
ROLL CREDITS as we PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat
sitting in an end slip -- a seagull-shit-covered, thirtyfoot cabin cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long
time. An unpainted plywood addition has been nailed to
the top of the cabin, partially covered with a blue
plastic tarp.
SUPERIMPOSE:

ANACOSTIA MARINA - WASHINGTON D.C. - FALL

The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked torso emerges
from under it. Shane is late twenties, golden boy
handsome, but quickly going to seed. He looks hung over.
MUSIC UP:

"My Own Worst Enemy" by LIT.

Shane glances up at the clouds. He pulls on the top part
of an old patched wet suit and zips it up, shivering.

EXT. MARINA - ON SHANE

in an old Zodiac inflatable dinghy. He's pulled up the
attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the
white of his face is visible. He pulls up to the yacht
across the way from his boat, ties the dinghy to the rear
rail and clips a bill for services rendered on the stern
line.
He slips on a weight belt, puts on a pair of old gaffertaped goggles, jams the end of an air hose in his mouth,
and falls backward into the water.

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

It's dark and murky as Shane descends dreamlike INTO
FRAME. All that we hear is the shooting sound of his
AIR HOSE echoing across the river bottom as we -SMASH CUT TO:

QUARTERBACK

getting decimated by a defensive lineman. The lineman
drives the quarterback to the turf in an ugly and violent
collision.

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

Shane uses a long spatula to slowly and methodically
attack the underside of the sailboat. The spatula
scrapes away the green algae muck revealing the pure
white underside of the boat as we -SMASH CUT TO:
3C

QUARTERBACK

3C

getting hit high and low in a vicious pass rush as the
air is blasted from his lungs.
BACK TO:
3D

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

3D

Amidst the beer cans and other trash something golden is
sitting on the river bottom. Shane takes a deep pull on
his hose and drifts down...
A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky water and
reveals a broken trophy half-buried in the mud. Shane
kneels over and picks it up. The trophy is almost a
full-sized football rendered in bronze and attached to a
broken base. He wipes away mud from the plate with his
thumb.
CLOSEUP - INSCRIPTION
SHANE FALCO - 1995 ALL-AMERICAN TEAM.
SMASH CUT TO:
3E

QUARTERBACK

getting speared by a lineman's helmet. The CRACK of his
RIBS is all that we hear as he turns his head to us,
revealing the anguished face of Shane Falco five years
earlier.
BACK TO:
3F

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

3F

Shane bends down as if behind an imaginary center. He
barks garbled signals as he cocks his left leg, takes
the snap, and drops back. But there's a blitz! He steps
up in the pocket, bobbing and weaving in a kind of
delicate ballet.

Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his
arm.
The trophy comes behind his ear and snaps forward
in a perfect release.
The football spins OUT OF FRAME, but we HOLD ON Shane as
he watches his pass. Suddenly, he throws both arms up in
a touchdown signal.
We STAY ON Shane in this victory pose, fifteen feet
underwater on the muddy bottom of the Potomac River, as
we -END CREDITS.

INT. NEXTEL STADIUM - O'NEIL'S LUXURY BOX - SAME TIME

5

Where we find EDWARD O'NEIL, the red-faced, 75-year-old
owner of the Washington Sentinels.
Sitting obliviously at his side is his wife; a once-upona-time blonde bombshell now held together by collagen and
silicone. She's busy at work on a Post crossword puzzle.
MRS. O'NEIL
What's a six letter word for
'exuberant'?
O'NEIL
'Divorced.'

binoculars)
Tildon, you moron!
MRS. O'NEIL
'Divorced' is eight letters...

EXT. NEXTEL STADIUM - FIELD - DAY

We see quarterback EDDIE MARTEL running for the end zone
when he is confronted by a safety smaller than he is.
Martel goes down in one of those wimpy quarterback slides
before the safety can even hit him.
7

INT. NEXTEL STADIUM - O'NEIL'S LUXURY BOX - DAY
O'Neil throws down his binoculars.
O'NEIL
Martel, you wimp!
He begins to cough hoarsely before taking deep breaths,
dramatically, as if Martel's play was the one that was
actually going to send him to his grave.

Washington locker room for a
reaction from the players. Dwight?

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

A handsome former wide receiver and now TBS Sports
reporter, DWIGHT EDWARDS, stands before quarterback Eddie
Martel.
DWIGHT EDWARDS
Eddie, there's a lot of angry fans
out there tonight who feel that
the players are being too greedy
in their demands. Anything you'd
like to say to that?
MARTEL
Look, I know that five million a
year sounds like a lot of money.
But I gotta pay ten percent to my
agent, five percent to my lawyer,
plus alimony, child support -(CONTINUED)

EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Several of the cheerleaders walk out of the stadium,
laughing and making plans for the evening, completely
unaffected by today's events. Until we see ANNABELLE
FARRELL step out. She looks pissed enough for all of
them.
Annabelle!

MARTEL (O.S.)
She looks over to see Martel grinning as he leans against
the hood of his Porsche.
MARTEL
I thought we could have a drink.
ANNABELLE
I thought you could have scored...
She walks past him as he follows...
MARTEL
I hear most of the cheerleaders
are gonna walk out in a show of
solidarity.

She doesn't.
MARTEL

ANNABELLE
I'll lighten up in the off-season.

She gets into her car as Martel grins and shakes his
head.
MARTEL
Listen to you. Maybe you should
be team captain instead of me.
ANNABELLE
At least then they'd have a leader
with some balls.
Martel's smile fades as he watches her drive off...

EXT. NEXTEL STADIUM - NIGHT

An empty stadium.
Quiet as a church, it sits in contrast to the din of
spectacle only hours ago. We SINGLE OUT O'Neil's private
box high above the stadium as we hear a quiet SNORING...

INT. NEXTEL STADIUM - O'NEIL'S LUXURY BOX - SAME TIME
The old man sleeps soundly, peacefully. And then we hear
ICE CUBES SLOSHING IN a GLASS. He blinks his eyes open

O'Neil motions to the glass. McGinty pours three fingers
from a Glenlivet bottle into a plastic cup before handing
it over. O'Neil sips his whiskey, smiling as it goes
down.

Now gimme a butt.
I quit.

Nobody likes a quitter.

Nope.

McGINTY
O'NEIL
Liar. Could you believe that

McGINTY
What did you expect? You've been
bottle-feeding those babies

like that aren't gonna take a
chance at getting hurt before a
strike.

You're right. I've got the wrong
guys out there. On the field and

McGinty laughs.
O'NEIL
Look, I'm too old and too
impatient to screw around so let
me put it to you straight: I want
you back.
McGINTY
You already have a coach.
O'NEIL
I'll take care of that...
McGINTY
Like you took care of me?
Now, Jimmy --

O'NEIL
McGINTY
You don't even have any players.
They all flew home on their jets
to their castles, remember?
O'NEIL
We're gonna finish the season
anyway. We're gonna use
replacement players.
McGinty laughs as they reach the field...
McGINTY
Jesus, what a business.
O'NEIL

O'NEIL
You won for me once. You can do

O'Neil starts out across the grass to the middle of the
50 yard line where we see the logo for the Washington
Sentinels. McGinty pauses at the edge of the field, as
if it were the deep end of a pool. O'Neil gives a sly
smile.
O'NEIL
S'matter, Jimmy?
Jimmy shoots him a look before stepping onto the field
and walking out after him. It's been a long time...
O'NEIL
Look, nobody is gonna give you
another chance like this after
that Dallas mess...
McGINTY
(getting hot)
I was right.
O'NEIL
It's not about being right! You
went head-to-head with an eightmillion-dollar quarterback! Who
did you think was gonna win? But
that's not gonna happen here. I'm
talking about a team of poor
nobodies who play to win. Not a
bunch of bitchy millionaires.
McGinty looks downfield for a beat.
Jimmy...

O'NEIL
McGINTY
Shut up, I'm thinking...

Total control of my team? You let
me recruit who I want, with no
interference.
O'NEIL
My word is my bond.
McGINTY
I want it in writing.

O'Neil chuckles. Suddenly from behind them we see the
enormous JUMBO-TRON DIAMOND VISION screen suddenly
flicker to life. At first it seems like a malfunction...
but then we see the face of a younger Jimmy McGinty come
into focus.
O'NEIL
Hmm... gotta get that thing
fixed...
O'Neil smiles and walks up the steps for his box.
McGINTY
You old bastard...
But he can't turn away. It's his life up there. A
montage of photographs of his past triumphs as coach...
a famous last-minute touchdown catch... players dousing
him in All-Sport... the team holding him up on their
shoulders... McGinty holding a trophy over his head in
celebration...
CLOSE ON McGINTY
as the glow of the enormous screen reflects in his eyes,
sealing the deal as we hear...
McGINTY (V.O.)
Let's get to work!

INT. HEAD COACH'S OFFICE - DAY

McGinty is sitting behind his new desk. The logo for the
Washington Sentinels hangs proudly on the wall.
McGINTY
Whataya got for me?
Standing before him are the offensive coordinator, LEO
PILACHOWSKI, an asthmatic who regularly takes hits from
an industrial-size inhaler, and CHRISTOPHER BANES, an explayer and defensive coordinator.
BANES
Well, we thought we would skip
special teams for the moment.
It's gonna be tough enough just
putting an offense and a defense
together in seven days.

McGinty doesn't say

PILACHOWSKI
Okay. Here's a list of every
player cut this past season. What
we'd like to -McGINTY
(pointing at the list)
Those people? Those people were
cut for a reason.
(hands the list back)
We're gonna go another way here...
McGinty takes out a list of his own.
McGINTY
This is a list of people I've kept
an eye on over the years. They've
all played football somewhere, but
only a few in the pros. And
they've all got something...
unique to bring to the game.
We're gonna take these people and
try to put together a winning
team. And if nothing else, they
should be fun to watch...
Pilachowski and Banes look at McGinty's list, then back
to him, hoping that this is a joke. But McGinty only
smiles.

BIKER
Did you hear something?

The other biker shakes his head, no. They go back to
work. Suddenly, the door disintegrates in front of a
charging man wearing a police windbreaker. This is
DANIEL BATEMAN, a big, young, psychotic cop, who
immediately knocks one of the bikers down and kicks the
guy in the head.
McGINTY (V.O.)
Daniel Bateman, L.A.P.D. and exNavy SEAL. Awarded a Purple Heart
for losing a kidney during combat
in the Gulf War. He was a walk-on
at Michigan State before giving up
football and sneaking back into
the service for one more tour of
duty.
BANES (V.O.)
But... you said he lost a kidney
there.
Bateman viciously head-butts one of the bikers before
stuffing the other's head into the meth mixture.
McGINTY
I guess he went back to find it.
He pulls him out and clubs him with a big police
blackjack, whap! Bateman looks around and spots a big
Biker cowering in a corner. The guy is terrified.
Bateman gives him a sick smile. But then three more
POLICEMAN run in, out of breath. They look around at the
unconscious Bikers.
POLICEMAN #1
Jesus, Bateman! Why don't you
ever wait for us?!
BEEP! BEEP! Someone's BEEPER is going off. The three
cops look at theirs. Nothing. The cowering Biker looks
at his.
Not me.

A man dutifully sweeps up outside the rundown mini-mart

BOY runs out of the door. The KOREAN STORE OWNER steps
outside as he screams:

The Little Boy has a long lead on Franklin. But Franklin
kicks it into hyper-drive and begins to close the gap...
McGINTY (V.O.)
Clifford Franklin, he was a 100
meter qualifier in the Olympics
before he pulled a hamstring in
the final trials. Great attitude.
Great desire. And the fastest son
of a bitch I've ever seen...
The Little Kid can't believe that Clifford is catching
up.
Here!

LITTLE KID
Take it! Take it!

The Kid tosses the Twinkie back over his shoulder...
PILACHOWSKI (V.O.)
But can he catch?
SLOW MOTION as the Twinkie spins end over end through the
air. Franklin holds up his hands, sucking the air
through his Breathe-Rite nose and exhaling through his
cheeks as the Twinkie hits his hands... and falls to the
street. He steps on it as cream filling squishes from
beneath his track shoes.

As we see what has become of The Leg. Nigel Gruff is
standing on top of the bar, holding a Guinness as he sings
"Better to be a Welshman" to his drunken friends.
He wears an old T-shirt two sizes too small and sweat
pants that have been cut into shorts which show off his
now spindly legs. A cigarette dangles from the corner of
his mouth and we get the feeling that the only weights he
lifts are the pints of beer he puts away. He finishes
the ditty as his friends cheer.

Drinks are on the house, mates!
Everyone bum-rushes the bar. But as he hops down off of
the counter he finds himself face to face with three

I want you to quarterback 'em.
Shane just looks at him.

Waiting for the punchline.

McGINTY
A scrambling quarterback is gonna
do real well in this replacement
environment. I've found the best
guards available to protect you.
And a wide receiver that even you
can't overthrow.
I'm retired.

SHANE
McGINTY
Yeah. And it looks like things
have gone real well for you since.
SHANE
I got no complaints. It's quiet
here. Nobody bothers me.

Your team leaned on you and you
crumbled. Is that how you want
to be remembered?

Shane shrugs and stares out to the water.
SHANE
I don't wanna be remembered at
all.
He pulls a ratty old sweatshirt over his head and walks
over to the door to his tiny cabin as McGinty stands up.
McGINTY
You're still young. You still got
bags of talent. If you do well,
who knows what will happen when
the strike ends?
Shane looks up...
McGINTY
I can't make you any promises,
Shane.
McGinty points to the boats in the harbor.

McGINTY
Welcome to professional football.
We SLOWLY PAN ACROSS the faces of the replacement players
as McGinty continues:
McGINTY
There are some who will say that
your accomplishments today will
soon be forgotten. That you're not
'real' players and that this isn't a
'real' team. Well I say that's
bullshit. Because as of today you
are professional football players.
And the difference between
professional and amateur, between
playing for the Washington
Sentinels and Michigan State, is
that this is your job. Just like
you worked at the mini-mart, and
you worked in the shipping yard,
and you worked at the auto plant,
and you...
(stops on Wilkinson)
... well, you were in jail, but
the point is you are now being
paid to play. And that's a
privilege few athletes will ever
know. I want you to remember
that. Because the men whose place
you're taking forgot it a long
time ago.

Hey! There they are! Ladies and

They all crack up as our players look to each other to
see if anyone is going to stand up to them. But nobody
is.

Murphy, our deaf player, is at the counter writing down
his drink order for the bartender as Martel laughs.

Hell, he's the luckiest guy here.
At least he couldn't hear the

And then Shane suddenly swings. But Martel easily ducks
it and Shane connects instead with the huge striker
standing at Martel's side. The huge striker only smiles.

But leadership means nothing if a

I'm sorry, Shane. I'm sorry,

SHANE

FUMIKO
Consider it done.
SHANE

McGINTY (V.O.)
When the replacement players for
the Washington Sentinels left the
stadium that day there was no
ticker tape parade. No endorsement
deals for sneakers or soda pop or
breakfast cereal. Just a locker to
be cleaned out and a ride home to

part of something great. And
