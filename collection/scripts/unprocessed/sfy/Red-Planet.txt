MARS - VARIOUS SHOTS

1

Starkly beautiful, operatic landscapes. Panoramas
revealing the Red Planet's arid, forbidding features:
Flat, rocky plains stretching to the horizon. Red dunes
of fine sand. Ancient flood channels. Abyssal canyons
six miles deep.
CHANTILAS (V.O.)
As our own planet reaches a point
where it may be uninhabitable
in fifty years, we have begun the
process of colonizing Mars...

EARTH - FROM SPACE

The familiar blue marble. Only it's not so blue anymore.
More a sickly yellow-gray.

EXT. AMERICAN CITYSCAPE - DAY (2050)

A brutal, polluted, Malthusian nightmare. Daylight so
bright it hurts. The sulphurous, ozone-less sky casts
a pall over streets teeming with people, many wearing
respiratory devices and sun-protective clothing.
CHANTILAS (V.O.)
... Even as oxygen levels drop
dangerously on Earth, algae
introduced on Mars has been
creating what we hope will one day
be an oxygen supply capable of
supporting human life...
3A

EXT. MARS - VARIOUS SHOTS
More images depicting 40 billion years of celestial
evolution unchanged by man:
Vast craters.

Icy, white polar caps.

An immense volcano, the base of which (though we have no
reference for scale) is large enough to cover Arizona.
A bright yellow sun setting in a pale gray-blue sky.
CHANTILAS (V.O.)
... Complications are part of
every endeavor, however. And
recently, the oxygen on Mars began
to decline. In order to discover
the reason --

As a mother readies her young son for school, on a
TV we see a closeup of Bud Chantilas, 60. Chironed
below his name is a title: "Chief Science Officer."
CHANTILAS (V.O.)
-- We are about to embark upon the
most ambitious undertaking in the
history of human exploration: the
first manned mission to Mars...
The mother hands her son a lunchbox and raincoat. Slips
a respirator over his mouth and nose. Then kisses him
and sends him out the door.
CHANTILAS (V.O.)
... I am honored to be among the
six people -On the TV we begin seeing images of five other people:
four men and a woman, ages thirty to forty.
CHANTILAS (V.O.)

undiffused sunlight blasts through open blinds.
CHANTILAS (V.O.)

another planet...
She snaps the blinds shut, plunging the room into
welcome darkness... A darkness which then becomes the
deep black of...

EXT. SPACE

The endless universe. Uncomprehended numbers of faraway
galaxies and star systems. An oceanic emptiness to

The whole thing slowly turning as it floats (at 17,000
mph) silently through space. As the ship floats by,
REVEAL... Mars. Very large. Very close. Under which we

acquired orbit. Congratulations
on 182 days of smooth sailing, and
welcome to Mars. Houston out.

BURCHENAL
To hell with the chit-chat. After
six months, I'm ready to get outta
this hamster cage. What do you
say, Bowman?
Yeah.

PETTENGILL
How about it?

They're all chomping at the bit, and Bowman knows it.
She pauses. Then -BOWMAN

dinner on Mars.
In a SERIES OF CUTS, we see the crew's individual

Chantilas and Santen attach microchip biosensors to
their chests. Santen's still working on his chewing
gum.
SANTEN
Last football game in high school,
all the college scouts were there
... I knew I had to go out and
play four perfect quarters... That
game was my ticket out...
CHANTILAS
... I played rugby to hit and get
hit.
Santen's still lost in his own thoughts.
SANTEN
No room for mistakes today,
either.
Beat. Chantilas sees how keyed up Santen is. By way
of making a counterpoint to his nervous energy -CHANTILAS
My granddaughter's six today.
Yeah?

SANTEN
Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'

CHANTILAS
Sang it to her live... As live as
one can be with a twenty-minute
transmission delay.
Beat.

Santen stops chewing, momentarily calmer.
SANTEN
... She's turning six, and her
Grandad's taking the first step
on Mars...

Chantilas nods.

Santen starts working the gum again.

SANTEN
Big day... Very big day...

Chantilas and Burchenal make a final inventory of
scientific gear to be transported to Mars. Chantilas
hands over a piece of equipment.
CHANTILAS
Better give the soil analyzer one
last calibration test.
As Burchenal begins doing this -BURCHENAL
Got a nice speech planned for
when you take that first step?
CHANTILAS
I've organized a few well-chosen
words.
BURCHENAL
... Armstrong's line was good.
Tough to top that one.
CHANTILAS
I'm not always consumed with being
superior.
It's a friendly jab. They're comrades after six months.
Burchenal laughs it off. Hands back the analyzer.
BURCHENAL
It's dead on. Battery's at max
charge.
(then)
Once you've had your big moment,
we can start figuring out why
oxygen levels took a nosedive
up here.
CHANTILAS
All of mankind's relying on us to
find an answer.
(as a punchline)
And I'll be relying on you.
BURCHENAL

If anyone can do it, it's me.

Six high-g seats are arrayed inside the small descent pod.
Stenciled-on names identify who will sit where. Santen
and Pettengill check the MEV's onboard systems as Bowman
finishes pre-flighting the controls at her command seat.
Santen's still working his gum.

He laughs, gives Pettengill a slug in the arm. Then heads
out, passing Gallagher. Snags Gallagher's aloha shirt,
wads it and tosses it back over his shoulder at him.
Re: Santen, when he's gone -PETTENGILL
Life's just like high school.
GALLAGHER

As they cross to storage compartment and begin pulling
out a heavy, metal box -PETTENGILL
Who're you kidding? You're a
jock. You were on the NASCAR
circuit...
GALLAGHER
I tuned engines. Not exactly
jock stuff.
(then)
Ears're still ringing.
As they lower the box, we see stenciled on it:
"Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion" with the
first letters of each word emphasized: AMEE.
Gallagher slides a spacesuit sleeve onto his arm. On the
sleeve is a flexible screen. He activates it, and...
The metal "box" suddenly comes to life. Unfolds like a
Swiss Army knife. Extends four legs and a "head."
Stands up on the two hind legs.
As AMEE unfolds, the screen on Gallagher's arm flicks
on. On it, we see whatever AMEE sees in AMEE-Vision
(basically a 180+ degree modified fish-eye panorama).
Gallagher whistles.

AMEE WHISTLES back.

Hey, sweetie.

GALLAGHER
PETTENGILL
She our navigator or your
girl friend?
GALLAGHER
Hey, it's been a long flight.
(checking her systems)
Looking good... Let's check
your T.I.
He turns off the light.
On the sleeve screen we see what AMEE sees in the dark:
a thermal image of Gallagher and Pettengill. Pettengill
throws some punches in her direction. AMEE doesn't move.
PETTENGILL
Military removed her old reflexes
before they transferred her, huh?

PETTENGILL (CONT'D)

She's your kind of woman.
Beat. Gallagher switches something in AMEE's circuitry.
Hands her a pen.
GALLAGHER
Gut him like a fish.
In a flash, AMEE thrusts her arm out at Pettengill and
whips it upward. A blur of movement... But we see the
result: there's a line drawn from Pettengill's navel to
his sternum. Pettengill shocked by the speed of the
attack. Looks down at the ink mark running up his suit.
GALLAGHER
That's my kind of woman.
PETTENGILL
Real goddamn funny.... She
could've hurt me.
GALLAGHER
Don't make fun of my honey.
They took away her knife, but
underneath she's all Green
Beret.
Gallagher fiddles with AMEE's circuitry again.
GALLAGHER
She's back in navigator mode...

Okay, you're good to go.
He whistles.

AMEE WHISTLES back.

GALLAGHER
Back in your box, sweetie.
As her head and limbs fold up once more...

Wham. A panel light starts to flicker red. At the same
time, the flight deck windows suddenly go black. More
lights flicker. Some just go off. ALARMS start RINGING.
SANTEN
What the hell's going on?
Bowman quickly begins to reset states. Some hold, some
flip back to red. Cabin lighting begins to flicker.
BOWMAN
Single event upsets. All over the

Bowman finishes preparing to abandon ship. She's about
to go. Reaches for a panel marked: "MEV Launch
Release." Flicks a toggle to "Arm." The toggle won't
hold, snaps back to "Disarm." She tries again. Same
result. The toggle won't stay on "Arm" unless Bowman
holds it there manually. It only takes her a moment to
decide what to do next. She's not happy about it, but
tries not to let her concern show -(CONTINUED)

Santen hesitates.
Seals the hatch.

Has no choice... He POWERS UP MEV.

They're not just leaving her behind -- they know that by
staying, Bowman could very well be sacrificing her life.

remaining spacesuit -- hers -- deflates the hanger that's

face and secures it, whereupon air begins feeding into
the suit... Bowman gulps it, relief for her searing lungs.

INT. MARS-1 - MEV DECK - DAY

48

The fire breaches the hatch to the access tube. Bowman's
hurled across the room by the effect of the fire. Beat.
Her eyes go to something. She launches herself towards a
safety tether attached to a wall. Clips on. Reaches for
a control panel marked "MAIN HATCH" and throws it open.
And...
... instantly, Bowman's sucked toward the hatch, until --- WHAP! The TETHER SNAPS TAUT. Almost breaks her in
half. Bowman a ragdoll on the end of the line. Every
loose object on the ship starting to purge past her.
Smacking into her. Bouncing off her. The fire purging,
too. Streaming around her body and head, nearly cooking
her alive as it vents into space.
49

INT. MARS-1 - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
Everything that's not lashed down is sucked toward the
Main Hatch... And then, as pressure equalizes with the
vacuum of space, the stream of flotsam slows and stops
flowing... The fires subside and die. The ship is still
and dead.

The ALARMS CEASE. With the pressure equalized, Bowman's

tether. She hauls herself to the controls. Shuts the
hatch... The immediate danger's over. And Bowman finally
allows herself a moment to be terrified.

MEV crushes down on the uneven terrain. Bounces.

MEV hits it.

Air bags tear open.

INT. MEV - DAY

The ride's now worse. There's no cushion on one side.
Chantilas is directly over the unprotected area. He
takes the brunt of each impact.
A horrible jolt rips loose Chantilas's g-seat. He's
battered and rolled as MEV continues to tumble.
He's a
threat to all of them as he bashes about with each
rotation. He takes a monstrous beating.
54

EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY

54

MEV slowly grinds to a halt. The bags that aren't in
shreds begin to deflate. The icosahedron unfolds. Opens
like a flower... And then silence. Utter quiet that
seems to last forever. When...
... the hatch blows. A figure steps out. Gallagher. A
moment later, Chantilas is passed through the hatch.
He's unconscious. Gallagher drags him a short distance
away as one-by-one, Santen, Pettengill and Burchenal

Congratulations.
GALLAGHER

That's one small crash for man,

Chantilas and Burchenal smile. For Pettengill, it's
no laughing matter. And the joke makes Santen
uncomfortable.

Chantilas is propped against a rock, moving a device the
size of a paperback book across his abdomen. It's a kind
of combination x-ray/sonogram. He doesn't like what he
sees. Clicks it off without showing anyone.
Nearby, Santen finishes doing something with his HHC
(book-size, 2050 descendant of a laptop).
SANTEN
Distress signal's away.
Gallagher emerges from MEV.
GALLAGHER
Radio's dead. AMEE's screwed
up... Repairs are gonna take time.
Burchenal and Pettengill have been looking through a pile
of broken equipment. Exchange a glum look. Then -BURCHENAL
Science package is k.o.ed, too.
Shit.

SANTEN
PETTENGILL
No more mission.
SANTEN
Mission's not over yet,
Pettengill.
PETTENGILL
Oh, really. You miss something?
We lost the science gear. We
can't do what we came here to do.
Quit whining.

SANTEN
PETTENGILL
You're the one who parked us in

Shut the hell up! There're always

the map to show where Hab's deployed.
SANTEN
Based on the last uncorrupted nav
state, I'd say... we're in
this 60x120 kilometer ellipse.
Beat. That's big. That sucks. And Burchenal's vast
intelligence can't accept it. Re: his HHC -BURCHENAL
All the mission data's in here.
We just gotta close in on the
downrange variables. Tighten up
the ellipse. It's about the math.
GALLAGHER
This is it. That moment they told
us about in high school, where one
day we'd use algebra, and it'd
save our lives...
They're already working on it.
Shut up.

BURCHENAL
GALLAGHER
Heard that a lot in high school,
too.
Gallagher wanders off. In b.g., we hear the OTHERS
discussing drag coefficients and whatnot.
Gallagher stares out at the Martian plain. It'd be kinda
cool -- except he could die out here. He yanks his HHC
out of the pocket on his thigh. Mutters something. The
Hab details appear.

it some more. Looks up. Looks around.
Hey, guys?

SANTEN
What, Gallagher?
GALLAGHER
I don't think it's about the math,
I think it's about the picture.
What picture?
This one.

SANTEN
GALLAGHER
He holds out the HHC. They walk over, look at the
panorama on the display.
SANTEN
We're not in that picture. If we
were, we'd know where Hab was,
we're trying to figure that out.
Gallagher ignores him. Tosses a rock in the sand. Wraps
the panorama around it. As he does, the HHC screen bends
and turns translucent.
GALLAGHER
Say that's Hab. About 30 degrees
in the distance, it sees this
mountain with the funny top. At
about 180 degrees, it sees this
set of twin peaks.
(indicates)
Now, I see this mountain over
there. And these peaks over
there. And then this other peak
maybe. Which would put us on a
line, say here. Which leaves the
angle to Hab about there.

Pettengill looks at Santen, waiting to see how he'll
respond. But Santen doesn't say anything.
CHANTILAS
He has to say no.

The four of you must carry on
the mission. It won't be easy.

Get going.
The four men look down at him a moment.
SANTEN
You heard the man.
Santen starts off. Burchenal and Pettengill AD LIB
their good-byes, then follow Santen. Gallagher is last.
He's unable to go. Chantilas meets his eyes.
It's okay.

CHANTILAS
I got to see Mars...

Beat. Chantilas sticks out his hand. Gallagher
hesitates, then takes it. The two men grip hands.
Chantilas releases him. It's time to go. Gallagher
turns, begins walking away. After a moment, Chantilas
calls after him.
CHANTILAS
Keep looking for that rock.
Gallagher turns back and salutes him.

Then continues on.

Chantilas watches him a beat, then takes a deep breath...
His eyes go to a stone lying in the dust.
With his finger, Chantilas traces a line in the dust
around the stone. As he begins to trace another...

Hard. Past the edge of the cliff. Santen's eyes are
wide with shock, but his training, his athletic ability
are already kicking in.
The shove upset his balance and every part of him fights
to regain it. It happens for an instant. Arms flail,
heels dig. He reaches back. Catches Pettengill's suit,
backhand. Spins himself around. Still off balance.
Still going over the edge if he lets go. Reaching out
toward Pettengill with the other hand... And Pettengill's
following his own twisted instincts now, too.
With the shove, he's crossed an emotional threshold, and
he's not pulling back. Fights Santen's hands. Knocks
them away.
Only to find that each time they shoot right back and find
a new spot to grab. Santen's desperate, clawing. In
Earth's gravity, maybe he'd have gone over already. But
here, now... he fights his way back onto his own feet.
Away from the cliff edge. Wild with an adrenalized
survival energy that now turns to absolute fury.
Pettengill's no match for it. Santen unleashes body
blows and head butts. Savage enough to make a hairline
crack in Santen's own visor.
Even in the suit and helmet, the blows hurt. He
slams Pettengill into the dirt. Punishes him as they
roll in the red dust... but Santen begins to slow. His
breath has been growing labored. He's now gasping for
air.
Stops.
Darts a look at his readout. Still has some air. But the
exertion has been too much. The suit's depleted supply
can't feed him what he needs fast enough. He lets go of
Pettengill. Hypoxia overcoming him. Crawls away
on hands and knees. Willing himself to move. As if by
doing so he'll keep death at bay that much longer... And
now Pettengill gets up and comes over. Enraged. And...
... drives his foot down on Santen's head. Slams it into
the ground. Stunning Santen. Then stomps him again.
Santen's visor spider-webbed by the crushing blow. His
blood spattering against the inside of the cracked glass.
Like a windshield in a car accident. A fatal one.

can't stop working through all the steps again...
BURCHENAL
... Mars' polar ice is mostly CO2.
We use low-order nuclear detonation
to melt the ice. That releases
CO2. CO2 buildup creates a
greenhouse effect. Mars starts
warming up. When it's hot enough,
we seed down some algae. The
algae grows and emits oxygen.

Want me to shut up and let you die
quietly?
GALLAGHER
Nah, keep talking. It's kinda
peaceful.
BURCHENAL

what happened to the oxygen.

the algae?

It gets slightly harder to breathe... then harder

Burchenal and Pettengill barely able to watch. Know
they're next... Gallagher down on all fours now, sucking
hard on the last of his air... When suddenly all his fear
and anger and frustration peak, and in an act of
desperation and defiance, he unfastens his helmet. Pushes
back the gelatinous visor. And shouts...
GALLAGHER
Fuck this planet!
A scream against the void. Against death. The final
word dragged out to the very last bit of air in his
lungs... Burchenal looks away... The word fades... Drops
to nothing... No air left to make a sound... The next
inhale will bring no relief. But it can't be stopped.
It's reflexive. Involuntary... Gallagher shudders,
holding back. Until he can't any longer... and his lungs
contract. Sucking in the worthless Martian atmosphere...
And... something unexpected occurs... Gallagher's still
on his feet. No shock, convulsions and acidosis... He
exhales. Inhales again... Then -I'm breathing.

GALLAGHER
He turns to Burchenal and Pettengill, who are watching in
amazement.
