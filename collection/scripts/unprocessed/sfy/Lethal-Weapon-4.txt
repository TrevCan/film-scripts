Both stunned at what they're seeing.
Oh, shit...

MURTAUGH

THEIR POV

3

Hell. A dozen different fires light the street. In the
center of it all, two blocks away, walking away from
them, squirting a flamethrower with one hand and FIRING
an AK-47 with the other, a human tank wearing level-3,
full-body armor, facemask, etc. He napalms another car.

MURTAUGH
What're we gonna do?
Run him over.

RIGGS

Riggs FLOORS it at the guy.
MURTAUGH
What if he turns and shoots us with
that friggin assault rifle?
RIGGS
Maybe he won't. He hasn't yet.
Right.

MURTAUGH
But what if he does?

RIGGS
Try being positive for once, Rog.
We're cops.
MURTAUGH
Unlike you, my life matters to me.
RIGGS
You got another way to stop him?

MURTAUGH
... No. Okay, you're right, we're
cops... I hope he doesn't turn.
RIGGS
Then do be a Do-bee, don't be a

Will him.

MURTAUGH

RIGGS
Will him. Yeah. C'mon...

C'mon, Rog, will him with me...

EXT. STREET

The CAR SKIDS sideways as Riggs throws the wheel over.
The human TANK OPENS UP on them. BULLETS SHRED the
vehicle. Riggs and Murtaugh bail out and take cover
behind the wheels. There's fire all around them.
MURTAUGH
Had to turn so my side faced him?
RIGGS
There's no right turn here.
The shooting stops. Riggs and Murtaugh pop up FIRING.
SLUGS BOUNCE off the guy's body armor. They drop back.
MURTAUGH
We're in trouble.
RIGGS
It's your fault, Rog.

Okay. I'll draw his fire.

You

MURTAUGH
No, no, no. I'll draw the fire,
and you run for cover.
RIGGS
I got less to lose, so you do the
running.
MURTAUGH
You're younger, in love -RIGGS
And you got a wife and kids. Are
you nuts, Rog? I got lots less to
lose. I'm going first.
Riggs...

MURTAUGH

RIGGS
Get ready to run, Rog.
MURTAUGH
... I'm not supposed to tell you
this, but... Lorna's pregnant.
You're gonna be a father.
Riggs wasn't expecting that one.
MURTAUGH
She's afraid to tell you. You
never discussed having children.
RIGGS

What kid?

name... Just popped into my head
when you... A baby...
MURTAUGH
Yeah, a baby. And I'm older, and
I've been a dad, so I'm going
first.
RIGGS
(then)
You can't go first, Rog.
Why not?

MURTAUGH

RIGGS
'Cause there's something I'm not
supposed to tell you, too...
Rianne's pregnant. You're gonna
be a grandfather.
MURTAUGH
Rianne can't be pregnant. She's
not married... Oh, shit...
RIGGS
It was an accident. She and the
guy aren't serious... She was
gonna tell you this weekend when
you were nice and relaxed.
Riggs peeks at the human tank, now standing a short
distance away with his gun leveled. Riggs ducks back as
BULLETS RAKE the car again. Murtaugh looks sick.
MURTAUGH
Not sure I want to live now.
RIGGS
The kid needs a grandad, Rog...
Take off your clothes.
'Scuse me?
Strip, Rog.

You mean gonna shoot him in the -No, not there.

Murtaugh starts stripping.
MURTAUGH
I gotta be crazy.
RIGGS
A second ago, you didn't care if
you lived.
MURTAUGH
That was before the prospect of
ending up dead in my underwear.
RIGGS
Just hurry, Rog. It's getting a

commercial. She could've at least
used 'em

C'mon, c'mon...
MURTAUGH

I don't wanna die in my underwear.
Riggs looks.

Murtaugh's wearing pink satin boxers.

What's --

RIGGS
MURTAUGH

Not now.

RIGGS
Are those pink -MURTAUGH
Just hit the damn tank.

Not now.
Riggs drops it.

They get set to move.

RIGGS
Also, flap your arms and make
noises like a bird.
What for?

MURTAUGH

RIGGS
It'll distract him more. I need
him to turn. Ready? On two.
On two?

MURTAUGH
We always go on three.

RIGGS
Change of pace, okay?

One, two -(CONTINUED)

Murtaugh bolts from behind the car, flapping his arms and
making noises like Riggs told him. The guy turns... and
the sight does make him pause. Just long enough for
Riggs to stand and SHOOT.
Riggs' slug tears off the stem of the flamethrower tank,
releasing napalm in a high-pressure, burning jet that
rockets the human tank off the ground and through the air
toward a nearby gas station. He impacts a gas pump.
Fuel ignites. The STATION EXPLODES. A tanker TRUCK
offloading gas is BLOWN upward OUT OF FRAME.
Riggs and Murtaugh watch the inferno.

Beat.

MURTAUGH
I'm too young to be a grandfather.
What about me?

RIGGS
I'm gonna be someone's

MURTAUGH
... Think that bird thing really
helped?
RIGGS
Nah, I just wanted to see if
you'd do it.
Something catches their eye.
Oh, shit!

They look up.

RIGGS/MURTAUGH

They start running. A moment later, the tanker drops
from the sky behind them. A few tons of metal falling at
9.81 meters/second/second. Right onto their car... Riggs
and Murtaugh get to safety. Look back. Beat.
RIGGS
Never a dull moment, huh, Rog?
MURTAUGH
Not since I met you.
AD LIBS:

Wasn't that a gas?

EXT. PRISON (PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA) - NIGHT

A detail of Red Chinese soldiers waits outside the gates.
SUPERIMPOSE:

NINE MONTHS LATER

The gates open. More PRC soldiers escort out four
Chinese men wearing prisoners' shock belts. The oldest
of the four is in his 70s, dignified. The youngest is
50ish and menacing, eye like a pit viper... They're led
toward a vehicle in a waiting convoy. A young PRC
soldier touches the older man's arm to help him in. In a
flash, the pit viper strikes the soldier dead for the
offense. Executes a gravity-defying flying double kick
that snaps the soldier's neck. Another soldier quickly
jabs a button on a remote control unit. 50,000 volts
from the shock belts jolt the prisoner's bodies. Three
of them drop instantly to the ground in agony... Not the
pit viper... Incredibly, he stays on his feet. Teeth
gritted. Muscles quivering from the punishing electric
current. Staring back at his tormenter. A full ten
seconds... The soldier releases the button. The flow of
electricity stops... As the pit viper moves to help the
old man up -7

EXT. AIRPORT (CHINA) - NIGHT

The four prisoners and the PRC Army guard detail board a
large, commercial-type jet. The door's shut and sealed.

EXT. MURTAUGH'S BOAT

11

A 12-foot, live shark thrashes madly inside the cockpit,
jaws snapping. REVEAL Riggs, Murtaugh, and LEO GETZ
looking down at it from the tuna tower. Clearly, they've
scrambled there to escape the furious beast.

MURTAUGH
That shark damages my new boat,
I'm taking it outta you, Leo.
LEO
I didn't mean to catch it.
RIGGS
Then why do you want to keep it?
MURTAUGH
Yeah, what the hell you want a
a shark for?
LEO
The teeth'll look good on a wall.
RIGGS
They gotta stop snapping first.
LEO
... Maybe it'll go to sleep.
RIGGS
Go have a conversation with it.
MURTAUGH
Doesn't look tired to me.
RIGGS
Eating Leo might wear it out.
Ha-ha.

LEO

MURTAUGH
It's a thought.
Fun-ny.

LEO

RIGGS
Do sharks eat their own kind?
LEO
Stop, I'm in stitches.
Riggs and Murtaugh move to grab Leo.

Leo moves away.

LEO
Okay, okay... It's my fish, I'll
take care of it.
Leo moves off, down a hatch into the cabin.

RIGGS
Why'd we bring Leo along, anyway?
MURTAUGH
He said you invited him.
RIGGS
He told me you did.
The shark thrashes some more.
RIGGS
...Last guy trip before the
baby's here.... It's all about
to change, Rog.
MURTAUGH
Easy on the boat, shark!
Leo pops his head out of the hatch.
LEO
Where's my bag?
MURTAUGH
Starboard side aft.
Starboard.

LEO
That's left.

Port's left.

MURTAUGH
Starboard's right.

'Right,' yeah.
Leo disappears again.

LEO
Right side aft.

Beat.

MURTAUGH
Riggs... I've kept my nose out of
it, but you and Lorna... you're
having a baby... you're living
together... you're not getting
married...

RIGGS
I mean, Rianne's not exactly
married either, is she?
MURTAUGH
... That's below the belt.
RIGGS
... You're right. I'm sorry...
I was married once before, Rog.
She's dead 'cause I'm a cop.
MURTAUGH
That was a terrible thing. But
Lorna's a cop, too. I don't see
the problem.
RIGGS
The problem... The problem is,
maybe I don't wear the wedding
ring anymore, Rog, but I look
down, and it's still there.
The two men share a long look.

Leo pops up again.

LEO
You did say aft.
A-f-t.

Aft.

MURTAUGH

LEO
And that's a fucking word?
MURTAUGH
Back of the cabin, right side.
LEO
So why not just say that?...
People get around water, they
gotta talk all that nautical shit.
Leo disappears again.

Murtaugh turns back to Riggs.

MURTAUGH
What's Lorna say about this?
RIGGS
We haven't talked about it.
MURTAUGH
A few days 'til the baby's due, and
you haven't talked about marriage
at all?

Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?
MURTAUGH
Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?
REVEAL Leo's about to shoot the shark with a pistol.
No, Leo!

MURTAUGH

Murtaugh jumps, wrests the gun from him.
Jeez.

LEO
What's the big deal?

MURTAUGH
You're shooting a gun in my boat!
LEO
I was just gonna kill Jaws there.
MURTAUGH
Nobody's killing it. I'm not
letting a good animal die just so
you can have its teeth, Leo.
LEO
You're crankier since finding out
you're gonna be a grandpa.

RIGGS

This isn't mine or Rog's.
LEO
I got my P.I. license now,
right?... A gumshoe sometimes
finds himself in ugly situations.
MURTAUGH
You're an ugly situation, period.
RIGGS
It's illegal to carry a weapon
without a permit.
Riggs tosses the gun in the sea.

Blam!

A GUNSHOT.

RIGGS
Was that Leo's gun?
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
From the other direction. They
turn... and there's the bow of a two-hundred-foot
freighter about to run them down. Leo screams. Murtaugh
leaps to the helm. Jams the throttle ahead full. The
boat jumps forward... and the freighter rushes by, inches
away, snagging fishing lines, pulling poles from sockets.
And then it's gone.
MURTAUGH
My boat... Thank God...
RIGGS
The gunfire came from the ship.
Let's go, Rog.
Go where?
After it.

Whereupon a searchlight on the ship suddenly illuminates
them. Beat.
What now?

RIGGS

MURTAUGH

They hold up badges. Multiple WEAPONS OPEN UP on them.
Murtaugh throws the helm over as Riggs FIRES BACK. Nails

Murtaugh relents, steers for the ship.
MURTAUGH
They better not shoot up my boat.

Leo peeks out from somewhere.
LEO
Helluva fucking fishing trip.
RIGGS
Shut up and keep your head down.
Murtaugh pulls up alongside the lifeboat as it hits the
water, still tethered to the ship. Riggs jumps aboard
the bouncing craft, surprising two crewmen within.
Ahoy.

RIGGS

They move to shoot Riggs. Riggs NAILS both. But a
bullet parts one end of the line Riggs is holding -- a
line rigged up to the ship -- and suddenly, Riggs is
SHOOTING up into the air. In a flash, he's hauled to the
davits, drops to --

FREIGHTER

The ship approaches the shore. Riggs ends one GUNFIGHT
and gets into another, finally engaging a gunman at the
very tip of the ship's bow. The gunman's behind a large
winch, pins Riggs down with an automatic weapon. Riggs
can't hit him and can't run... when he sees the ship's
metal gunwale converging behind the gunman. Quickly
eyeballs the angles involved. Aims the laser down the
gunwale. FIRES. Banks a slug off the steel. Takes out
the gunman with a ricochet... whereupon the ship runs
aground. The abrupt stop topples cranes, everything not
fastened down, and tosses Riggs hard against a winch,
knocking his gun away... Remaining crew throw lines over
to jump ship. Riggs shakes off the blow from the winch.
Catches the ship's Captain heading for the side. The
Captain whips a kung fu move on him. K.O.s Riggs... The
Captain moves toward a rope. Two crewmen are in line to
go down. The Captain's not in a waiting mood. Pulls a
GUN, SHOOTS them both off the ship. Grabs the rope and
slides down.

MURTAUGH'S BOAT

Murtaugh's followed the freighter in, stays just beyond
the surf line near the beached ship.

LEO
I think the shark's asleep now.

BOOM! Another EXPLOSION up on the ship's deck. Murtaugh
looks up to see a burning OIL DRUM blown high into the
air. He follows the drum's trajectory.
MURTAUGH
Oh, shit... Jump, Leo.
Murtaugh shoves Leo off the boat... just as the heavy,
fiery drum crushes it. The boat instantly begins
sinking. Murtaugh bobs near Leo, looking on.
MURTAUGH

My boat...

As the boat goes down, water begins to cover the shark
and... revives it.
LEO
I think the shark's awake again.
MURTAUGH

Oh, shit!

Murtaugh and Leo begin stroking madly as the shark swims
free of the wreckage. Leo urges himself on.
LEO
Swim, swim, swim...
Murtaugh sees the lifeboat, still tied to the freighter,
drifting behind it. He swims over and climbs aboard.
Then calls to Leo, paddling frantically nearby -Leo, this way!

MURTAUGH
Over here!

Leo sees Murtaugh, alters course for the boat.
glances back. The shark's coming for him.
Agh!

Swim!

LEO
Swim!

He

Swim!

The shark closes quickly on the little guy. It's about
to nail him... when Murtaugh grabs Leo's shirt, hauls him
into the lifeboat. They tumble onto the floorboards.
LEO
You see that? Fucking shark
almost ate me.

Murtaugh stands, watches his boat sink from sight.

Beat.

MURTAUGH
Since meeting Riggs, I've had my
house destroyed, my car wrecked,
and my boat sunk... What's left?
LEO
That's pretty much it.
Murtaugh sees a "Code 7" life ring floating next to the
lifeboat. He picks it up. All that's left of his boat.
22

BACK ON FREIGHTER

22

Riggs is slowly coming around from the karate chop.
Finds his gun. Stands. There's a CREAK behind him.
Riggs spins. A hatch is opening. Riggs aims. The laser
pinpoints an old Chinese woman emerging. Behind her are
more Chinese. Other hatches open. Riggs lowers his gun,
watches, stunned, as seemingly endless numbers of ragged,
tired, and frightened Chinese men, women, and children
slowly emerge onto the deck.

EXT. BEACH - NEAR SHIP - LATER

Coast Guard, LAPD, LAFD, INS -- you name it, they're
there, plus news crews and looky-loos. The Chinese have
been corralled by INS near the boat.

Riggs, Murtaugh and an INS AGENT look down at the Chinese
herded together on the beach.
INS AGENT
Coast Guard interdicts about one
of these a month.
MURTAUGH
Raggedy-looking folks.
INS AGENT
Six weeks locked in a hold with

RIGGS
Thirty-five grand? Where'd they
get that kind of money?
INS AGENT
Didn't. Gotta work it off.
Snakeheads, the smugglers, they
sell 'em as cheap labor.
Sell 'em?
Like slaves.

MURTAUGH
INS AGENT

We see the word register with Murtaugh.
INS AGENT
Women and girls're forced into
prostitution. Rest earn seventy
cents an hour in the sweatshops.
RIGGS
They gotta work off thirty-five
G's making seventy cents an hour?
INS AGENT
Takes years. Then the debt's
gone, and the people're used up.
From work, from drugs, from
living two to a bed in some rat
hole 'til they quit caring.
RIGGS
What about these people here?
INS AGENT
They'll claim asylum, say they
were persecuted, like everybody
else. We'll end up sending 'em
back. Cost a goddamn fortune.
MURTAUGH
What happened to 'Bring me your
tired, your poor, your wretched
masses yearning to be free'?
INS AGENT
Now it reads 'no vacancies'...
You'd think word'd get back, and
they'd give us a break, but they
don't. Snakehead biz is booming.
He indicates the shot-up corpse of a Chinese man nearby.

Butters is a junior-grade detective, twenties, black.

A troubled look crosses Butters' face.
Homicide?

There's two more over the side.
Butters crosses.

That really pisses me off!
Riggs and Murtaugh exchange a look.
BUTTERS
Folks're getting killed left,
right, and center in this town!
Now we're importing victims.
Gang-bangers wanna cap each other,
no problem! Shoot it out with the
cops -- boom, you're dead, who
cares? Some poor guy just trying to
get through the shit 24-7-365, and
he's whacked, that really pisses
me off!
MURTAUGH
Easy, Biscuits.
BUTTERS

Just don't like it when people do
bad things to good folks.
RIGGS

RIGGS
I'll get a patrol car to drop me
at my truck. See you tomorrow...
Sorry about your boat, Rog. I
know it meant a lot.
They share a look. Then Riggs heads off. Murtaugh goes
to the beached lifeboat. Retrieves the "Code 7" life
ring. In doing so, leans on the tarp covering the
boat's forward half. A MUFFLED CRY. Beat. Murtaugh
lifts the tarp, revealing ten Chinese -- men, women and
children. Frightened stowaways, huddled together...

INT. BENNY CHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

UNCLE BENNY CHAN's seventies, wearing all Ralph Lauren
Polo. Sitting with Benny, slightly apart, is WAH SING
KU, thirty, discerning, full of dangerous potentials we
can only guess at right now. Dressed in Shanghai Tang,
modern clothes with classical Chinese touches, qualities
Ku possesses. Both men, plus an Uncle Benny enforcer,
YEE, have their attention focused on GEORGE PROODY, a
young State Department suit holding up a sheaf of papers.
PROODY
Four sets of papers. Totally
genuine. They'll get in the
country, and they'll be able to
stay. Forever. U.S. citizens.
He hands the papers to Benny.
PROODY
Ask 'em to vote the incumbent
party next election. Help me
keep my job with the State
Department.
UNCLE BENNY
(eyeing reports)
Bloody marvelous...
PROODY
They've red-flagged all Asian
visas lately. Those weren't easy
to slip through.

CHU

KU

What about the merchandise?
It's missing.

CHU

UNCLE BENNY
I'll find out about it immediately.
The look Ku gives Benny is shaming, and Benny feels it.
PROODY
Something wrong?
UNCLE BENNY

Small delivery problem... Thank
you, Mr. Proody.
Benny nods to Yee. Yee hands Proody a bundle of cash.
Proody scans it. He's satisfied. Beat.
Good night.

UNCLE BENNY

Proody is suddenly wary of his situation. Knows he's
vulnerable now. Knows they're killers. With an eye on the
room, he goes... After which Ku pulls a loop of Buddhist
prayer beads from a pocket and fingers them, lost in dark
meditation, while no one else speaks.

Proody can't react in time... The truck shoves him onto

The TRAIN SLAMS into Proody's car. Launches. it. The
twisted wreckage flips through the air toward the concretecontained river. Drops onto the cement bank. EXPLODES as

That's crazy.

LORNA
Of course it is. It's someone
with a grudge against him.
Probably some jerk he put away...
But with the new boats all the

private college, it's caused
conversation. Anyway, I thought
you should know. I'll tell you

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up...
Rianne's married?

To a cop. They met last year.
They fell in love. She got

What the hell're you doing here?
At which point, one of the thugs sees a red laser dot on
his nose... REVEAL Riggs, outside the back window, his
9mm in one hand, Murtaugh's ankle gun in the other. The
two thugs he has the drop on surrender their guns. The
rest follow suit. Lorna grabs a gun as Murtaugh gets
his back and draws down on Ku. Riggs enters.
RIGGS
What have we here?
MURTAUGH
They took the Hongs. And look
who's on the stairs, Uncle Benny's
friend.
Riggs moves around to see Ku.
MURTAUGH
Where the hell'd you take 'em?
A thug makes his move. Flicks open an ice-pick stiletto
as he grabs Lorna. Presses the point to her pregnant
belly. Riggs is instantly compliant.
RIGGS
Okay... Take it easy...
He drops his gun. Murtaugh drops his. The guy with the
knife relaxes... when suddenly, Lorna arch-stomps him.
Elbows him through the kitchen doorway. Slams the pocket
door on his knife arm. Takes the knife. Jams it through
the door, inches from the guy's face. And all hell
breaks loose...

Everybody's going for the pile of guns on the floor.
Riggs has three guys to contend with. Guys with good
kung fu. Riggs is at his outer limits. Kicks and
punches and bites and scratches and nut-crushes.
Murtaugh's got one guy after him. The guy's swinging a
standing lamp. Murtaugh's about to hit him with a
porcelain bowl, when Trish yells -Not the bowl.

TRISH

Murtaugh puts it down, dispatches with a body slam
against a wall.
Ku just watches from the stairs, eyes glued to Riggs as
he fights off his three. Ku seeing what kind of stuff
Riggs has, how good he is... until Riggs suddenly has a
gun in his hand. About to swing it up... when Ku drops
down through the stairwell... He can fly?... In a series
of stunning moves, Ku disarms Riggs, and sweeps up the
pistol. Pops up with it as Murtaugh pops up with his
gun, and Riggs pops up again with his own Beretta. Two
guns against one. Beat. Ku surrenders his. Another
beat. Relief... And then Ku does something truly
amazing. Fast as a bolt of lightning... reaches for
Riggs' Beretta and in a single move disassembles it.
Riggs is still holding the grip and trigger, but Ku has
the entire barrel and slide mechanism. And he's not
done... Cracks Murtaugh on the wrist with the slide and
disarms him. Next a flying scissors kick. Riggs and
Murtaugh hit the floor... It's over.
B81

INT. MURTAUGH'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

B81

Ku looks on as his men finish binding everyone. Riggs
and Murtaugh wonder whether it'll be bullets in the
head or the quiet work of the stiletto on neck arteries.
It's neither. It's worse... Ku flicks ON a BUTANE
LIGHTER. Turns the flame up high. Reaches for the
curtains, which quickly catch fire. He lights more
curtains. Papers on a desk. A lamp shade. Anything
that burns. Then barks in Chinese to two of his men.
KU
Stay with them until you're sure
they can't get out.
Ku, Yee and Chu go. The remaining two thugs stand guard
as the flames spread. Soon, the house is an inferno.
The smoke's choking. The thugs still don't budge. It
looks like they're going up in flames, too... when they
finally give each other a look, then turn and run out.

Instantly, Riggs and Murtaugh mobilize, trying to get
loose... They can't... Fire's everywhere... when a closet
door under the stairs opens, and Ping emerges. He'd been
hiding. The bad guys missed him... Ping sees everyone
tied up in the living room... His eyes go to the
children's scissors lying on the floor, where he'd been
doing paper cut-outs earlier... Grabs the scissors...
Begins cutting the tape binding Riggs... it's laborious;
the tape's strong, the small, kid's scissors not meant
for heavy-duty cutting... But slowly, the tape gives
way... And then Riggs is loose... Riggs cuts Murtaugh
free. Throws a chair through the front window. Then he
and Murtaugh move Ping and the women out, not bothering
to untie them.

Hong's uncle was an artist. Maybe

You said ancestors.
MURTAUGH
Ancestors, forefathers...

Not forefathers. Four fathers.
The number four. Top guys in one
of the old Hong Kong Triads. Reds
jailed 'em when they took over
Hong Kong. We're hearing they were
just moved outta prison.

Ku and a dozen Triad gangsters, including Fan and Chu,

The Four Fathers. All in suspended animation while a
PRC egghead operates the scanner. The scan's complete.
The egghead signals the bill's good. The General nods
to his men to release the Four Fathers... when we hear
a CAR HORN HONKING "shave and a haircut." Everyone turns
to see Riggs and Murtaugh driving in. Slowly. Butters,
Ng, and Tony following in their car. The soldiers'
automatics swinging over onto them... Riggs and Murtaugh
stop. Get out. No guns. Nonchalant.
Hi, gang.

What do you want?
Riggs hands over the faceless renminbi.
RIGGS
Need toilet paper back home?
That's all the renminbi's good
for.
As the General checks the renminbi -MURTAUGH
You can take the Four Pops back
to China. We don't give a shit.
RIGGS
Yeah, do what you want with 'em.
Just don't leave 'em here.
Whereupon the General pulls a GUN and SHOOTS two Four
Fathers in the head. Fan kills him before he SHOOTS

Hits him with a BURST... And all hell breaks loose.

The battle pits the Triad against Riggs, Murtaugh,
Butters, Ng, Tony, and the PRC Army. It rapidly
divides into separate skirmishes that sometimes
overlap. It's a war. Most important, we're counting
the bullets. The PRC guys have, at most, three thirtyfive round mags. In real life, set on full auto, that
goes fast. The Triad guys are slightly less well-armed.
Riggs, Murtaugh, et al have their pistols and a couple
extra mags each. What this means is, as people run out
of ammo, they're first diving after dead guys' guns, and
then they're going to hands and feet and whatever they
can grab to hit with or throw. The gun battle will
transform into a realistic martial arts melee.
During the fight:
Ku's goal's to protect the two remaining Four Fathers
and get them out. In the process, he takes on multiple
opponents, armed and not.
We see the two remaining Four Fathers' martial arts
skills on display.
Riggs suffers an early flesh wound.

Riggs heads off in Ku's direction.
Across the room, Murtaugh FIRES TWO of his four... when
a Triad guy he doesn't see draws a bead on him. FIRES
... And suddenly Butters is there. Knocks Murtaugh
down. Takes the bullet himself. Murtaugh comes off
the ground, POPS the shooter, and moves to Butters.
Butters.

Watch him.
Ng comes over as Murtaugh moves on. Checks the cylinder
as he goes. One bullet left... when the old Four Father
is there. Drives a kick into Murtaugh's kidneys. A
monkey fist in the neck. Murtaugh fights unconsciousness.
Sees him moving in again. Finds a paint spray gun at
hand. Sees the old man's glasses. Sprays... A pink mist
covers the lenses. The old guy has to take them off.
Losing his glasses doesn't change his kung fu -- it's as
good as ever -- it's just now all his blows're landing
half a foot short. Which Murtaugh realizes. Stays out
of range. Waits for an opening. Then clonks him with
the butt of his revolver.
Riggs FIRES his last two.

Meets Chu mano-a-mano...

Chu makes Riggs suffer... when a PRC Army guy appears
and takes Chu out... A moment of acknowledgement between
him and Riggs. Then Ku and his father end the moment.
Strike like a lightning. Ku drops Riggs as the father
kills the soldier... Ku moves to kill Riggs with a punch.
Across the room, Murtaugh sees Ku about to kill Riggs.
Raises his GUN. It's a long shot. Murtaugh pauses.
Cricks his neck. FIRES.
An instinct alerts Ku. He sees Murtaugh fire. Moves just
enough to avoid the slug... Murtaugh keeps pulling the
trigger. The hammer falling on empty chambers... Ku
senses something behind him. Turns to find his father's
taken Murtaugh's slug and bleeds profusely from the hole
it made in his pericardium. Ku moves to him. Catches him
as he falls. Supports him as he heads for a door. Finds
himself engaged by a PRC soldier. Dispatches him despite
the burden of his father's body. And exits.
Murtaugh moves to Riggs. They're both bruised and beat-up.
Exhausted. The battle's basically over. Bodies everywhere.
Murtaugh hoists Riggs to his feet.
C'mon.

EXT. NATIONAL ANSCO WAREHOUSE

Out on a fucked-up, old pier. Ku supporting his father
as he looks for an escape... when the father sags, drops
to the ground... Ku bends over him. Their eyes meet.
They hold the look for a long time... Father and son...
And then the father's eyes roll back.
A DOOR BANGS OPEN a SHORT DISTANCE AWAY. Riggs and
Murtaugh stumble out of the warehouse. See Ku kneeling
next to the body. Bowed. His brow touching his father's
... Ku lifts his head. Sees Riggs and Murtaugh... Ku has
nothing left to live for now. Nothing except to kill the
two men responsible for his failure, for his father's
death... Ku stands. Starts walking toward them. Slowly.
Inexorably.
Riggs and Murtaugh watch as Ku approaches. They're alone.
They're out of bullets. They're shot up, tired, and
generally hurting...
MURTAUGH
Since I met you, I've done a
lotta hairy shit, 'cause somebody
had to back you up. But it ain't
gonna happen now... I'm gonna be
a grandfather, and you and Lorna
are gonna have a baby... He ain't
worth dying for, Riggs.
The two men hold a long look.
IN the DISTANCE.

SIRENS APPROACH

RIGGS
... Cavalry's coming, anyway.
And this guy won't get far. We
can always track him down
sometime when we have a
howitzer... Your son-in-law's
in there. Let's get him and
get out.
Murtaugh's not a little relieved.

They turn, start off.

RIGGS
We're too old for this shit.
MURTAUGH
Guy's just too damn good.
RIGGS
Yeah, he took my gun apart, for
Christ's sake. How the hell'd

MURTAUGH
Yeah... How did he?

They keep walking... Two more steps. Then stop. Look at
each other. It's a long look. Murtaugh sighs...
MURTAUGH
Yeah, okay, let's go ask him.
They turn back. Start walking toward Ku. Ku keeps
coming... The distance closes... Then, in English!-.. No tomorrow...
And Riggs and Murtaugh charge... Ku knocks them both
down... Then they're up. And the fight's on...
What follows goes beyond what we've seen so far. Ku has
the skill; Riggs and Murtaugh have the heart and the will.
Ku's methodical; they're animal, unstructured, spitting,
tearing, howling. And taking massive punishment. When
Ku's about to deliver the death blow to Murtaugh, Riggs
intercedes. Murtaugh does the same for Riggs, barreling
into Ku. Fighting the way a grizzly fights... The
battle's nasty, brutish, and long.
Murtaugh's beaten, a mess... In the end, it's up to
Riggs. To reach deeper into himself than he already has.
To become, despite age and attrition, something he once
was. Insane. For all or zero... Twelve years melt away...
This is the kid who jumped off buildings and killed
Mr. Joshua. The demon-product of an idiotic war and dark
memories and desperation... The Lethal Weapon...
It's not that Riggs is, finally, better than Ku. He's
just switched into a gear Ku isn't expecting. Taking
punishment Ku and we would never think possible...
Driving Ku back. Unleashing all his fury... when
Murtaugh suddenly spears Ku with a piece of steel rebar.
Front to back... Ku knocks Murtaugh unconscious for it...
He'd kill Murtaugh next. If Riggs didn't grab the bar,
a hand on either end, and whip Ku around... Riggs doesn't
let go either. Grips the steel tight, uses it to maneuver
Ku and inflict massive pain... when suddenly, Ku flicks
his foot over his own shoulder and stuns Riggs. And the
two men tumble off the pier...

The odds shift back into Ku's favor again. He's nailed
Riggs with the kick and now begins to punish him underwater,
not caring if he himself dies, as long as Riggs dies,
too... when Riggs' hand finds an AK-47 inside the car
with Chu. He pulls it out. Sticks it in Ku's belly...
Ku tries to shove the barrel away... And Riggs OPENS UP
on FULL AUTO. GUN flashes light silt-stirred water.
Shell casings eject in SLO-MO through fluid resistance.
And a magazine of AK SLUGS RIP UP Ku's guts... Blood fills
the water. Ku's eyes meet Riggs'. Then his hand releases
the gun barrel. And Ku drifts to the harbor floor...
Riggs doesn't see him hit, though. He's heading topside
for oxygen.

EXT. PIER

B132

Riggs breaks the surface. Gasping for air.
To Ku, somewhere below him!--

He's won.

RIGGS
No tomorrow for you, asshole.
He swims to a ladder fixed to a piling. Grabs a rung.
Starts to hoist himself out... when Ku explodes up out of
the water. Whips the garrote in his Buddhist prayer
beads over Riggs' head and draws it tight.
The wire bites into Riggs' neck. The weight of Ku's bloody
body pulls on him. Riggs white-knuckles the rung with one
hand, tries to fight Ku off with the other... We see a
ladder begin to pull away from the rotting wood and
concrete of the pier... when Riggs finds the rebar still
sticking through Ku's side and yanks it out... The searing
pain causes Ku to loosen the garrote slightly. Enough for
Riggs to get the rebar wedged inside it. To slide the
rebar up alongside his face and begin to lever the garrote
away from his neck... Slowly, he manages to slide the wire
noose up over his head. And then, in a sudden reversal,
whips the loop off his own head and back over Ku's... The
ladder's hanging by a bolt now... Riggs tightens the
garrote around Ku's neck... As the last bolt holding the
ladder lets go, Riggs whips the garrote around a steel
hook protruding from the ladder's side, and the ladder,
still connected to a large chunk of concrete, drops into
the depths, carrying Ku with it... He won't be coming
back from that one... Whereupon Riggs reaches up for a
piece of concrete and rebar hanging off the pier. Grabs
it... And it breaks away on top of him. And Riggs, too,
is gone. Plunged to the bottom... Not coming up.
On the pier, Murtaugh comes to.

Looks around.

No one.

rebounding off the walls. But that's all. No bubbles.
When the waves disappear, it's just still black water.
Murtaugh screams now, looking down into the water.
MURTAUGH
Where are you, Riggs?!
Nothing. Moving along the edge of the dry dock now,
still calling down into the water -MURTAUGH
Tell me where you are, Riggs!...
Will it to me! Will it to me,
Riggs!... Tell me where you are,
Riggs!... Will it to me! Will
it to me!
Beat. Beat. Murtaugh's eyes suddenly swing to a spot in
the water. Like he's heard something. He runs. A few
strides along the edge. Then dives to the spot.

UNDERWATER

Murtaugh swims down... Deeper and deeper... and...
there, next to Ku's dead body and the ladder, is Riggs...
Pinned under the large chunk of concrete and steel.
Breath running out. Desperate eyes bugged, pleading with
Murtaugh... It's hopeless for Murtaugh to try and shift
such an enormous weight. Except that Murtaugh's gonna
try. Gets his hands under the concrete. Plants his feet
on the bottom of the dry dock. Lifts. Strains. Maxes
every fiber in his body. Muscles burning from oxygen
debt... until... the mass slowly begins to move ... More
and more... And then Riggs is free. Murtaugh hauls his
friend up toward the dim moonlight shimmering above them.

Riggs lays a hand on the stone. Closes his eyes... Reliving memories of the woman he'd loved and wed and
buried... Stays that way a long time. Then opens his eyes

growing up, y'know? She went,
y'know, away or whatever. And
dad was no Crackerjack prize...
Anyway, Froggy didn't turn into
anything, just stayed a frog, but
was still my best friend, and
one day I was carrying his
box in my bike basket, and he
jumped out. My back wheel ran
over him. And he died... I
was heartbroken... I'd never
love another living thing ever
again... Then, about a year
later, the mentally slow guy
in the next apartment, Iggy,
his dog has puppies, and he has
to get rid of 'em, and he asks
me to take the one that didn't
sell. So I do... Pretty soon,
it's my new best friend. I
named him Froggy the Second...
It wasn't that he was a better
pet. Just a different one...
Anyway, I thought maybe it
was relevant.
There's a long beat. After which, Leo turns, starts to go

Rows of babies in isolettes positioned near the viewing
window. The CAMERA looking out as Riggs and Leo appear
at the window. Riggs showing Leo the new arrival.
Knocks on the window to get the attention of the NURSERY
NURSE. Holds up his badge. The Nurse nods, moves to an
islolette containing a swaddled baby, its head obscured
by the blanket. She wheels the isolette to the window.
Unwraps the blanket, revealing... A BLACK BABY GIRL.
Double-takes all around... when there's a tap on Riggs'
shoulder, and he turns to see Butters and Murtaugh.
Butters holding up his badge for the nurse. And now
everybody's starting to understand the mix-up. The
nurse goes to get another isolette as we WATCH BUT
CAN'T HEAR Riggs, Butters, Murtaugh, and Leo. It's
clear Rianne's just had her baby, too. Congratulations
all around. Then the nurse wheels up the second
isolette, pulls back the blanket... and reveals RIGGS

As they all tighten up for the shot, and Leo figures

look. She hands him their daughter to hold. Butters
