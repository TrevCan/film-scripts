EXT. PLANET - DAY

SUBTITLE: THE EARTH
From space the Earth is brown and meteor-scarred. We move in
until we are on its endlessly barren and lifeless surface.
The atmosphere is hazy, toxic-looking. Volcanoes erupt.
Meteors bombard. Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools
of water. All this in silence.

INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - MORNING

*

SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CA, FOUR BILLION AND FORTY YEARS LATER
Beamed ceiling, ostentatious fireplace. A few birthday cards
on the mantel, two of them identical: "To Our Dear Son on His
Fortieth Birthday." Charlie Kaufman, a fat, balding man in a
purple sweater with tags still attached, paces. His
incantational voice-over carpets this and every scene he's
in. It is at times barely audible, but always present.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)
I'm old. I'm fat. I'm bald.
(reaches for notebook, catches
sight of bare feet)
My toenails have turned strange. I am
old. I am -(flips through notebook, paces)
I have nothing. She'll think I'm an
idiot. Why couldn't I stay on that diet?
She'll pretend not to be disappointed,
but I'll see that look, that look -(passes mirror, glances quickly
at reflection, looks away)
God, I'm repulsive.
(another glance)
But as repulsive as I think? My Body
Dysmorphic Disorder confuses everything.
I mean, I know people call me Fatty
behind my back. Or Fatso. Or,
facetiously, Slim. But I also realize
this is my own perverted form of selfaggrandizement, that no one talks about
me at all. What possible interest is an
old, bald, fat man to anyone?

BRITISH NARRATOR
As natural selection works solely by and

Suddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve.

INT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS

John Laroche, a skinny man with no front teeth, drives. The
van is piled with bags of potting soil, gardening junk. A
Writings of Charles Darwin audio cassette case is on the seat
next to Laroche.

*

BRITISH NARRATOR
It is interesting to contemplate an
entangled bank, clothed with many plants
of many kinds, with birds singing...
Laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing
by. Almost too late, he spots the Fakahatchee Strand State
Preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road
turn-off. The cassette case flies from the seat and halfburies itself in an open bag of peat.

Nirvana blasts. Russell, Vinson, and Randy, three young
Indian men, pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead.

They share a stoned laugh.

We glide over a desk piled with orchid books, past a photo of
Laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board, and come to
rest on a woman typing. It's Susan Orlean: pale, delicate
and blond. We lose ourselves in her melancholy beauty.

ORLEAN (V.O.)
I went to Florida two years ago to write
a piece for the New Yorker. It was after
reading a small article about a white man
and three Seminole men arrested with rare
orchids they'd stolen out of a place
called...

INT. RANGER'S TRUCK - MID-MORNING
Tony, a ranger, drives past the Fakahatchee Strand State
Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the white van
and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license plate on the
Ford. He pulls over down the road, whispers into his C.B.
TONY
We got Seminoles, in the swamp.
Tony waits for a response.

Nothing.

TONY (cont'd)
I repeat, Indians in the swamp.
Tony clears his throat into the radio.
RADIO VOICE
I don't know what you want me to say.
TONY
Barry, Indians do not go on swamp walks.
If there are Indians in the swamp, they
are in there for a reason.
No response. Tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches
the vehicles through binoculars. Nothing. He straightens
his cap. Mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips.

INT. L.A. BUSINESS LUNCH RESTAURANT - MIDDAY

Kaufman, wearing his purple sweater sans tags, sits with
Valerie, an attractive woman in wire-rim glasses. They pick
at salads. Kaufman steals glances at her lips, her hair, her
breasts. She looks up at him. He blanches, looks down.

*

KAUFMAN
She looked at my hairline. She thinks
I'm old. She thinks I'm fat. She --

*
*

VALERIE
We think you're great.

*

KAUFMAN
Oh, thanks, wow. That's nice to hear.
A rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead. Valerie watches
it. Kaufman sees her watching it. She sees him seeing her
watching it. She looks at her salad. He quickly swabs.

*

VALERIE
We all just loved the Malkovich script.

*

KAUFMAN
That's... I appreciate that.

*

Thank you.

VALERIE
(still looking at her salad)
Such a unique voice. Boy, I'd love to
find a portal into your brain.

KAUFMAN

VALERIE

Valerie

VALERIE (cont'd)
Good. So, tell me your thoughts on this
crazy little project of ours.

*

In one motion, Kaufman swabs his forehead and pulls a book
entitled The Orchid Thief from his bag.
KAUFMAN
First, I think it's a great book.
VALERIE
Laroche is a fun character, isn't he?
Kaufman nods, flips through the book, stalling. A photo of
author Susan Orlean smiles from the inside back cover.

*
*

KAUFMAN
Absolutely. And Orlean makes orchids so
fascinating. Plus her musings on
Florida, orchid poaching. Indians.
Great, sprawling New Yorker stuff. I'd
want to remain true to that, let the
movie exist rather than be artificially
plot driven.
VALERIE
Okay, great, great. I guess I'm not
exactly sure what that means.

*

KAUFMAN
Oh. Well... I like to let my work
evolve, so I'd want to go into it with
sort of open-ended kind of... and also
not force it into a typical movie form.

*
*
*
*

VALERIE
Oh. That sounds interesting... what
you're saying. I mean, I'm intrigued.

*

KAUFMAN
(blurting)
It's just, I don't want to ruin it by
making it a Hollywood product. Like, an
orchid heist movie or something.

KAUFMAN (cont'd)
Or changing the orchids into poppies and
turning it into a movie about drug
running. Y'know? Why can't there be a
movie simply about flowers? That's all.
VALERIE
That's what we're thinking.

Definitely.

*

KAUFMAN
Like, I don't want to cram in sex, or car
chases, or guns. Or characters learning
profound life lessons. Or growing or
coming to like each other or overcoming
obstacles to succeed in the end. Y'know?
The book isn't like that. Life isn't
like that. It just isn't. I feel very
strongly about this.

*
*

*
*

Kaufman is sweating like crazy now. Valerie is quiet. We
hear Kaufman's self-flagellating voice-over through the
silence, but we can't make out the words. Then:

*
*
*

VALERIE
I guess we thought maybe Susan Orlean and
Laroche could fall in and --

*
*

KAUFMAN
Okay, but to me -- this alienated
journalist writing about a passionate
backwoods guy and he teaches her to love-that's like... fake. I mean, it didn't
happen. It wouldn't happen.

If anyone could figure out how to do a
movie about flowers, it would be you.
I dunno.

KAUFMAN
I'd like to try.

Y'know?

You should. Jesus, somebody needs to
save us all. And it sounds exciting, to
immerse yourself in a real subject and

back of a turtle? Not you fellas

The Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots
something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He

Thanks. That's nice to hear. But I'm

to get by on quirkiness. I don't want to
fall back on weirdness the way other
writers fall back on sex and violence. I
want to think differently.

Adapting someone else's work is certainly

handsome guy ahead of him. With every fiber of his being, he
studies their interaction, the way she looks at him, the body
language. Her eyes, her lips. The guy finally leaves and
the cashier waves Kaufman over. As she rings him up, she
expresses no interest in him. He's hurt and fixates on a

So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther,
one of, what, forty in the entire world?
Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation.

They give it.

LAROCHE (cont'd)
The state couldn't successfully prosecute
him. Because he's an Indian and it's his

Alan Lerner, the tribe's lawyer, questions him.
LERNER
Finally, Mr. Laroche, what is your
experience in the area of horticulture?
LAROCHE
Okay, I've been a professional
horticulturist for twelve years. I've
owned a plant nursery of my own which was
destroyed by the hurricane. I'm a
professional plant lecturer. I've given
at least sixty lectures on the
cultivation of plants. I'm a published
author, both in magazine and book form.
I have extensive experience with orchids,
and the asexual micropropagation of
orchids under aseptic cultures.
This is

DONALD (CONT'D)
No, wait. See, he's being hunted by a
cop. And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.
He's already holding her hostage in his
creepy basement. So the cop gets
obsessed with figuring out her identity,
and in the process he falls in love with
her. Even though he's never even met
her. She becomes, like, the
unattainable, like the Holy Grail.

Donald waits, proud.

Mom called it psychologically taut.

Laroche stand there a moment. Lerner walks off. Laroche
cracks his neck. A charmingly shy Orlean approaches.

She indicates, with a small jerk of the head, that he might

hand and heads back to work. She watches him haul potted
plants, immersed in the activity, muscles straining against
his shirt. Orlean scribbles "He turns me on" on her notepad.
She just stands there.

ALICE
Well, I'm impressed.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA ORCHID SHOW - DAY

Kaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts,
past a Santa Barbara Orchid Society sign. He tries to study
the flowers. They are dull. He forces himself to look.
ORLEAN (V.O.)
... one looks like an onion, one looks
like an octopus. One looks...
Kaufman finds his attention drifting from orchids to women:
all different shapes, colors, personalities, some in subtle
clothing, some in garish clothing, all glowing.
ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
... like a school teacher, one looks like
a gymnast, one looks like a Midwestern
beauty queen, one looks like a New York
intellectual with whom you'd do the
Sunday Times crossword puzzle in bed.
One looks like that girl in high school
with creamy skin. One has eyes that
dance. One has eyes that contain the
sadness of the world.

This sequence shows the entire history of mankind from a
world sparsely populated with primitive hunter-gatherers to
today's overcrowded technological society. We see the
history of architecture, war, religion, commerce. We see
murder and procreation. We see man interacting with his
environment: farming, eating meat, admiring a view. We see
old age and birth. We see it again and again at dizzying
speed. We see Laroche as a child alone with his turtles. We
see Orlean as a child alone with her diary. We see Alice
serving food, smiling at customers. We finish on sad Kaufman
getting into his car and leaving the Santa Barbara Orchid
Show. The entire sequence takes two minutes.

Kaufman talks to the therapist.
KAUFMAN
I could tell a woman I'm a screenwriter

THERAPIST
I'm sure that's true.

KAUFMAN
But I want them to like me. The way I

some woman walking down the street. A
million women walking down the street. I
don't need to know what their jobs is. I
don't need to know them at all.

Laroche shows the flower to Orlean.

LAROCHE

Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose
twelve inches long to pollinate it.
Everyone thought he was a loon. Then,
sure enough, they found this moth with a
twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means
nose, by the way -- and -ORLEAN
I know what proboscis means.
LAROCHE
Let's not get off the subject. This
isn't a pissing contest. The point is
what's wonderful is that every one of
these flowers has a specific relationship
with the insect that pollinates it.
69

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

69

We're with an insect as it buzzes along.
LAROCHE (V.O.)
There are orchids that look exactly like
a particular insect.
It finds an orchid which it resembles. It lands on the
flower and begins rapidly jerking its abdomen.
LAROCHE (V.O.) (cont'd)
So it's attracted to the flower, like a
lover. Think about it. The insect has
no choice but to make love to that
flower. The flower insists. And this
attraction, this passion, is so much
larger than either of them. Neither
understands the significance of this
interaction. But because of it, the
world lives.

He rewinds the recorder, presses "play." As he listens, he
slowly shifts from unbridled enthusiasm to a bottomless pit
of depression.

profound process. It means you figure
out how to thrive in the world. People
can't sometimes.

Well, it's easier for plants; they have

We couldn't find one. I
wanted to turn back. But my mom said,
John, if you keep searching for something
past doubt, past hopelessness, past the
absolute certainty that you'll never find
it, there it'll be. So we walked. I had
goddamn bloody blisters on my feet. And
we found ourselves in this charred
prairie, desolate, sun blasted, y'know.
And there in the middle of it was this

McKee seems to watching him.

MCKEE (CONT'D)
God help you! It's flaccid, sloppy
writing. Any idiot can write voice-over
narration to explain the thoughts of a
character. You must present the internal
conflicts of your character in action.
Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks.
"Flaccid..." writes the guy on one side of him. "Any
idiot..." writes the guy on the other side.

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

It's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now
Kaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears
his sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly
planted on his face as he talks and talks.
MCKEE
Long speechs are antithetical to the
nature of cinema. The Greeks called it
stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of
ideas. A long speech in a script, say a
page long, requires that the camera hold
on the actor's face for a minute. Look
at the second hand on your watch as it
makes one complete rotation around the
clock face and you'll get an idea of how
intolerable that would be for an
audience. The ontology of the screen is
that it's always now and it's always
action and it's always vivid. And that's
an important point. We are not
recreating life on the screen. Writers
are not tape recorders. Have you ever
eavesdropped on people talking in a
coffee shop? Then you know how dull and
tedious real conversation is. Real
people are not interesting. There's not
a person in this world -- and I include
myself in this -- who would be
interesting enough to take as is and put
in a movie as a character.

Darwin and Aristotle and Kaufman have tea. It's silent and

table. Out of nowhere, he smashes Darwin in the back of the
head. Darwin flies face forward into the card table,
collapsing it. He turns, grabs Aristotle's foot and pulls
him down. A violent fight ensues. Kaufman can't get out of
the way, can't seem to move as the two men brutally bludgeon
each other, smash against walls leaving bloody prints.

MCKEE
The real world? The real fucking world?
First of all, if you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis, you'll bore
your audience to tears. Secondly:
Nothing happens in the world? Are you
out of your fucking mind? People are
murdered every day! There's genocide and
war and corruption! Every fucking day
somewhere in the world somebody
sacrifices his life to save someone else!
Every fucking day someone somewhere makes
a conscious decision to destroy someone
else! People find love! People lose it,
for Christ's sake! A child watches her
mother beaten to death on the steps of a
church! Someone goes hungry! Somebody
else betrays his best friend for a woman!
If you can't find that stuff in life,
then you, my friend, don't know much
about life! And why the fuck are you
taking up my precious two hours with your
movie? I don't have any use for it! I
don't have any bloody use for it!

Laroche, in close-up, descends the basement stairs. He pulls

turns it off. He reaches into the box and pulls out a gun.

Kaufman drives through a nice, suburban Miami neighborhood.
His headlights shine on Laroche's van ahead. Orlean sits
next to him, holding a gun. She skims Kaufman's screenplay.

KAUFMAN
Look, I don't care what you're doing.
I'm really just interested in orchids.

ORLEAN
Hey, here's me again!

"Isn't it ironic? You adapting my book?
My three years in Florida meditating on
my inability to experience passion
resulted in my finding it with you."
Jesus, that's sort of creepy.

You can laugh, but I didn't make that up.
That's a quote from your book.

ORLEAN
Yeah, I know, Charlie-boy. Chill. I'm
laughing at who I used to be. It's sad.
KAUFMAN
So now you learned about passion. From a
weirdo with no teeth. Bully for you.
ORLEAN
You can't learn about passion! You can
be passion. And it wasn't Johnny who
made me passion. It was orchids.

KAUFMAN
You never even cared about orchids.

ORLEAN
I lied about what happened at the end of
the book. I'll tell you the truth now.

have to kill me.

No, I do.

Laroche leads Orlean through the swamp. He spots something
on a tree, circles it, stands there awestruck. Orlean comes
around to see a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from the tree.
LAROCHE
The jewel of the Fakahatchee.
Orlean tries to feel some passion for it, can't.
ORLEAN
It's a flower. It's just a flower.

Might as well grab it, long as I'm here.

Laroche pulls a hacksaw from his bag.

Orlean doesn't even acknowledge he's talking.

pulverizing it. One of the men looks up and sees Laroche.

Orlean seems interested now.

LAROCHE
They wanted the ghost just to extract
their drug. It had been a ceremonial
thing, but the young guys, they liked to
get stoned. As I said, I always wanted
to clone it only to sell to collectors,
like I told you, but --

Orlean sits at the bar sipping a glass of champagne. The
place is empty. A female bartender chats and giggles on the
phone. Orlean tears her cocktail napkin into tiny pieces.
211H INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

211H

Orlean, a little tipsy, emerges from the elevator and heads
with some uncertainty down the generic hall, trying to
remember her room number. There's a small package outside
one door. Her name is written on it. This must be her room.

That sounds good, hon. So you think
you'll speak to him about it tomorrow?
No, you should, you should. He needs to
hear how you feel. All right then.
Yeah, Friday. Okay. You too.

Orlean hangs up, picks up the baggie, sniffs inside, puts it

She snorts a small amount, stands, tries to determine if it's
going to kill her. She feels nothing. She snorts the rest,
stands again, tries to feel something, doesn't. She sighs.
211J INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

211J

Orlean brushes her teeth, dully watches herself in the
mirror. Suddenly she becomes fixated on the white suds in
her mouth, on the wonderful sensation of bristles against
gum, on the scrubbing sound. A smile lights her face and
toothpaste dribbles down her chin. She watches her grinning
face with love. She bends in to the mirror for a better
look. She giggles. She alters the rhythm of her brushing.
She makes various shapes with her mouth to change the tone.
211K INT. HOTEL ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

211K

Orlean lies on the floor studying the carpet weave: the
texture, the colors. She's never seen anything more
beautiful. She tugs at a strand, rolls it around in her
fingers, sniffs it, sucks it.

The lights are off. Orlean leans her forehead against the
window and stares with awe out the window at the star-filled
sky. How exquisite! She cries, but not like any other
crying she's done: now it's at the beauty of the universe.
She tries to open the window for a better look, discovers it
does not open. Her frustration quickly turns to fascination
with the glass. She notices the oily imprint her forehead
left on it. She makes many forehead prints on the glass.

hangs up and dials "0."

I have a book. My guess is they were
probably introduced in several cultures
simultaneously.

Huh. Isn't it amazing to think that
socks were invented at all, let alone
several times simultaneously!

The van is parked on the beach. The back doors are open.
Orlean and Laroche make love inside on a sleeping bag. The
junk is pushed to the sides. Laroche seems clumsy, but
Orlean is enraptured: every touch sends her further into the
experience. She glances past Laroche at the moon. She sees
the moonlight reflecting off the junk in the van. Everything
glows with unearthly beauty: a coke can, a bag of soil, some
lines of the green powder spread on a trowel. Orlean looks
with love at these items, then at Laroche's straining face.
She pulls him to her and kisses him.

Yes.

ORLEAN

Kaufman drives, pale and sweaty. They pass very few cars
now. Orlean smiles, lost in her story.

worrying what people think of me and you - you're just oblivious.
DONALD
I'm not oblivious.
KAUFMAN
No, you don't understand. I say that as
a compliment. I really do.
(beat)
There was this time in high school. I
was watching you out the library window.
You were talking to Sarah Marsh.
DONALD
Oh, God. I was so in love with her.
KAUFMAN
I know. And you were flirting with her.
And she was really sweet to you.
DONALD
I remember that.
KAUFMAN
Then when you walked away, she started
making fun of you with Kim Canetti. It
was like they were laughing at me. You
didn't know at all. You seemed so happy.
I knew.

DONALD
I heard them.

KAUFMAN
How come you looked so happy?
DONALD
I loved Sarah, Charles. It was mine,
that love. I owned it. Even Sarah
didn't have the right to take it away.

DISSOLVE TO:
219

EXT. SWAMP - EARLY MORNING

219

The light is gray, pre-dawn, murky. Donald and Kaufman are
asleep. Donald awakens, looks around. The rental car is
still there, but there's no van. Donald nudges Kaufman. He
wakes, looks at Donald, who indicates the missing van.
They gone?

KAUFMAN

DONALD
I don't know. Maybe.
They quietly slog toward the road. There's no sign of
Laroche or Orlean. Donald looks back and smiles at Kaufman.
They're getting out of here. Kaufman feels a new, profound
affection for his brother. He pats Donald on the back. It's
an awkward tap, something never attempted before. Donald
gives a cheerful thumbs-up without looking back. They arrive
at the car. Donald is heading around to the passenger side
and stops dead in his tracks. Kaufman looks over to see
what's caught Donald's eye: there, sitting propped against a
tree, sleeps Laroche, his rifle on the ground next to him.
Kaufman and Donald are momentarily frozen. Then:
ORLEAN (O.S.)

John!

Kaufman and Donald whirl around to see Orlean eyeing them as
she emerges from the van parked up the road.
John!

ORLEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Laroche opens his eyes. With a groggy start he sees the
identical brothers standing before him. He instinctively
grabs for the rifle. To everyone's surprise it fires.
Donald is hit in the arm. Donald yelps.
Jesus!

KAUFMAN

Laroche is wide-eyed, doesn't know what to do. Kaufman grabs
Donald and shoves him in the driver's side door. Kaufman
gets in behind him, closes the door and searches his pockets
for keys. Laroche approaches the car. Kaufman finds the
keys, starts the car, backs wildly onto Janes Scenic Drive.

Kaufman and Donald both crane their necks to watch her recede
as they drive the swamp road. Then, from around a curve, a
ranger truck comes barreling. The vehicles collide and spin
violently around. The driver's side airbag deploys. Donald
flies through the windshield. Kaufman regains his bearings
and sees his brother halfway out the car, the front of his
body a bloody mess.

Kaufman hurries around the car to Donald, who is conscious,
but fading fast. Kaufman tries to keep him awake, at the
same time watching out for Orlean and Laroche.

*
*
*

KAUFMAN
Donald, it's gonna be okay. You're gonna
be okay. Just don't go to sleep.
Donald's eyes close.

*
*
*

Kaufman starts to sing.

*

KAUFMAN (cont'd)
Imagine me and you. I do.

*
*

DONALD AND KAUFMAN
I think about you day and night.
It's only right. To think about the one
you love...

*
*
*
*

Donald is dead. A battered-looking, dazed Mike Owen emerges
from the ranger truck, sees the two Kaufmans, is confused.
Kaufman stares at the body. Orlean approaches Mike Owen from
behind. Her mouth is open; she looks horrified, fascinated,
at the body of Donald. Mike Owen reaches into his truck and
grabs the C.B.

*
*
*
*

MIKE OWEN
We need help here. Logging road twelve.
Bad car accident. Is anyone there?
Terry? Terry, wake the hell up and --

*
*
*
*

Orlean shoots Mike Owen in the back of the head. He slumps
to the ground, leaving Orlean and Kaufman staring at each
other. Orlean's eyes well with tears. She can't look down
at Owen. As Kaufman and Orlean stare at each other, it's
obvious to both that this has gone beyond the point of no
return. Kaufman must be next. He bolts into the swamp. She
follows.

*

Johnny!

*
*

ORLEAN

Laroche, approaching from down the road, sees Kaufman running
into the woods. He angles in to cut him off.
221

EXT. SWAMP - CONTINUOUS

221

Laroche and Orlean, running from two different directions,
gain on Kaufman and limit his options. Kaufman finds himself
up against a lake. Alligators swim in it. There's nowhere
to go. Orlean and Laroche arrive, stop, heave. The three
stare at each other. Laroche walks toward Kaufman.

Laroche steps on something - An alligator: it awakens,
startled and angry, and reflexively grabs Laroche's leg. His
rifle fires at nothing. Orlean screams. The alligator
pulls Laroche to the ground and tears him apart. Kaufman
watches. Orlean turns her gun on the creature, shooting
crazily until it's dead. Laroche is dead. Orlean looks at
his body, drops her gun, stunned, then looks to Kaufman.

*

*
*
*
*

ORLEAN

You fat piece of shit! He's dead, you

You're a goddamn fat, hack! You hear me?

KAUFMAN
Shut up! Shut up! My brother's dead,
you psychotic bitch! Your book ruined my
life! You're just a lonely, old,
desperate, pathetic drug addict!

*

ORLEAN
(suddenly weeping)
Oh my God. Everything's over. I did
everything wrong. I want my life back.
I want it back before it got all fucked
up. Let me be a baby again. I want to
be new. I want to be new.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

Orlean collapses into a heap, sobbing. Kaufman watches,
suddenly feeling so much for this person, this concept turned
flesh before his eyes. The sun is rising. She glows.

*
*
*

KAUFMAN
Your writing. It helped me. Your book
didn't ruin my life at all. Okay?

*
*
*

ORLEAN
Writing's a lie. Everything is a lie.

*
*

KAUFMAN
No. I think it can touch people. Like
if it expresses how it is to be lonely,
that helps other people feel not so
lonely, maybe.

ORLEAN
I just wanted. That's all. I just
didn't want to die living the life I was
living.

KAUFMAN
You tried to find something better for
yourself. That's a good thing, Susan.

Thank you for saying that.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - DAY

224

Kaufman and his mother are putting Donald's belongings in
boxes. They look at each other from across the room.
Wordlessly, they meet in the middle and hug, both crying.
MOTHER
You should get some furniture, I think.
Yeah.

KAUFMAN
I'm going to do that, mom.

MOTHER
I worry about you, Charles.

She jumps up from her desk and runs to him, hugs him.
MARGARET (cont'd)
I'm so sorry to hear about your brother.
Thanks.

KAUFMAN
Thank you.

She look compassionately into his face. He meets her gaze.
She closes the door and brings him to the couch. They sit.

MARGARET
I was going to call when I heard, but -I don't know. Then it got to be too long

INT. CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kaufman, in the parking garage, waits in line with his
validated ticket. The attendant takes it and Kaufman pulls
onto the street. Margaret appears in front of his car,
looking a little pale. Kaufman rolls down his window.
Hey.

"We're all one thing, Lieutenant. That's what I've come
to realize. Like cells in a body. 'Cept we can't see

envy each other. Hurt each other. Hate each other.
How silly is that? A heart cell hating a lung cell."
