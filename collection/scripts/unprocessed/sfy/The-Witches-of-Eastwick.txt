SUKIE RIDGEMONT is picking zucchini in her garden. In
fact, the entire garden is overrun with this single vegetable. It looks like a jungle. And the zucchini are
huge. She carries them like logs. Finally she stops
and looks at the garden.
SUKIE

That's it. The rest of you can
rot.

Zucchini jelly. It's very good.
You'll like it.
MARY ANN
We had zucchini yesterday, too.
We had zucchini all summer.
SUKIE
I know, honey. They just keep
growing. Maybe we'll get a good
frost one of these nights and
they'll all die.

Fine, Raymond. We're doing
just fine.

RAYMOND
I wish we could afford to keep
you here full time.
JANE
I wish you could, too, Raymond. I
could use the money. Especially now.
RAYMOND
Is the divorce final yet?

Yes.

JANE
Finished. Yeah. Today. I'm a
free woman. I could really use
the job.
RAYMOND
Well, let's put our heads together.
Maybe we can work something out.
Hmm?
Very discreetly, he pats her on the behind and moves off.
Jane gives him a look.

INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DAY

18

ALEXANDRA SPOFFORD is carrying two trays filled with the
little clay dolls to her kiln which is next to her stove.
She puts the trays into the kiln and checks the temperature. (Like the houses of Jane and Sukie, Alex's house
was once nice but now suffers from Alex's economic condition which is close to poverty level.) Alex's twelveyear-old daughter, CAROL, is at the table eating her
breakfast and reading a book. She is shy, introverted
and slightly overweight.
CAROL
Are you coming today?
Alex hurries to iron a blouse and a skirt, make coffee
and toast and pack Carol's lunch -- all at the same time.
ALEX
I'll be there. I just need to
clean up and change. Answer the
phone, will you, honey?
The phone is not ringing. Nonetheless, Carol goes to
the phone -- still reading her book -- and puts her hand
over the receiver. The PHONE RINGS. She picks it up.
Hello?

No answer from Carol.

ALEX

You better get a move on.
Carol grabs her things and starts to go.
ALEX

You're the prettiest kid I ever
had.
She kisses her.

Carol goes.

Alex stops her.

leading the band as they try bravely to play the music.
They hit some real clinkers, but Felicia sings on undaunted -- and quite beautifully.
21

ANGLE - SCENE

21

Students, faculty and parents -- mostly mothers -- listening. Carol, Bobby, Mary Ann and the rest of Sukie's
children are among the students. The band comes to a
startling finish. Everyone applauds. Felicia bows.
Then she shakes hands with Jane. Jane mimes an apology
and returns to her seat. She is exhausted by the experience. Felicia is unphased by the playing of the
band. She sits down happily.

RAYMOND NEFF

22

comes forward and addresses the assembly.
RAYMOND
Well, wonderful. Thank you,
Felicia. Thank you, children.
And thank you, Miss Smart. I
can see we all have our work
cut out for us...
Jane winces. Some laughter comes from the audience.
Raymond winks at Jane. Jane looks at him with disdain.
RAYMOND
(continuing)
But seriously, welcome. As
we begin another year at Lenox
Elementary, my thoughts turn -as indeed they must -- to the
great family who founded the
town of Eastwick -- the Lenox
family. And especially Major
Ronald Northrup Lenox in whose
name our school was consecrated...

Listening to the principal with growing annoyance and
boredom. She looks out over the audience.

ALEX'S POV - JANE

Who is smiling at Alex.
27

ANGLE - PRINCIPAL

27

Who has been speaking over the above...
RAYMOND
In these days of disintegrating
values and lost mores, when our
children are exposed daily to the
hazards of divorce and separation
and families torn asunder, it is
comforting to think back to the
days...
28

ANGLE - FELICIA

Who is smiling but having trouble keeping her eyes open.
29

ANGLE - JANE

Who gazes toward the heavens. She closes her eyes and
seems to be saying something to herself.

There aren't many clouds in the sky. But the few that
are there begin to move and grow in size.

I mean it. Even Raymond Neff is

SUKIE
I know what you mean.

And congratulations.
That's right.
Yeah.

JANE

ALEX
Free at last, free at last.
SUKIE
Join the club.
They laugh and drink. A bolt of lightning seems to pass
through the room. They jump and laugh even harder. Then
Jane starts to cry. The other two embrace her.
JANE
I'm going to start all over again.
I've been doing this all day.
Don't.

INT. SUKIE'S LIVING ROOM - THREE WOMEN - NIGHT (LATER)
The women are very relaxed and a little drunk.
SUKIE
I don't know. I still feel like
I'm being unfaithful. Even if I
just think about it.
ALEX
It's been over a year since Monty
left.
I know.

SUKIE
ALEX
And he deserted you.

He left

JANE
It's still hard, though. Even with
the divorce, now. I keep telling
myself, okay, it's time to start
over again. But it's not so easy.
ALEX
Well, we're a little young yet
to just throw away the key. It's
not natural. And I don't mean
just sex. I mean, what are we
doing with ourselves? I loved
Ozzie, but I don't think he'd
want me to be in mourning for
the rest of my life, having
drinks with the girls every
Thursday night. What kind of
life is that?
JANE
But I like our Thursday nights.
It's one of the few chances we
get to just, you know, relax.

Okay, but it doesn't have to

Well, who?

JANE
SUKIE
Somebody nice. Somebody you could
like. God, it's like being a
virgin all over again.
ALEX
Somebody you could talk to.
Somebody with a brain.
JANE
Somebody you could be yourself
with. That would be a relief.
SUKIE
I think it would have to be
somebody from out of town.
JANE
Definitely. Especially
considering what's in town.
SUKIE
A stranger. That would be
interesting.
JANE
Yeah. Romantic. Foreign. A
tall dark European, traveling
under a curse.
In Eastwick?

Why not? A foreign prince,

honestly, what's the difference,
as long as it works...

EXT. LENOX HOUSE - NIGHT

CUTTING BACK AND FORTH:
SUKIE
From New York. No wife or family.
He told the people at Pearly
Realty he needed all that room
for his pianos. Apparently, he
has a lot of pianos.
ALEX
How many pianos can a man have?
SUKIE
I don't know. Do you think it's
funny? I mean, strange? I mean
... you know.
ALEX
What's his name?

That house is a landmark building.
They had no right to sell it.
CLYDE
I can't do anything about that.
FELICIA
No. You're too busy reporting the
last minutes of the horse trough

latest trip to Bermuda. And
what's going to happen to those

What birds?

Something... Something crawling
inside me. Something evil. Only
it's more than a feeling.
Something is happening, Clyde.
Clyde tries to take her hand.

Felicia pushes him away

Well, I'm glad they're selling.
MRS. BIDDLE
Yes. But they're not actually
'selling.' They sold. Just like
that.
ALEX
I don't get it.
MRS. BIDDLE
Well, darling, you know how I
adore the little creatures. So
fine. So unreal and yet, the
detail... little fingers and
little toes and little pudenda
making a bump in their dresses.
So sweet. But honestly, nobody's
even looked at them sideways for
months. And then this morning,
from absolutely nowhere, this man
appeared. So charming. Not
really handsome but... riveting.
Yes. That's the word, I was
riveted. I was looking into his
eyes and I found myself thinking
thoughts I hadn't entertained
since World War II. I think I
actually blushed. Can you imagine?
ALEX
No. Well, yes. I mean... so what
happened? He bought one.
MRS. BIDDLE
He bought all of them. Every
single one. How about that?

You don't by any chance remember
his name, do you?
MRS. BIDDLE
Yes. Of course. His name is...

Seated in an audience of about one hundred people on
folding chairs. Like the other members of the audience,
they are listening attentively. And then a sound. Like
HEAVY BREATHING. Almost inaudible at first. And then
SLIGHTLY LOUDER. Alex notices it first. She tries to
ignore it. She concentrates on the music.

ALEX
I beg your pardon?
DARYL
You see, women are in touch with
different things. That's my
opinion. I know that's not a
fashionable opinion right now,
but fuck it, I know what I see.
I see men running around, dipping
their dicks into every little
thing, trying to make things
happen. But it's women who have
the real power, isn't it? Women
are the source, the only power.
Nature. Birth. Re-birth. Cliche,
cliche. Sure. But true.
ALEX
Why are you telling me all this?
DARYL
Because you're an honest woman.
And I'm being honest with you. I
like women. I respect them. If
you want me to talk to you like
you're a dumb twit, I will. But
what's the point? You have brains,
Alex. More than brains. You have
power. And you don't even know
it, do you? Well, most women
don't.
ALEX
Were you ever married?
DARYL
Good question. You see? Brains.
The answer is no. Don't believe in
it. Good for the man. Lousy for
the woman. She suffocates. She

a block of wood.

silk bathrobe. Unself-consciously, Daryl slips out of
his clothing and into the robe -- with Fidel's assistance. Alex stands watching all this...

insensitive, selfish, egotistical,
you have no taste, a lousy sense

physically repulsive, intellectually
retarded, and morally reprehensible.
In the short time that we have been
together, you have demonstrated

No. Don't tighten up. You can

Jane is moving into a state of sexual ecstasy.

As the music finally ends. Silence except for Jane's
heavy breathing. They look at each other. Jane lets
the cello slide to the floor. It bursts into flames.
Jane pays no attention to it. She gets up. She walks
unsteadily to Daryl. And then she falls into his arms.

Jane bounces the ball in front of her, winding up in
preparation for a "killer" serve to Alex. The wind
kicks up, blowing up Jane's tennis skirt as well as the
net. Jane waits for the wind to die. Prepares for
another serve and once again the wind blows up her skirt
and the net. Jane stares daggers at Alex. The moment
the wind dies, without any preparation or ball bouncing,
Jane whips into a vicious serve.

Alex caught off guard, merely tries to protect herself

the women up with it. The women are unaware of what is
happening. Daryl is amazed. He grabs his video camera

I don't know

Well, good.
Yeah.

DARYL
That's great.

DARYL
Well, I just wanted to be sure
you were okay, make sure you
didn't have any uncontrollable
desire to see me. In case you
were really missing me and were,
you know, too embarrassed to call.
I thought it might make it easier
if I called first, then that way
you could still feel superior and
get to see me at the same time.

Where Alex's head, covered by a towel, comes INTO VIEW.
And then, Alex removes the towel. The sight is horrifying -- we are looking at an old, sick woman. The hair
is white and sparse, the skin is blotched, hanging
heavily off her cheeks and neck, the breasts are huge
and sagging. Alex sees herself in the mirror. But before she can react, the transformation continues at a
faster rate. She touches her hair and pieces of it fall
off and shed in her hands. The bones in her hands knot
and protrude under the skin. The skin changes color.
And then real disintegration begins -- as if she were a
corpse and her body were rotting. Finally she screams.
But the sound is inhuman. It is the sound of a corpse
screaming.

gropes his way toward a building. He feels his way along
the side of the building until he finds a door. He opens
it and the wind blows him into...

Daryl is as surprised as we are to see where he is. A
service was in progress until the great wind blew through
the doors. The congregation and the minister back toward
the walls. Daryl turns to face the wind. Summoning up
all his strength, he fights his way to the doors and,
gathering superhuman power, he pushes them closed. The
WIND POUNDS at the building, but for the moment, Daryl
has escaped it. He catches his breath. He is bruised
badly, his clothing is torn and shredded and he is still
hurting from the pain of the pins. Finally, he takes
in the terrified congregation. He smiles.
DARYL
Sorry... uh... having a little
trouble... having a little trouble
at home. A little domestic
situation. No need to be alarmed.
A little female trouble, that's
all. Hi. How are you?
He laughs as he moves unsteadily up the aisle. The
congregation continues to move away from him. The
minister steers people toward the back of the church.

Women. Ha. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.
He doubles over suddenly, gags, opens his mouth and a
stream of grapes comes out of it. The congregation
is amazed. Daryl recovers...

of his little mistakes? Like
earthquakes, and floods. Volcanos.
Tidal waves. Just another little
fuck-up in the divine plan. Like
cancer. Do you think women are
like that?
He gags and spits out more feathers and grapes. The WIND
ROARS outside the church. Daryl is having a harder time
recovering from these fits and attacks.
DARYL
(continuing)
What's the matter? You don't think
God makes mistakes? Sure he does.
We all make mistakes. 'Course, we
make mistakes and they call it
evil. God makes mistakes and they
call it nature. So what do you
think? Women. A mistake? Or did
he do it to us on purpose? I'd
like to know. Because if it's
a mistake, maybe we could do
something about it. Find a cure.
A vaccine. Build up the immune
system. Eat broccoli. Get a
little exercise. Maybe that's all
it would take. Twenty pushups a
day and you'll never be afflicted
with women again.
An excruciating pain pierces his brain. He grabs his
head, falls to his knees. While he's down, the congregation moves toward the doors and opens them. The wind
rushes in. The people fight their way out of the church.
