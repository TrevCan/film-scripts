But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space."

Crime is crime is crime.\" Silent Grace seeks to capture the struggle for the restoration of political status that was at the heart of prison protests in Northern Ireland  - not just by the more celebrated male prisoners - but by a smaller number of women prisoners, led by Farrell, at the Armagh Women's Prison."

Bilal (Tarik Akan) is devoted to the art of wrestling, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, who were both champions at the sport. Aside from his interest in wrestling for its own sake, Bilal has a chance to win a provincial wrestling contest and thereby bring home a considerable cash award for his efforts -- and so his days are spent in training for the event. Meanwhile, his brother and sister-in-law and their daughter have come back home after living in Germany for 12 years and are finding the adjustment to their cultural roots a bumpy ride. As long scenes of well-oiled and slippery wrestlers in action prepare viewers for Bilal's big event, the struggle of these men is reminiscent of the struggle of Bilal's family to come to grips with a world they may not be able to accept unconditionally."

As soon as she is confronted with the self-confident and ravishingly sexy Alex, her insecurity increases even more. Timo seems disinterested, a sharp contrast to the boyish excitement of Julian. But as night falls and their sexual exploration begins, we notice Timo may not be as casual as he initially seemed and Diana on the other hand contains hidden strength. And so we realize there's more to 'Swingers' than just sex. Swingers: could your relationship stand the test?"
