FADE IN:
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - TWILIGHT
A highrise in downtown L.A., framed tall against the
mountains. People stream out of the front door, leaving
work.
CUT TO:
INT. BASEMENT
In the near darkness of basement, a security guard makes
his way into an inner cellar. His flashlight finds a man
in work clothes bent over a panel, his back to the light.
Hey.

GUARD
This area's restricted.

The man doesn't look around.
face as he talks.

We can just almost see his

MAN
Yeah, I, uh, got called in ...
some of this wiring got screwed up.
GUARD
Nobody called it down to me. I'm
gonna have to see a work order.
MAN
Yeah ... Just one second...
CLOSEUP ON HIS HAND
reaches into his toolbox.
He rises, turning, and A KNIFE IS SHOVED THROUGH HIS EAR.
It is pulled back out with calm efficiency. The man turns,
wide-eyed, hand to his ear. Mouth open in silent protest.
Out of his hand drops the work order. He slumps over.
Dies.
HOWARD FISK takes off the guard's hat. Dripping knife
aside, he is an ordinary-looking man. His face is dead
calm, only his eyes betraying the sea of hate behind it.
He drags the body into a dark corner, grabbing a duffle bag
from out of the shadows. Then checking his watch, he goes
to the panel and begins making adjustments of his own. WE
PAN over to the door of the panel. It reads: ELEVATORS.
CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE TOWER - ELEVATOR BANK - 42ND FLOOR
It's the end of the day and people are waiting for the
elevator. The doors open, it's already crowded inside.
People groan, shuttle on. A YOUNG EXEC moos. A few people
laugh.
INT. ELEVATOR
The young exec's FRIEND presses the LOBBY button, even
though it's already lit. The young exec nods.
YOUNG EXEC
Thanks for pushing that, Bob. You
never know -- the light's on, but
maybe it's really broken.
FRIEND
Oh shut up.
A SWEATY MAN, 50s, overweight, presses tighter into the
corner beside his SECRETARY. Pats at his brow with a
hankie.
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
The elevator descends quickly.
ELEVATOR CABLES
Something wired to the cables, just above the elevator
car -- a slab of white putty, a black box, wires. A small
red light flashes on the black box a split second before it
EXPLODES.
THE CABLES
Whip and snap up the shaft like retreating snakes...
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
...Blackout.
VOICES
What the hell?
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
The elevator drops fast.

The voices yell.

EMERGENCY BREAKS
Pop out, dig into ratchets in the shaft walls.
shoot out. The elevator shudders to a halt.

Sparks

YOUNG EXEC
Jesus, Bob. What button did you
push?
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE BUILDING - EVENING
A car comes SCREECHING to a halt near the front of the
building, a red and blue light flashing on top. The door
is thrown open and SWAT officer JACK TRAVEN steps out from
behind the wheel almost before the car has stopped. Jack
heads straight for the entrance as HARRY TEMPLE, his older
partner gets out the other side and follows, tossing Jack
his flak jacket. Jack puts it on without ever taking his
eyes off the entrance as they make their way through police
cars, fire trucks and various uniforms. WE SEE these two
are a team, and that when they move, Jack takes the lead.
We are still TRACKING with Jack and Harry as WE SEE two
more SWAT guys emerge from another car, fall into step.
Another team joins them as they enter the:
INT. LOBBY
Just as another pair burst in through another set of doors
finally eight SWAT members all wordlessly sync, walking
with Jack and Harry until the whole unit stands in front of:
CAPTAIN HERB MCMAHON, 40s, on the PHONE...NORWOOD, his
technical assistant, looks at BLUEPRINTS with BAGWELL, a
middle-aged guy with "building maintenance supervisor" on
his worksuit.
Then McMahon hangs up the phone, addresses the group.
MCMAHON
What we have is fifteen people on
the express elevator just below
floor thirty. Included among them
is Louis Tremain, chairman of NuTech and owner of this building.
(more)

MCMAHON (cont'd)
Bomb took out the cables. Bomber
wants three million dollars, or he
blows the emergency brakes.
HARRY
What's our clock?
NORWOOD
He gave one hour, which leaves us
with twenty-three minutes exactly.
A COP
Anything else that'll stop the
elevator from falling?
JACK
The basement.
BAGWELL
That's the truth.
MCMAHON
The city is looking to avoid that
event. They're gonna release the
money.
HARRY
(not really asking)
We can't just unload the
passengers.
MCMAHON
Bomber's wired the elevator doors
and the hatch to trigger the bomb.
Which seats him in the crazy but
not stupid section.
JACK
(raises his hand,
smiles)
Harry volunteers to examine the
device.

Right.

HARRY
(glaring at Jack)

Fine.

MCMAHON
You two check it out.

OTIS
Nearest access panel's on the 32nd
floor, in the hall by storage.
MCMAHON
I want reports only. We're in a
holding pattern.
(to two others)
Worthy, Briggs. Secure the base
area. No one in or out the back.
(to others)
The rest of you confirm building
evac. Move.
HARRY
(to Otis, as McMahon
is still giving
orders)
What about the other elevators?
BAGWELL
In an emergency, all passengers
cars go to the nearest floor and
shut down.
JACK
(smiles)
Looks like we're walking.
CUT TO:
INT. STAIRWELL
COMBAT BOOTS thunder up a metal staircase.
sprint up the stairs.

Jack and Harry

CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
Blackness. Sounds of a power drill, muffled, through a
wall. A three-by-three foot metal access panel is lifted
away; light enters the shaft.

Jack and Harry crawl through and stand on top of the
elevator, Jack addressing the passengers while Harry checks
out the bomb. Jack has to raise his voice to be heard.
JACK
Ladies and gentleman, this is the
L.A.P.D.
(reactions; relief,
confusion)
There's been an elevator
malfunction. Just relax and we'll
have you out of there as soon as
possible.
Harry stands, gives Jack a significant look.
JACK
(smiling)
Am I lying?
HARRY
(into a mike at his
chin)
Confirm on the secondary device.
C4, molded to the brakes.
(to Jack)
What do you think?
JACK
You're the expert.
here.

I just work

HARRY
It's pretty solid.
JACK
Anyone we know?
HARRY
I don't recognize the work.
he's a pro.

But

MCMAHON
(voice over)
Traven, Temple. Hold position.
We're waiting to hear back from
him. Stay on idle.

Jack looks at his watch.
Shit.

JACK

HARRY
They're cutting it close.
JACK
I don't like it.
HARRY
What's to like?
We hold.

Mac said hold.

But Jack is getting real fidgety now.
watch.

He looks at his

HARRY
(to distract him)
Okay. Pop quiz, hot shot.
Uh...terrorist in a crowded room,
five pounds of dynamite. He's got
a deadman's stick; he lets go, it
blows.
JACK
How close am I?
HARRY
Twenty feet.
JACK
Taser. Put enough volts in him,
he won't let go for an hour.
HARRY
...uh, fifty feet.
JACK
Nice try.
(Alternate)
Blow me!
HARRY
Okay. Airport. Gunman with one
hostage, using her for cover.
(more)

HARRY (cont'd)
He's almost on a plane, you're a
hundred feet away.
(a moment)
Jack?
Jack is looking at the access panel. There is a moment
before he comes back to Harry's train of thought: Then:
JACK
Shoot the hostage.
What?

HARRY

JACK
Take her out of the equation. Go
for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear
shot.
HARRY
You're deeply nuts, Jack.
the hostage...

Shoot

JACK
(enough already)
This is wrong. He's gonna blow it
anyway.
Why?

HARRY

JACK
I don't know. Gut feeling.
HARRY
Well, right now Mac still outranks
your gut, so we sit.
JACK
How much do you think that
elevator weighs?
HARRY
(he's at it again)
Christ, Jack...

Jack starts out of the shaft.

Harry follows.

JACK
Maybe we can do something about
those hostages.
HARRY
We're not gonna shoot 'em, right?
CUT TO:
EXT. ROOF - DUSK
Jack bursts out of a roof access door and starts looking
for something. Harry follows him. Jack runs over to the
edge of the roof where there is a WINCH used by windowwashers. Large, heavy-duty.
JACK
No, we just take 'em out of the
equation.
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR - SAME TIME
The passengers, white with terror, fidget.
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR HOUSING SHED
Jack and Harry lug cable from the winch into the elevator
housing on the roof.
HARRY
You sure it'll hold?
JACK
(confident)
It'll hold.
(to convince himself.)
It'll hold.
Harry looks at his watch.

HARRY
Six minutes.
CUT TO:
INT. LOBBY - SAME TIME
Captain McMahon paces with his walkie talkie, talking to
the brass at city hall.
MCMAHON
We can't GET any more time! He's
not talking. We need goddamn
money NOW.
CUT TO:
INT. ANOTHER PLACE - SAME TIME
Fisk has a radio set-up, is listening in on the various
police exchanges. He suddenly hears sounds of Harry and
Jack echoing down the elevator shaft.
HARRY
Pop quiz, hot shot. Psycho rigs
an elevator to drop thirty
stories...
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
Jack is being lowered headfirst on a rope down the center
of the shaft. He holds the window-washing cable with a
hook on its end. He and Harry are speaking through their
microphones.
HARRY
...What do you do?
JACK
Something else, right?
He continues down. The elevator approaches. Jack comes to
the elevator car...He signals and Harry stops.

Jack looks leery at the C4 by his feet. Quietly secures
the hook to part of the elevator's frame.
JACK
Tell me again, Harry: why did I
take this job?
HARRY
Come on. Thirty more years of
this and you get a tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.

Cool.

JACK
(excited)

ANOTHER PLACE
Fisk listens.

What are they up to?

HOUSING SHED
Harry looks down the shaft one more time and runs out to:
EXT. ROOF
Harry runs over to the window washing winch. He flips a
switch and the winch starts pulling in the cable.
INT. SHAFT
Jack watches as the extra cable starts unspooling, pulled
up. He starts climbing for the access panel.
EXT. ROOF
The winch spools in cable.
INT. HOUSING SHED
Harry looks down at the elevator.
ANOTHER PLACE
Fisk listens, hears the winch faintly. He fingers a small
box with a plastic button and a timer counting down. Three
minutes left. We notice that the hand fingering the box is
missing its thumb.

The hand starts moving more agitatedly. Fisk's face
registers growing concern. Two minutes fifty-three seconds.
With sudden violence, he jabs the button.
INT. ELEVATOR
Jack takes one final look down. There is still a bunch of
slack cable lying on the elevator. On the bomb, a tiny red
light comes one.
Without hesitation Jack HURLS himself through the access
panel as the bomb BLOWS.
INT. ELEVATOR
The passengers SCREAM as the elevator shakes, begins to
drop.
EXT. ROOF
The cable snaps tight -INT. HOUSING SHED
-- nearly slicing Harry in two.

He dives to the floor.

THE ELEVATOR
Plummets. Comes to an abrupt stop.
the cable...

Springs slightly on

INT. LOBBY - NEAR THE ELEVATOR BANK
Everyone listening to the TWANGING of the cable echo down
the shaft.
BAGWELL
Usually they fall down now.
INT. HALL
Harry bursts in from the stairs.
HARRY
He's early!

JACK
Let's get them off.
EXT. ROOF - THE WINDOW-WASHING WINCH
The weight on the cable is starting to pull it from its
foundation. It groans and starts to crack -- can't bear
this weight for long. The wheels start to come off the
track. Then with a loud bang, the winch breaks free, flies
across the roof and comes to a stop at the door to the
elevator machine room.
INT. HALL
Jack and Harry look at each other.

And BOLT.

ANOTHER FLOOR - JACK AND HARRY
Emerge from the stairs, race over to the elevator access
panel...

Mac!

HARRY
(into mike)
We need people on 28 now!

THE WINDOW WASHING WINCH
Gives a bit more under the strain of the cable...
THE ELEVATOR
It drops a few inches.

People yell, gasp, cry.

JACK AND HARRY
Get the last screw out of another access panel. They can
see the bottom two feet of the elevator doors. With a
grunt they pry open the doors. People's feet and the
sounds of panic.
JACK/HARRY
On the floor! Hands and knees!
Let's move it!
A WOMAN lies down. Jack and Harry grab her hands, pull her
out. Then another. They pull out the CEO.

CEO
What the hell is all this?
Two more SWAT guys arrive and help pull.
THE WINCH
About to break free...
JACK AND HARRY
...Pull out two more people...
THE WINDOW WASHING WINCH
...Rips through the door frame, wedges against an ENGINE...
THE ELEVATOR
...Drops sharply. Oh God... But then it stops, now with
only the top three feet of the elevator showing.
THE CABLE
Is being held by what's left of the platform -- some slats
of splintering wood and lengths of bending metal. It's
giving way slowly, an inch at a time.
JACK AND HARRY
Now pull people up to get them out. They see the elevator
sinking, the opening closing. Two and a half feet. Two
feet. They have one woman to pull out. She's halfway...
her legs still in...
THE CABLE
Pulls free as the mass of wood and metal finally gives way.
THE ELEVATOR
Drops.
JACK AND HARRY
Pull the woman as hard as they can as the huge metal box
flies down, shooting out sparks -(CONTINUED)

HER LEGS
Sliding out as the top of the car races down on them -she's not gonna make it -ELEVATOR SHAFT
The elevator drops like a rock, trailing cable. It drops
so far that it disappears from sight. A huge sound when it
hits bottom.
INT. MAIN LOBBY
McMahon and the other SWAT and bomb guys are almost knocked
off their feet by the impact reverberating throughout the
building.
ELEVATOR DOORS
In the lobby buckle out from the air concussion.
INT. HALL
The woman, terrified, looks down at her legs. The elevator
just clipped off her high heel. Jack and Harry exchange a
look.
The other SWAT guys usher the rescued passengers to the
stairwell as Jack and Harry lean against the wall, a little
out of breath.
JACK
Is your watch slow?
HARRY
(shaking his head)
He jumped the gun. We had three
minutes.
JACK
Why does he do that?
three million.

He's blowing

HARRY
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad
long enough. It's a common
problem among middle-aged men,
although I myself -(CONTINUED)

JACK
He's here.
HARRY
He could've blown that thing from
Pacoima.
JACK
No, he knew we were up to
something. He's close by.
HARRY
He's not gonna corner himself in
the building. We evacuated anyway.
Jack does not reply, and Harry sees he's convinced.
thinks.

So he

HARRY
So he'd want to be here, but he'd
want to be mobile.
(click)
The elevators.
JACK
Passenger cars were stopped,
right? They checked 'em out.
HARRY
What about the freight elevators?
INT. BY FREIGHT ELEVATOR
They get to the freight elevator doors, pry them open.
They look down.
The freight elevator is stopped five floors below them.
They can hear movement in the elevator.
JACK
Will the mystery guest please sign
in...
jack slides down the elevator cable.
HARRY
Jack, we don't even know if -(CONTINUED)

But he's gone. After a moment's hesitation, Harry follows,
climbing down rungs.
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
Jack and Harry move down the shaft.
THE FREIGHT CAR
...as Jack arrives. Pulls his 9mm Glock and steps from the
rungs lightly onto the car. HARRY right behind him. The
car sinks slightly from their weight.
Jack points at the hatch cover on the elevator roof. Harry
nods and pulls his Glock. He and Jack kneel by the hatch
cover. Jack grabs the handle. Harry makes the countdown
hand signals. Three, two -A shotgun BLAST nearly takes their heads off, splintering
part of the hatch cover. Both men jump back. A second
shot right by Harry's foot sends him jumping away, he steps
on the hatch cover and it gives away. He falls into the
elevator, hitting his head badly.
Harry!

JACK

We HEAR Harry being knocked out by the butt end of a rifle.
INT. ELEVATOR
Fisk's finger pushes a button on a control panel.
JACK
Sprawled out as the elevator starts to rise. Another
shotgun blast takes out a plate-sized chunk right next to
him.
Jack wants to return fire, but hears Harry yelling in pain
and doesn't know where to shoot. Another blast right next
to him keeps him prone in the corner. He senses something
and looks up.
HIS P.O.V.
The elevator barrels toward the ceiling of the shaft.

JACK
With no other choice, jumps feet first through the pen
hatch.
INT. ELEVATOR
Jack comes crashing down into the elevator, lands hard.
The air is thick with shotgun smoke. The few lights not
shot out flicker. Jack looks up and is transfixed. He's
looking into...
THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN
He hears a voice out of the smoke.
FISK
I don't suppose anybody would pay
three million just for you.
Fisk chuckles. Then a loud, dull click.
The shotgun is empty.

Another click.

JACK
Brings his gun up fast.
Drop it!

JACK

The gun drops. Through smoke and flickering light, Jack
gets a good look at Howard Fisk. Fisk is calm, his arm
around the still groggy Harry. In his hand is a deadman's
stick. His coat opens enough for us to see he has sticks
of dynamite roped around his chest.
FISK
Pop quiz, hotshot. Terrorist
holding a police hostage. He's
got enough dynamite strapped to
his chest to blow the building in
half. What do you do?
INT. LOBBY
McMahon screams into his walkie talkie.

MCMAHON
I want location on those goddamn
shots! Briggs! Where is Jack and
Harry?
NORWOOD
Sir, we got movement in the
freight elevator.
McMahon looks at him, puzzled.
INT. ELEVATOR
Jack keeps steady aim at Fisk.
JACK
There's gonna be fifty cops
waiting for us in the basement.
FISK
Standard flanking deployment,
right?
Fisk opens the elevator control panel. Wires feed into a
small box Fisk has hooked up. Fisk hits a couple of
buttons.
FISK
Maybe we'll just get off on the
third floor.
INT. LOBBY
The elevator indicator light stops at the third floor.
MCMAHON
Third floor! Let's move it!
The SWAT cops run.
INT. ELEVATOR
Ding!

The elevator reaches P1.
FISK
Well, end of the line. This day
has been a real disappointment, I
don't mind saying.

JACK
Why, 'cause you didn't get to kill
everyone?
True hatred flashes in Fisk's eyes.
FISK
There'll come a time, boy, you'll
wish you never met me.
JACK
I'm pretty much there already.
Fisk starts to back up, dragging Harry with him.
FISK
See, I'm in charge here! I drop
this stick, they pick up your
friend with a sponge.
ANGLE ON HARRY
The Deadman's stick right before his eyes.
FISK
(to Harry)
Are you ready to die, friend?
Fuck you.

HARRY

FISK
(warily)
In two hundred years we've gone
from 'I regret that I have but one
life to give for my country' to
'fuck you.'
Go ahead!

HARRY
Drop the stick!

JACK
(to Harry)
Shut up!
FISK
Man, we got all the balls in the
world right here!

JACK
Give it up!
Fisk drags Harry out.

Jack doesn't know what to do.

Harry looks at Jack.

He barely mouthes the words.

HARRY
Shoot the hostage.
Jack can't move. Fisk and Harry head toward swinging doors
that lead to the garage. Jack watches, gun trained on Fisk.
Do it.

HARRY

He shifts aim and BLASTS Harry in the leg. Harry goes down
and Fisk can't take him anywhere. Almost laughing with
disbelief, Fisk lets go, starts running.
Jack starts shooting through the pipes and crates. One of
the shots grazes Fisk in the neck, spins him back to face
Jack. Even then, Fisk has this strange grin on his face.
FISK
STUMBLES through the doors.
JACK
Runs after him, reloading as he does...
THE DOORS
...Swing back and forth.

They slow.

Stop.

A HUGE EXPLOSION
Blasts out from the garage. Rips the doors from their
hinges. Lights go out. Plaster and cement flies.
JACK
Is knocked fifteen feet back into the far wall.
still.

He lies

FADE TO BLACK

INT. CITY HALL MEDAL CEREMONY - DAY
The elevator hostages and cops in attendance. Jack and
Harry stand to one side of the podium in full dress uniform
as the Mayor gives a droning speech. Harry has a cane.
MAYOR
...the dedication and bravery that
make L.A.'s finest truly her
finest. Fifteen citizens owe
their lives to this team, and
particularly the two officers we
are here to honor... Thanks to
them, the only life taken by a
terrorist's bomb was his own...
ANGLE ON JACK AND HARRY
Eyes front.

Harry quietly fumes.

HARRY
You shot me...I can't believe
it...they're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little
prick...
The Commissioner pins on Harry's medal. There is applause.
The Commissioner moves to pin on Jack's medal and we:
CUT TO:
INT. FISK'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
WE SEE the ceremony on TV, a close-up of Jack's face as the
audience applauds again, somewhat louder. PULL OUT TO
REVEAL a bank of four TVs, all showing the same shot of
Jack. The TVs are all fairly old, not fancy.
Fisk sits before the screens, stone faced.
he applauds.
CLOSE UP ON HIS HANDS
Again WE SEE it; no left thumb.

Slowly, loudly,

EXT. FISK'S HOUSE
We hear the clapping as WE SEE his house in the twilight.
A completely unremarkable suburban home, flanked by two
more just like it.
CUT TO:
INT. BAR - THAT NIGHT
The local cop dive. The cops sit clustered at a few
tables, celebrating. McMahon is standing, making a toast.
MCMAHON
Okay. Okay. Here's to harry, for
his quick thinking, his grace
under pressure and his brave and
selfless act...
Many "Here here"s.
MCMAHON
...and to Jack, for shooting
Harry, which God knows we've all
wanted to do for some time.
Laughs.

McMahon quiets them.
MCMAHON
No. Okay. You know what it is:
To the guys, for doing your job
and not getting dead. Mazeltov.

Everyone drinks.
speak.
Speech!

McMahon sits as Jack is called upon to
COPS
Jack, a toast!

Come on.

He doesn't want to, but he stands.
JACK
Okay. Um, I'd like to thank all
the little people -Many boos.

JACK
-- I'm fuzzy on names, but I know
you're all very tiny. Harry,
you're a god... Uh, I don't
know... here's to...tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.
"Here Here"s.

Everyone drinks.
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BAR - LATER
The dregs of the occasion. The few that are left are
fairly soused. McMahon and Jack are at the bar, talking.
The bartender, SANDY, pours them each a shot.
SANDY
Here you go. Thirty-fifth round
is on the house.
JACK
(to Mac)
Nobody wanted me to be a cop.
dad said if I wanted to prove
myself as a man I should sell
tires like him.
(to Sandy, re: shots)
His is bigger than mine.

My

Harry sits at the table with a few cops, including ROBIN,
a female cop. He vaguely paws at her as she stands.
HARRY
Come here. Come on, hey, sit on
my lap. Sit on my lap and do a
dance.
She fends off his hands.
ROBIN
(good naturedly)
Piss off, Harry. You're married.
I am?

HARRY

ANGLE ON JACK AND MCMAHON
MCMAHON
That's what this job is. It's
those moments when everything
compresses and it's just you and
him. That moment. Other jobs are
just typing. And that's what real
people don't understand about cops.
JACK
That we're psychotic.
MCMAHON
Yes. Well put. That was your
problem with what's-her-name.
What was her name?
JACK
(thinks a moment)
Debbie.
MCMAHON
Debbie.
(remembering)
Donna!
Oh.

JACK
Right.

ANGLE ON HARRY
Is looking at a picture of his wife in his wallet.
HARRY
This is my wife? She's gorgeous!
I'm going home! I'm gonna get
some.
He staggers up and over to Jack as McMahon heads for the
john.
HARRY
Jaaaaaack.
JACK
(imitating him)
Haaaaarry. Druuuuuunk.

HARRY
(puts his arm around
him)
Jack...You know what we are?
We're the two luckiest guys in the
world. Got the bad guy and didn't
lose any civilians.
JACK
We're good.
HARRY
(dead serious, in his
face)
We're lucky. Understand it, Jack.
We were dealing with a total
psycho; he could have blown us up
anytime. I got a bullet in me -six inches off the mark and they
give the medal to my wife.
JACK
Harry, man, we won.

We got him.

HARRY
Do you listen? I'm not gonna be
backing you up for a long while,
so you gotta start thinking.
Guts'll get you so far, and then
they'll get you killed. Luck runs
out, Jack. Sooner or later.
A moment, as Harry's words sink in. Harry's said his
piece: he pulls himself up, swaying. Jack helps him.
HARRY
I'm gonna go home and have some
sex.
JACK
Harry, you're gonna go home and
throw up.
HARRY
Well, that'll be fun too.

As they EXIT FRAME we:
CUT TO:
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING
Jack's airy Venice loft apartment. Very clean, slightly
industrial in look. A large model of a sailing boat
proudly displayed in one corner, the other corner holds a
complete entertainment center. Sports equipment is
carefully placed along one wall.
Jack wakes up lying on top of his covers, wearing shorts
and a tee shirt. He looks much the worse for wear. The TV
is on by the bed, the Today show blaring at Jack. He sits
slowly up and regards the TV with a bleary eye.
JACK
Katie...Love me, Katie. Bryant
will never respect you the way I
do.
Wincing from a hangover, he pulls on his sneakers. Gets
up, grabs some aspirin that he chews like candy, going for
the door and the CAMERA TRACKS ALONG, leading him as he
heads out...
EXT. JACK'S HOUSE
...the door and starts slowly down the street, jogging,
picking up speed, the bleariness leaving his face and we
are still leading him along as he starts sprinting, running
flat out down the sun-baked street.
CUT TO:
INT. JACK'S BATHROOM - LATER
Jack stands under a steaming hot shower, face to the water.
CUT TO:
EXT. STARBUCKS - A LITTLE LATER
Jack is exiting with a cup off coffee as BOB parks his bus
across the street and runs to the cafe.

BOB
Hey, Jack. You look like a side
order of hash.
JACK
Thanks, Bob.
VINCE
The boy was up late celebrating.
VINCE has Bob's coffee ready; they make the exchange like
clockwork.
Jack heads for his car as Bob crosses back to his bus.
BOB
Wild party, huh?
JACK
I don't remember that well. Can't
have been too great; I woke up
alone.
BOB
Yeah, well, last time I partied
like that I woke up married.
Bob hops in the bus and takes off. Jack puts his breakfast
on the top of his car as he digs for his keys.
THE BUS
explodes.
JACK
half-turns as the shock wave knocks him off his feet. Car
alarms wail. People run. The bus carcass burns, twisted
metal and flaming plastic where Bob was. Jack moves
forward on instinct, but there's nothing he can do and the
flames force him back.
As Jack stares in shock, we notice a PHONE RINGING, getting
louder as it filters into Jack's consciousness. Suddenly
it dawns on him and he turns, dreamlike, and walks to the
phone. Picks up the receiver.

FISK
What do you think, Jack? You
think if you can find all the
driver's teeth they'll give you
another medal?
Jesus...

JACK
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. FISK'S CAR
A big old American car. He has it parked a block or two
away. He speaks on a cellular.
FISK
Twenty second delay on the
Deadman's stick. I'm in the
airduct when it blows. Did you
think I wouldn't have prepared?
I spent two years setting up my
elevator job. Two years. I
invested myself in it. You
couldn't understand the commitment
I have. A child, Jack, you're a
child. You ruin a man's life's
work, and then you think you can
walk away? You got blinders on,
to the world. But I got your
attention now. Didn't I, Jack?
JACK
Why didn't you just come after me?
FISK
Oh, now you're getting a swelled
head. This is about my money, the
money I'm due, which I will get.
Three point seven million dollars.
That's was my original sum, plus
interest compounded quarterly and
expenses. None of this had to
happen, Jack. I hope you realize
that. That bus driver could have
gone home to his wife and children
tonight.
(more)

FISK (cont'd)
How long do you think it'll be
before they start worrying about
him? He's so late coming home...
JACK
(nearly losing it)
When I find you, man, I'm gonna
kill you all over.
FISK
Pop quiz, hotshot. There's a bomb
on a bus. Once the bus hits fifty
miles an hour, the bomb is armed.
If the bus drops below fifty, it
blows up. What do you do?
Jack is still lost.
FISK
What do you do?
Jack pauses, accepting the challenge.
JACK
I'd want to know what bus it was.
FISK
You think I'm going to tell you
that?
Yes.

JACK

FISK
(smiles)
Very good.
(smile vanishes)
Now there's rules, Jack; we have
to do this right. No one gets off
the bus. If you take any of the
passengers off, I will detonate
it. If I don't get my money by
11:00 a.m., there is also a timer.
Jack looks at his watch.

It's 8:05

JACK
We can't pull that money in time -ANGLE ON FISK
FISK
Focus, Jack! Your concern is the
bus. Don't try to call, you'll
find their radio is down. It's
Number 2525, running downtown from
Venice. It's at the corner of
Lincoln and Pico. Should be

MRS. KAMINO
That's okay.
She deposits the change and makes her way to the middle of
the bus. She waves to ORTIZ, a large repairman.
ANNIE
Hey, Ortiz.
Annie.

ORTIZ

She plops herself down in front of DOUG STEPHENS, an
obvious tourist.
STEPHENS
First time in L.A.?
ANNIE
No, I live here.

STEPHENS
No, I mean mine. Well, that's
just funny -- you heard me wrong.
I'm sightseeing. I hate to use
the word 'tourist', but -(holds up his map and
camera)
-- It's not like I can hide it!
ANNIE
Not really.
STEPHENS
You know, it took me three hours
just to get here from the airport.
I got so lost. L.A. is one large
place. But you live here, you
probably don't notice. I'm such
a yokel. There; I said it.
While he is saying it, Annie quickly sticks her gum on her
seat.
ANNIE
Oh! There's gum on my seat!
eew.

Oh,

She stands, points.

Gum.

ANNIE
(as if teaching him
the word)

Thus excused, she makes her way back to the front. She
sits by HELEN, a middle-aged secretary. Smiles vaguely at
her.

Can't you go over them?
EXT. FREEWAY
Jack grins.

It's going to be okay.

EXT. THE FREEWAY
A half-mile ahead, there's an accident blocking the three
right lanes. There are flames on the road and a POLICEMAN
is trying to direct traffic.

Traffic is backed-up a hundred yards from the accident and
is tunneling through the one open lane -- the far left lane.
Jack sees the bus. It is mired in the jam as well. But
it's all the way over to the left, fifty yards from Jack.
Jack pulls his car over onto the right shoulder, stops and
gets out. He hurries for the bus. It's a race against
time, as the bus is heading for the choke point, building
speed as the cars funnel through ahead of it.
Jack gets to the bus, just as it's about to go past the
accident. He runs along beside it, knocking on the bus
door.
Stop!

JACK
Open up!

MRS. KAMINO

Can you blame him?

Sam speeds up to get away from Jack as Jack retrieves the
badge.

Jack tries to get in front of the bus, but Sam doesn't slow
down, so Jack has to get out of the way.
The bus is getting away. He's running as fast as he can.
He tries to pull the rear doors. No go. The doors slip
from his grasp. He pounds futilely on the last plastic
side panel, and the bus is gone.
Jack staggers, doubles over, exhausted.
Cars honk at him, swerve around him.
Jack looks back. His car is a half mile back, still in
thick traffic, not an issue. Jack stops out in front of
the oncoming cars.
JACK

Stop!

We hear brakes screeching and a man yelling.
JAGUAR OWNER
What the fuck?
THE JAGUAR OWNER, late 20s, curses Jack from behind the
wheel of his brand new XJ-12 CONVERTIBLE. Jack flashes a
badge.

JACK
Get out of the car.

JAGUAR OWNER
Oh, Jesus, not again.

Jack pulls his gun.

Move over.

The man hesitates a second, then gets up and climbs over

The Jaguar Owner hesitates a beat, then grabs the sheet

JACK
I want you to write on the back in

He's worried. The traffic is already thickening.

Sam hears a honk and looks out the passenger door.
Jack has pulled the Jag around to that side. He's driving

Sam flips the door control.

Looks around. How to do this? He looks at the Jag's

opens the door, swings it wide. The wind tries to push it
shut but he holds it.

Steps out from behind a van right in front of the bus.

Horror.

It's too late.

Annie shuts her eyes.

Smashes into the baby carriage as the woman pushing it
jumps clear.
JACK AND ANNIE
Her eyes are shut.

She screams.

Jack can't help but look.

Hits the pavement. But then... a hundred empty soda and
beer cans explode out of it.

Jack smiles.

There's your baby.
Annie opens her eyes, looks in the sideview mirror.

The woman is running after the bus, shaking her fist,
stopping to pick up the cans.
Annie sighs with relief.
ANNIE
Looks just like you, honey.

Here at last are the patrol cars, which start up, leading
the way.

Everyone watches the streets.

After a few blocks...

Come to the on-ramp.

The bus follows when...

A GROUP OF SCHOOL KIDS
Walk blithely in front of it -- Annie is forced to SWERVE

Why aren't they in school?

This is a dead end.

There's a turn...
There is a turn. Way ahead, the first patrol car takes
it -- and nearly wipes out. Another follows, with all
attendant screeching.
ANNIE
I can't make that!
JACK
Keep left.
ANNIE
But it's -JACK
Keep left! You take it wide!
ANNIE
We're gonna tip over!

The passengers hesitate.

The passengers all scramble, squeeze in by each other.

Annie strains against the steering wheel to hold it steady.
She's losing it.
Jack grabs the wheel and pulls it with her, holding the

Annie and Jack bring the bus back into line.
Jack turns back to the passengers, smiling.

ANNIE
No... I don't buy it. This is not

are, we should be dead already.
What's this guy's deal?
JACK
(after a beat)
A while back this guy held some
people for ransom. It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.
ANNIE
Then what does this -(CONTINUED)

So what happens if you win?

No time for stunts, Traven. We

We move these people, he'll see.
Crazy not stupid, remember?
Mac accepts it, scowling.

Harry's working on finding this

Norwood leans out of the cab of the truck.
It's him.
Jack.

NORWOOD
He wants to talk to

JACK
Give him the number.
He steps into the bus, look at Sam.
JACK
How is he doing?
MRS. KAMINO
The bleeding is less, but...
Her look tells him Sam doesn't have much time.

HELEN
Are they going to help us?
STEPHENS
Sure they are. They're the
police. Hey, your taxes are
paying their salary. If we die
they gotta take a pay cut!
Helen blanches.
I mean...

Jack puts it to his ear.
INTERCUT WITH:

FISK
Jack, I think we have trust, but
it looks on the TV like you're
trying to get those passengers off
the bus.
JACK
You gotta let me have one.
FISK
Now, we went over the rules...
JACK
Come on, as an act of faith. We
got an injured man here. The
driver's been shot.
FISK
(chuckling)
Jack! Tell me you haven't been
shooting the passengers. I
thought it was customary for a
police officer to shoot the bad
men?

JACK
Hey, get in range.
FISK
No one gets off.
JACK
Come on! This guy has no time.
It'll grease the wheels with the
money men if you show a little
charity. There's still gonna be
plenty of us to kill.
FISK
Okay, son. You can try unload the
driver. Tell the wildcat behind
the wheel not to slow down,
though, or he won't get the chance
to bleed to death. And Jack...
JACK

Yeah?

FISK
Don't slip.

Ortiz, I'm gonna need your help.

Okay.

What about the rest of us?
MRS. KAMINO
You have to keep him straight or
I think the wound will tear.
JACK
(into walkie talkie)
McMahon, he's letting us unload
the driver. Pull up alongside us.
He bends over to grab Sam's feet.
JACK
(to Sam)
How're you feeling?
SAM
Like I've been shot.
Jack lifts, so does Ortiz at the head. Sam groans with
pain and Ray rushes in to support his middle. He and Ortiz
exchange a look. They walk him to the doorway.
McMahon's truck is right next to them. Jack stands on the
bottom step, yells to the SWAT guy on the truck.
JACK
We gotta keep him straight!
The SWAT guy nods. Jack inches out farther. He holds
Sam's legs with one hand and the railing with the other,
leaning out toward the truck. The pavement rushes by
underneath him. The SWAT guy grab Sam and slowly, the
exchange is made.
Jack steps back into the bus, where Mrs. Kamino is wiping
up blood.

I think he's gonna be -(CONTINUED)

Wait!

Helen suddenly leaps out of her seat and rushes to the

He punches a button on his cellular.

Explode. SWAT guys are knocked off their feet, Jack is
knocked into Annie and the bus swerves. Helen falls. Jack
grabs at her too late, the bus bumps sickeningly, as Jack
almost falls, grabbed by the lady in Catwoman's glasses.
For a moment, nothing. Jack sits back on the floor of the
bus at Annie's feet, staring at the hole that was steps.

Ortiz takes his jacket off, puts it around Mrs. Kamino's
shoulders.

MRS. KAMINO
Thanks you. I'm a little cold.

hysterical)

You do?

little attitude)
So if you have a wife and I don't,
does that mean that I'm expendable?

Jack brushes hair from her face.

ANNIE
When that bomb went off...

I know.

JACK

She shakes her head.
ANNIE
When it blew, I thought that was
it, I thought that was the bomb
and I was dead, and... when I saw
her fall under the bus, I was...
This is not an easy thing to say.
JACK
You were glad you were still alive.
ANNIE
(it's true)
Oh God, I'm sorry.
JACK
Don't be. You should be glad. We
all are. That doesn't mean you
don't care. It means you're a
human being.
ANNIE
She looked so scared...
JACK
She was scared. She was a nice
lady who didn't deserve to get
killed. But Annie, if she'd
gotten off he would have killed us
all. He's the asshole, Annie, the
guy who put us here. Remember
that. Okay?
She nods, shakily.
ANNIE
(a little embarrassed)
Do they teach you how to talk nice
to hysterical hostages in cop
school?

JACK
No, it's mostly tying square knots
and how to build fires, stuff like
that.
She smiles a little.

We should be okay for a while.

I guess they fell behind.
MCMAHON
Fuck! You're fired, everybody's

The speedometer climbs above sixty.
Jack starts toward the back of the bus. The passengers are
silent, terrified. He looks at their faces as he passes.

presents)
Put that stuff under your seat.

like large nonsequential bills in
two clear plastic bags. Unmarked.
Can you remember all that?
JACK
What are you telling me for?
FISK
I want you to help me get it
before it gets too late. I don't
like negotiators, Jack. They talk

Why do they mess with me, do they
think I'm doing this for fun?
JACK
Aren't you?

Oh, that's not fair, Jack. You

You don't know about me.

Oh, Christ.
ORTIZ
Just keep it steady.
ANNIE
Gee, thanks for the tip.
The truck slows a bit and the dolly inches closer to the
bus. Jack lies completely flat as the bus approaches.

He starts to disappear under the bus. Annie squints with
concentration. McMahon looks on, concerned. Jack looks
straight up, keeping as calm as possible as the bus covers
his head.
UNDER THE BUS
Jack inches under the bomb. He speaks (always into the
headset, until stated otherwise) to McMahon.
JACK
Okay, tell them to hold here.
He looks up at the bomb. From his P.O.V. the bomb is so
close it fills our line of vision. There are wires running
from the timer to various detonators. Also a few covered
wires of different colors sticking in one end of the timer
and out the other.
INT. POLICE STATION
HARRY
What do you see?
JACK
It's pretty standard. Timer's
looped to the remote, then feeds
out.
HARRY
Then we gotta try to bypass the
remote current with the battery.
Can you find the trip wire for the
remote?
JACK
I don't know. I got a few choices
here.
HARRY
Black and red?
JACK
And green.

HARRY
Okay. Listen. I'm guessing he's
not going to use standard copper
for the remote. Too weak. I'd
use a fiber alloy. I need you to
look at the wire.
JACK
It's covered.
I know.

HARRY
You gotta cut off the
But don't cut the wire.

Right.

JACK

HARRY
Start with the green.
He has to work slowly. He's so close to the bus he can't
look at his tools; he feels for them and brings them up to
his chest.
He palms an exacto and carefully starts scraping away at
the green plastic covering.
The bus hits a tiny...
BUMP
and Jack SLIPS, goes stock still as sweat drips down his
forehead. He looks at the knife. It has gone halfway
through the wire. Very, very slowly, he pulls it out.
He scrapes some more at the sheath, revealing a silverish
wire: not copper.
Bullseye.

JACK

HARRY
Great. Clip on the battery and
run it to the lead wire.
He palms the battery, clips one end to the silver wire with
the alligator clip. He searches out the lead wire. He
finds it, a cloud crossing his expression.

JACK
I can't bypass.

It'll fire.

HARRY
Collapsible circuit.
JACK
Yeah. Shit! This thing is
airtight.
Harry is thinking when Robin enters, moves toward him with
a printout, speaking.
ROBIN
Howard Fisk, Atlanta P.D., bomb
squad, retired to Sun Valley in
1989 when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine.
And on that last word she reaches Harry, turning the
printout for him to see and Fisk's picture stares us in the
face.
HARRY
That's out scumbag.
(into walkie talkie)
Jack, we found him!
ROBIN
We can get to his place inside of
fifteen minutes.
HARRY
Jack! Get out of there and sit
tight! We're going after the
source.
JACK
Watch your back.
Harry jumps up and they move out.
Mac!

JACK
Pull me out!

That was scraped by the claw...a piece of outer rubber
peels off and flies into the:
DOLLY WHEEL

JACK
As the dolly is almost pulled out from under him.
THE CABLE
Is running past him now, skittling over the pavement,
sparking, whipping around. And it's heading for a rear
wheel. If the cable gets pulled under the tire...
JACK
Reaches for the cable, to pull it back.

Too late.

THE CABLE
Hits the wheel and is sucked under in a flash.
JACK AND THE DOLLY
Are snapped toward the wheel.
INT. THE BUS
God!

ANNIE

STEPHENS
Did we hit him? What happened?
RAY
He's not behind us!
Annie and Ortiz look at each other.

They're dragging him.

Ortiz RACES for the center panel, starts unscrewing it.

MCMAHON'S AIRPORT VEHICLE
moves alongside the bus. McMahon tries to see what's
happening to Jack. He looks pretty concerned.
UNDER THE BUS
Jack tries to get a grip on the undercarriage, but his
fingers can't find purchase. So he grabs the screwdriver
and stabs it up into the undercarriage. It digs in. He
stops, and the dolly is yanked out from under him.
THE DOLLY
Hits the rear wheel, is pulled under and destroyed.
JACK
holds onto the screwdriver. Liquid sprays down on him. He
coughs, reaches out, grabs a hydraulic line and pulls
himself away from the spray. His shoes skid over pavement
at 50 m.p.h. Jack looks around, sees light coming from the
hole in the floor, three feet away. He reaches for the
hole. He can't make it.
Hey!

Ortiz sticks his head down.

Oddly enough, he is smiling.

ORTIZ

JACK
That's very... gross, Ortiz.
He goes over to Annie.
ORTIZ

ANNIE

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE
Harry and the others pull up quietly across the street. He
and Robin emerge from his car, two other SWAT guys from the
second car. One is SWAT Cop#1. They go to the front of
the house in standard formation. They stop at the windows
by the garage. The venetian blinds are still down -- can't
see in.
Harry motions for two to go around the back.
Robin around the side.

He takes

There is a door here. Robin is about to try the knob but
Harry GRABS her hand, shakes his head. He motions for her
to go around the back, which she does.
He tries the window and it gives. It's clean, no wires.
Harry goes in first. He climbs slowly, pulling his wounded
leg in. He gets in.
INT. HOUSE
Harry is in the living room, heading for the garage. WE
SEE Robin come silently in through a back window, motion
for the other two to wait outside. She and Harry both
start converging on the garage, looking around them, guns
raised.
Harry looks down at his leg just as it trips an electric
eye in the doorway.
THE ELECTRIC EYE
is wired to something.

A red light goes on.

Harry and Robin look at each other, knowing it's the last
thing they will ever see.

EXT. HOUSE
The explosion blasts out the windows, sending the other two
flying, wounded. The last thing WE SEE are the venetian

hammy to me, building the bomb
from my previous retirement gift.
But I figured a sign that said
'I'm Howard Fisk' would be pushing
it.
As he speaks, he opens the venetian blinds. We look out on
Pershing Square: he was never in the house at all.
JACK
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine
out, I swear to God.
FISK
You'll do as you're told! Now
Harry's gone. Just accept it.

FISK (cont'd)
Jack, we both know he was the
brains of your particular
operation. You're not gonna beat
me. You're gonna pay me all of my
dollars. Otherwise you, the
wildcat and every innocent soul on
that bus is gonna end up just like
your friend. Now pay attention!
Are you listening?

Yes.

JACK

FISK
Good. Tell them the drop point is

He hangs up. Jack SMASHES the phone against a pole,
furious. Everybody stares at him. He leans against the
front window., seething.

He throws the remains of the phone to the floor, unable to
respond.
ANNIE

He whips his head around, stares at her.

solution.
He still stares, but she's drawn the fire out. Everybody
is staring at him. He smiles winningly at Annie.
JACK
We're gonna die.
ANNIE
We got this far.
He falls silent again. His gaze goes from her face to her
shirt, the Arizona tee shirt. For a moment he looks almost
puzzled.
ANGLE ON THE SHIRT
Beneath the Arizona is a picture of a wildcat.
JACK
I'll be damned.
Jack kneels by her, daubing her brow, speaking softly.
JACK
You go to University of Arizona?

Yeah.

ANNIE
(puzzled)

JACK
Good football team.
Yeah...

ANNIE

JACK
Arizona Wildcats. They went nine
straight wins last year.

Right.

ANNIE

Jack smiles.
JACK
He can see you.
She starts to ask but he shushes her, standing and leaning
again on the windshield. Slowly he looks around at the
front of the bus. His P.O.V. searches for it, and there it
is, behind the big convex mirror with a view of the whole
bus. The thin wires, the red light. A camera. We push in
on it -INT. FISK'S ROOM
...and pull out, looking at the camera's P.O.V. on a small
black and white screen next to Fisk's other TVs. We pull
out further to see Fisk as his eyes flit from screen to
screen, resting on the black and white image.
On the screen, Jack kneels once again by Annie.

Maybe I better hold this after
all. I'm afraid you're a little
hysterical and might let go a mite
early. It's not 'cause you're a
woman.
He heads for the back and almost sees Jack. With nowhere
to go, Jack climbs on the top of the car. Fisk looks out
at the other cars.
FISK
Looks like we're all alone.
Nobody wanted this train.
ANNIE
You can let me go. You won, you
beat Jack, you beat everyone.
Throw me off the train, I don't
care. Only let me go.
He speaks to her softly.
FISK
This stick works on a remote.
See, when you explode, that's
where they'll come. But it's not
where I'll be. Mess like that,
they don't even count the body
parts. Gives me time.
He brushes hair from her face.

FISK
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.
ON TOP OF TRAIN
Pipes and concrete ceiling whips by Jack's head. He checks
his gun and a red conduit pipe RIPS it from his fingers.
INT. THE CAR
Fisk and Annie HEAR the gun bouncing off the top of the
car. Fisk looks up, smiles a little wildly.
FISK
Is that you, Jack?
(to Annie)
He's persistent. He always gets
his man.
He grabs the bag of money, opens it.

Looks up again.

FISK
Don't suppose you'd be interested
in a bribe, would you?
(chuckles)
Got plenty to go around...
Inside the bag, a dye pack explodes.
Fisk looks down at his now useless money, some of the dye
dripping like blue shadows on his face. He SCREAMS.
Still roaring, Fisk whips out his gun and pumps a round
into the ceiling.
TOP OF THE TRAIN
Fisk's bullets come up all around Jack, the last one
ripping into his arm. He clutches it, in agony.
IN THE TRAIN
Fisk keeps firing until the gun clicks repeatedly.
then, it's hard for him to stop.

Even

ON TOP OF THE TRAIN
No more shots -- Fisk must be out of bullets.
inching for the back of the car.

Jack starts

Fisk is right behind him.
Unchecked fury mars his face more than the eerie dye. All
semblance of control is gone. Roaring, he SLAMS his fist
into Jack's face.
He practically foaming at the mouth, hitting Jack with the
hand that holds the deadman's stick. Jack is helpless;
he's wounded and Fisk has the stick. He feebly tries to
defend himself.
Fisk is on his knees over Jack. He starts hitting Jack in
his arm wound. Jack nearly blacks out from pain.
FISK
What do you do, Jack? What do you
do? You're so smart! Right,
Jack? You little piece of shit!
I got the plan! I'm smarter than
you! I'm smarter than you!
JACK'S P.O.V.
Blurred, shifting. There is light on the ceiling.
tearing through another station.

They're

Jack suddenly pulls back his leg and SLAMS it into Fisk's
solar plexus. Fisk flies back, standing straight up on his
knees and:
A RED CONDUIT PIPE
meets his face.
SOMETHING ROUND
Bounces along the top of the train like a tin can discarded
along a freeway...
FISK'S HAND
clenched in a literal death grip over the stick...it starts
to loosen...

...and Jack GRABS the hand at the last second, closing it,
taking the stick before Fisk's body even hits the top of
the train. Jack holds the stick, out of breath.
JACK
Yeah, well, I'm taller.
INT. TRAIN
Annie turns warily at the sound of a door sliding open.
Relief. It's Jack.
Fisk?

ANNIE

By way of reply, he holds the deadman's stick up, almost
smiling. Annie looks very relieved.
JACK
I ripped his head off.
He takes off her vest and defuses the C-4 and neutralizes
the deadman stick. Goes to the driver's compartment.
INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
Sparks. The equipment was shot to shit. Jack sees the
braking controls, flips the switches. Nothing. Grabs the
speed dial/lever and tries to pull it back toward the left,
but it won't budge. It's jammed up. Pushes it forward -the train goes FASTER. Tries the radio mike -- DEAD.
JACK
RUNS back into the passenger compartment.
JACK
C'mon, we gotta jump.
She shows him her handcuffs.
Shit!

JACK

ANNIE
You can't stop it?

He pulls at the hand cuffs, pulls at her wrists, tries to
unscrew the pole with a knife -- nothing.
THE TRAIN
barrels down the tunnel.
JACK
Goes apeshit. He kicks the pole, screaming with effort.
Again. Again. Pulls at it. Pulls at her till her wrists
bleed.
ANNIE
NoooooOOOWW!
He stops.

Her eyes are wet.
ANNIE
Jack, you have to get off.

No way. He looks up at the map.
dead end.

There's a big curve, then

ANNIE
Jack, listen to me...the end of
this line is solid rock. You have
to jump. Goddamnit, I'm ordering
you! Go!
He looks at her.
Faster.
Jack...

JACK
ANNIE

Going to the driver's compartment.
JACK
The only way to stop this thing is
to make it go faster. There's a
curve up ahead. We go fast enough
we might jump the track, hit
something besides a dead end.

INT. THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
Turns the knob hard right, comes back out...
ANNIE
This is bullshit, Jack. You have
to get off this train, Jack! Jack!
He says nothing. Comes up to the pole she's at, holds on.
Braces himself. She falls silent as well. Drops her cuffs
around him. Holds him tight. They wait.
The train ROARS along the track...
INT. HIGHLAND STATION
Still under construction. At the end of the station the
track dead-ends into a ROCKFACE.
JACK AND ANNIE
brace themselves...
JACK
C'mon...Let's go...
EXT. THE TRAIN
Barreling through the station... it's going way too fast,
but it's holding the tracks.
JACK AND ANNIE
Jarred by the rough ride. The lights flicker on and off.
Smoke from overheated engines rises into the car.
INT. TUNNEL
The construction crews are fleeing.

A truck speeds off up

THE TRAIN
Hits the curve.
SCREECH.

The train wheels SPARK on the rails,

JACK AND ANNIE
Eyes shut, holding tight.

THE TRAIN
With Jack and Annie skids sideways up the ramp... Steel
SHEARS the car in half... The front half continues to skid
and roll up the ramp and...
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - THE TRAIN
...appears. Above ground, like a breaching whale, skidding
and crashing and finally resting on its side in front of
the Chinese Theater, to the amazement of dazzled onlookers.
Jack and Annie visible through the now-open back of the car.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAIN
Jack and Annie sit up, find they are all right. The pole
has been wrenched from the ceiling and Jack pulls Annie's
hands free. They suddenly kiss, desperately alive.
ANNIE
You didn't leave me...
(looks him in the eye)
You didn't leave.
(holds him again)
My God...
JACK
I didn't have to be anywhere just
then.
ANNIE
How boring?
What?

JACK

ANNIE
How boring are you?
really scary?

I mean, is it

JACK
(thinks a moment)
I watch bowling on TV.
Okay.

ANNIE

JACK
Sometimes when I watch bowling, I
get excited and I cheer.
Ooh.

ANNIE
Well...

JACK
Annie, it's over.

You can walk

She takes his hand, quickly and gentle clicks the other
cuff on him, joining them.

Whatever you say, Ma'am...
And they sit awhile.
