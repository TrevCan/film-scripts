DECEPTIONS

FADE IN:
Begin Credits:
EXTERIOR AN L.A. STREET - NIGHT
A beat-up, egg-shell Porsche brakes at a stop light beside an
immaculate red Ferrari.
INSIDE THE PORSCHE
is PETE GENTRY. He's give-a-damn good-looking, maybe 33,
well-built. There is something special about Gentry. Maybe
it's the careless way he holds the wheel. Maybe it's the
scratched-up leather jacket or the haircut one week past
neat. Or maybe it's something secret and hidden and waiting
to explode. Whatever it is, it's there in spades.
Gentry's vision trails over to the car idling beside him, a
red Ferrari. Gentry casually takes in the car, then the
driver, a silk-and-designer-jeans Hollywood type, who first
recognizes Gentry's existence with an expression of disdain,
then a grin of anticipation. Gentry returns his eyes to the
stop light before gently easing the ancient Porsche into
first. A race.
Moments pass. Light still red. More moments. Green light.
The Ferrari roars off the line ahead of the Porsche. Gentry
corrects an early fish-tail, shifts into second. Third. The
cars are bumper-and-bumper. Fourth. Porsche pulling ahead.
Fifth.

The Ferrari is falling behind.

Shitty driver.

The Ferrari brakes and executes a sharp left in shame.
powering forward, Gentry grins.

Still

A moment later an LAPD black-and-white pulls in behind him.
INT. MOVING BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT
Two cops, VET and ROOKIE.
VET
Okay, let's take him.
Lights and siren go on.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

INT./EXT. GENTRY'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Gentry sees the black-and-white's flashing lights behind him.
He reaches over, removes a small detachable roof lamp from
the glove compartment and plugs it in.
INT. MOVING BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT
Vet and Rookie watch as Gentry's flashing detachable lamp is
secured to the top of his Porsche via a magnet base. The
Porsche accelerates away.
Hey!

ROOKIE

But Vet has already shut off the black-and-white's siren and
flashing roof lights.
ROOKIE
He's getting away!
VET
I've seen that kind of action
before. He's a hot-shot detective.
Probably vice or homicide. And
he'd love us to pull him over. I
won't give him the pleasure.
End credits.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. TRANCAS BEACH - DAY
An hour after sunrise. A lonely jogger pounds up the sand.
A moment after sand has stopped cascading into his
footprints, a woman walks from the sea. Her beauty is
arresting and uncalculated. ADRIENNE.
Nearby, a house, a cool two million five if it's a dime. A
huge two-story window fronts the sea, and below, a deck and
exterior staircase. Retrieving a towel from the sand,
Adrienne makes for the house.
INT. ERICKSEN LIVING ROOM - DAY
Adrienne lets herself in via the sliding door. The place is
chic and expensive. She ascends the steps to the second
floor.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

INT. ERICKSEN HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
DOUGLAS ERICKSEN, 40, a self-made man whose single pretense
is that he has none, tosses a leather suitcase onto the bed.
Bare-chested, he intends to pack and dress at the same time.
Adrienne enters and moves for the bathroom, unsnapping and
removing the bikini top as she goes.
Douglas pulls on a beige business shirt, buttons the front,
starts on the cuffs when Adrienne, wearing nothing but a
towel bunched in front of her, steps into the doorway.
Douglas?

ADRIENNE

Adrienne smiles alluringly. She is the most beautiful,
naked, juicy woman imaginable. But Douglas is a tough guy.
DOUGLAS
(reluctantly)
You'll make me late for my plane.
ADRIENNE
Then hurry home.
Yes.

He will.

EXT. ERICKSEN DRIVEWAY - DAY
Douglas places his bags in the trunk of his Mercedes.
Adrienne watches nearby. He stops at the car door and looks
at her a long moment before:
Tomorrow.

DOUGLAS

Douglas pulls her into an embrace. Gentle, he nonetheless
lifts her up to meet him. Their lips linger before:
Tomorrow.

ADRIENNE

Douglas slides behind the wheel and a moment later the
Mercedes backs out of the driveway and motors south.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ERICKSEN HOUSE DECK - NIGHT
Adrienne leans against the rail nursing a drink.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

The wash of the sea is an endless noise. Up and down Trancas
Beach few house lights are lit. She could be the only person
for miles.
Finishing the drink, Adrienne gives the night one final look
before entering the house.
INT. ERICKSEN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Adrienne slides the door closed and locks it.
A moment later she checks the front door.

It's locked too.

A moment after that, she stops at the staircase long enough
to shut off the television with the remote before tossing it
to the couch and ascending the steps.
INT. ERICKSEN BEDROOM - NIGHT
Adrienne slips beneath the covers, then reaches for the
bedside lamp. An instant later her eyes are high-lighted by
moonlight sliced by blinds. She closes her eyes. An effort.
SOME TIME LATER
Adrienne jerks at an almost imperceptible noise from below.
She reaches for the bedside lamp, then reconsiders. Rising
from the bed, she grabs a robe, pulls it on, and then stands
perfectly still, listening.
Nothing.
She is almost ready to dismiss the whole thing when she hears
a noise. Distantly. From below.
Adrienne tip-toes to the door, turns the knob, slowly pulls
it open. It starts to creak. She freezes. Shit! Nudging
it open but a little, the door creaks again. No escaping the
noise, Adrienne gently opens the door wide enough to slip
through.
HALLWAY AND STAIRS - ADRIENNE
opens a hallway cabinet, withdraws a flashlight but does not
turn it on. She stands perfectly still, listening. Nothing.
She tip-toes to the stairs, begins to descend.
A thud followed by the sound of shattering porcelain.
Adrienne freezes and listens, but hears nothing. Pounding
heart. Blood pulsating through her veins. Someone could be
down there.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

The flashlight beam flits out and down the staircase, making
ordinary reality out of the darkness far below: A chair leg.
The drapes. A painting. Moments later:
ADRIENNE
Is there someone there?
Another noise. Close. Near the bottom of the stairs.
Adrienne gasps, then whips the heavy flashlight around,
swinging it from place to place. The shafting beam catches
nothing.
Adrienne steels herself and descends.
LIVING ROOM - ADRIENNE
reaches floor-level and sweeps the light across the mass of
oblong shapes that briefly become her furniture before again
being swallowed by darkness.
She advances to the sliding glass door, checks that it is
locked again, then turns. As she does, the flashlight
catches something slashing toward her! She jumps back...
only to discover that it's a shadow created by the flashlight
in her hand. Adrienne calms herself -- before a noise
wrenches her around. She swings the light.
ADRIENNE
Who's there? Who's there?!
Something leaps from the darkness and lands nearby. Adrienne
brings the beam to bear on... Buttermilk, her startled
Siamese cat, whose diamond eyes glow in the dark.
Sagging, Adrienne laughs at her own fright. She reaches out
to the animal and it gladly moves into her arms. As she pets
the cat:
ADRIENNE
Buttermilk! Jesus!
scared me to death!

You nearly

Behind Adrienne is a glass wall before the ocean. The face,
then torso of a man rises from the beach and approaches.
Adrienne moves away, still petting the cat.
ADRIENNE
If you broke any of my china,
that's it for you, kid.
She turns around just as the intruder drops out of sight.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

ADRIENNE
(Buttermilk)
Do you hear, hmmm? Do you hear?
Turning again, Adrienne cannot see the intruder approach the
glass. His face looks gruesome, as if melted in a fire.
Then it becomes clear. He's wearing a stocking.
Adrienne cuddles Buttermilk to her cheek lovingly.
on this animal.

She dotes

At the window now, the intruder's face presses against the
glass. He stares down at her. His gloved hands flex in
anticipation.
ADRIENNE
Let's put us to bed, hm?
Adrienne stands. Buttermilk sees the intruder and howls in
fright before clawing Adrienne in its desire for flight.
Adrienne releases Buttermilk.
ADRIENNE
Ow! Buttermilk! What's wrong with
you?!
She turns and sees the intruder beyond the glass.
screams.

Adrienne

The intruder picks up a deck chair and throws it through the
window, which shatters into a thousand splinters.
Adrienne retreats to the stairs as the intruder leaps through
the gaping hole in the glass and pursues.
No!

No!

STAIRS & HALLWAY

ADRIENNE
NNNnnnooooooo!

- ADRIENNE & THE INTRUDER

One gloved hand grabs her ankle. Another draws the blade
whose jagged edge glints from some unknown light. Adrienne
kicks, crawling backward up the stairs, before throwing the
heavy flashlight, catching the intruder in the face. A
second is bought and Adrienne spends it separating herself -two feet, three, four -- from the intruder before spinning to
run. But his hands grope for her, missing her heels by
inches as she ascends the stairs.
Adrienne hears the intruder's foot-fall behind her as she
reaches the bedroom doorway and through, slamming the door
behind her.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Adrienne locks the door and retreats a step as something -someone -- slams into it.
ADRIENNE
No! No! I'll give you money!
Just go away! Please go away!
The sound changes.
a boot.

Before a shoulder blow, now it is made by

Adrienne flinches each time the noise impacts and retreats
behind the bed. She grabs the phone. No dial tone.
Adrienne lurches for something in the darkness as the jamb
begins to splinter. An instant later the intruder bursts
through the door and leaps at her. Adrienne spins and flees
as the intruder's blade seeks her flesh.
Suddenly a BANG! and a brilliant burst of light. Another.
Another. Muzzle flashes capture the intruder in a sequence
of still-lifes as he's thrown back across the room. Six
portraits. Then darkness.
Adrienne lies sobbing on the floor.
MOMENTS LATER
Adrienne crawls to a wall switch and light fills the room.
She stands, finally, and looks at the hooded man who lies in
a pool of his own blood across the room.
Adrienne approaches the body and leans close. Her hand
reaches out and pauses inches from the stocking. Then in a
brief, brave instant she yanks the mask clear, exposing the
dead face of:
Her husband.

Douglas Ericksen!
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ERICKSEN BEDROOM - NIGHT
Adrienne, her face tear-streaked, sits in a chair across the
room from the body, which is now being loaded onto a gurney
by two white-coated attendants. Several uniformed LAPD
officers stand nearby talking casually.
Closer, a man sits on the bed near Adrienne. The beat-up
Porsche driver. LAPD Detective Sergeant Pete Gentry.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

What then?

GENTRY

But Adrienne has lapsed into never-never land.

Gently:

GENTRY
What did you do after you
discovered it was your husband?
Just outside the bedroom door, DETECTIVE LEON KESSLER, 55, a
burly knot of a man wearing more traditional cop clothes, a
wrinkled sport combo and tie, finishes taking a statement
from JOANNE PETERS, an attractive woman Adrienne's age, and
enters the room jotting notes down on a small spiral-bound
tablet.
ADRIENNE
I... went downstairs, but that
phone isn't working either.
(stops; almost loses
control)
Then I ran I ran to Joanne Peters
house. It's the next one down the
beach.
GENTRY
(gently)
Mrs. Ericksen, did you have any
idea that your husband wanted to
kill you?
The very mention of it almost makes her reject it.
ADRIENNE
No! I love... loved him.
thought he loved me.

Then:

She can't deny a look at the sheet-covered body of her dead
husband as it's wheeled out of the room. Then she buries her
head in her hands and sobs gently. Gentry, obviously
sympathetic, is helpless.
Leon sits down on the bed.

Adrienne bobs, adjusting to his

LEON
Mrs. Ericksen, I gotta be honest
with you. Something bothers me
here. You say your husband left on
a business trip to San Francisco
this morning. Then he comes back
here tonight, breaks in, and tries
to murder you with a knife.

LEON (cont'd)
And yet he forgets that he left his
.357 Magnum revolver in the bedside
table drawer. That seems... what,
Pete? Inconsistent?
ADRIENNE
What are you implying?
LEON
I'm not implying anything, lady.
All I'm trying to say is...
ADRIENNE
You're saying I wanted to kill my
husband? You're saying -(more hysterical)

He reaches out,

GENTRY
Mrs. Ericksen, it's okay! We can
continue this tomorrow when...
(another angry look at
Leon)
when you're feeling up to it.
But Adrienne cannot hold back the torrent of rage, pain and
tears.
ADRIENNE
Well, let me tell you, Officer, my
husband didn't know it was there!
It was in the shop being repaired.
I picked it up last week and forgot
to tell him about it!
Joanne Peters, seeing Adrienne's mental state from the
doorway, enters the room and rushes to Adrienne's side.
JOANNE
Addie, are you okay?
Joanne wraps her in protective arms, trying to calm her.
ADRIENNE
(reality sinking in)
Forgot... Forgot to tell him...
Forgot...
Adrienne collapses into sobs. Joanne's angry stare sears
into Gentry a moment before he turns to Leon and gestures,
Outside. Leon sighs and exits as Gentry rises:

GENTRY
Nice going, Leon.
LEON
I'm not in the comfort business.
I'm in the truth business.
GENTRY
You're not going to gain anything
by turning her into a hostile
witness.
LEON
If she's guilty, she's already
hostile. Just ask her husband.
He glares at Gentry. Gentry glares back. Then he grins.
These guys have been sparring for years. There's a facetious
cynicism to their banter.
GENTRY
So what do you think?
LEON
I think she did it.
GENTRY
You think everybody did it.
LEON
Everybody did do it.

They just

GENTRY
Got it figured, huh?
LEON
Well, I dunno, Pete. Maybe he left
the gun in the drawer because he
was fair-minded and wanted to give
her a fighting chance. What do you
think?
GENTRY
I think I'll keep an open mind.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

LEON
You gotta watch that. Who knows
what'll blow through there.
EXT. ERICKSEN HOUSE WALKWAY - NIGHT
Gentry and Leon exit and move for the side of the house. Two
neighbors are busy pounding a sheet of plywood over the hole
made by the intruder. Farther along the side of the house, a
wire junction box.
LEON
Here's where the wires were cut.
All of the various lines come into
the house at this point. Cable.
Security. Phone.
He knew which
ones to cut. Hell, it was his
house, wasn't it?
Severed wires hang from the junction box.
GENTRY
Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I thought
you said she did it? Now you're
telling me the husband planned the
whole thing?
LEON
I'm not telling you anything. But
ask yourself one question. That
girl's a walking wet-dream. Why
would anyone want to put an end to
something that sweet?
GENTRY
You're right. She's too pretty to
be innocent. Let's fry her.
LEON
Okay. You've got my opinion. So
what's yours? Really.
GENTRY
I think she's one hot-looking woman
with a lot of money and a lot of
time to enjoy it.
(grin)
Just my type.
LEON
She's your type, all right.

EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT
Gentry follows Leon out the rear gate. Leon moves for his
unmarked police cruiser and a moment later its engine fires.
Leon throws Gentry a wave and backs the car out.
Gentry stops beside his Porsche and digs for the keys.
Something captures his attention:
A large window in the Ericksen guest bedroom. Adrienne stops
and stares off into space. A moment later she removes the
robe and stands nude and beautiful before the glass.
Finally, she moves away.
Gentry stands frozen, unable to move.

Adrienne.

EXT./INT. THE EGG-SHELL PORSCHE - NIGHT
Ride with Gentry as he steers the Porsche southward on The
Coast Highway toward the city. Gentry pushes the car faster
and faster. Thoughts. Thoughts on his mind.
EXT. GENTRY'S BUILDING - NIGHT
Gentry steers the Porsche into his normal "spot" near the
entrance to the three-story building, exits, moves for the
front door.
INT. GENTRY'S BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT
Gentry has his key in the lock when the door to the next
apartment opens and LINDA, 26 and a looker, leans out.
Seeing it's Gentry, she slips out into the hall. A short
robe conceals almost nothing.
LINDA
(whispering)
Pete...
GENTRY
What are you doing here?

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

LINDA
I got back into town early. Our
radar went haywire over Denver and
we're on the ground 'til it's
fixed.
Gentry grins. He knows Linda very well and is happy to see
her. He takes her into his arms and is about to kiss her when
she pulls away.
LINDA
I left a message on your machine...
Pete, I'd invite you in, but... I
have a friend staying over.
As if introduced, the door opens and her FRIEND takes a step
into the hall. He's one sweat-stained muscle. He wears a
towel. Nothing else.
LINDA'S FRIEND
Hey, Linda, where'd ya go?
Linda's Friend takes one look at Gentry's hands on his girl
and frowns. Linda writhes free.
LINDA
(faking it)
Tomorrow. And I'd really
appreciate it, Pete.
(to Friend)
Pete's my neighbor. He's going to
give me a hand tomorrow with some -Disgusted, Gentry enters his apartment before she can finish
explaining.
INT. GENTRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Neat it isn't. Nor homey. Nor telling of the man who lives
here. Its lack of permanence is a statement itself.
Gentry exits the bathroom wearing a robe. He pours himself
two fingers of liquor and drops onto the bed. He sips the
whiskey.
A sound. From the apartment next door. A pounding noise.
Rhythmic. Linda's bed hitting the wall. And then another
noise. A woman's voice. Linda's. Ecstasy.
Gentry sips.

Thinks.

INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM - DAY
8x10 glossies drop to a table top. Each is of Douglas
Ericksen. Dead. Mask half-pulled off. Bullet holes and
blood everywhere.
Gentry, holding a phone to his ear and eating idly from a
huge pastry, drops the last photo and stares at them,
thinking.
Leon enters with a cup of steaming water and takes one sour
look at Gentry's pastry before:
GENTRY
(irritated)
What? What are you looking at?
LEON
Chemicals. They got chemicals in
that doughnut that could preserve a
fart.
Leon sits behind his desk, pulls out a tin of herb tea,
begins preparing his morning ritual.
GENTRY
Leon, you're thirty pounds
overweight.
LEON
Yeah, but they're good pounds. No
chemicals. No junk.
Gentry's expression says, Oh, Jeez.
GENTRY
(phone)
Hello? No, that's okay. I'm on
city time... Well, thanks. We
appreciate the cooperation.
(hangs up; referring to
notes)
Douglas Ericksen checked into the
Mark Hopkins at 10:30 yesterday
morning. No one at the desk can
identify him, but he used a credit
card and signed both the receipt
and the desk register.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

LEON
What about his stuff?
GENTRY
It's still there. That was a San
Francisco PD detective named
Larson. He just inventoried
everything in Ericksen's room.
LEON
(as if saying, "Go on.")
Yeah? So?
GENTRY
More notable for what wasn't found.
No receipt for a second set of
airline tickets. Just Ericksen's
bags filled with clothes. His
appointment book.
This perks Leon up.
Yeah?

LEON
What about -- ?

GENTRY
Already checked. No San Francisco
appointments penned in. No San
Francisco numbers or contacts,
either.
Leon considers that a moment.

Then:

LEON
That just doesn't figure. Guy
plans on killing his wife, he'd be
sure to make the alibi look good.
Grabbing his coat off the back of a chair:
GENTRY
The appointment book doesn't prove
anything. Maybe he was a bad
record-keeper.
Sure.

LEON
That's how he got rich.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

GENTRY
Okay, one of us has to check the
airport for his car and travel
reservations, and one of us has to
go back out to the beach and finish
taking Mrs. Ericksen's statement.
Which do you want?
LEON
I have a choice, right?
Gentry grins.

Sure you do.

EXT. ERICKSEN HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY
Gentry's Porsche pulls into the driveway and Gentry exits and
moves for the side of the house.
EXT. SIDE DOOR OF ERICKSEN HOUSE - DAY
Gentry pushes the street gate open and paces down the walk
siding the house to the door. He taps on the glass.
GENTRY
Mrs. Ericksen! Mrs. Ericksen!
No answer. There's a sheet of paper folded and taped to the
door. He flips it up and reads: Glass installers: I'll be
back soon. Please get the job started. Adrienne Ericksen.
Gentry pushes the door. It swings open.
INT. ERICKSEN HOUSE - DAY
Gentry enters, closing the door behind him.
GENTRY
Mrs. Ericksen?
Again, no answer.

He ascends the steps and a moment later

The billowing drape tells him the deck door is open.
EXT. ERICKSEN HOUSE DECK - DAY
Gentry steps outside. A moment later he's leaning on the
rail, allowing the wind to caress him. His body language
seems to say, God, I could get used to this! Then he sees:
Adrienne running from the sea. She wears a skimpy bikini,
her hair tussled and sexy. She moves up the beach and
doesn't notice the man standing on her deck until she is halfway up the steps.

He follows her inside.
INT. ERICKSEN HOUSE - DAY
Gentry watches Adrienne cross the living room to a closet
where a short terricloth robe hangs. She pulls it on, turns
before his sight can rise. She cinches the robe with
finality.
ADRIENNE
I'm flattered, Sergeant. Under
happier circumstances, I would be
very flattered. Can I get you
something?
Something?

GENTRY

ADRIENNE
To drink?

No. You're a cop and you're on

She finds a bottle in a cupboard, reaches up to get it.
Gentry watches the robe ride up her long, lovely legs.

GENTRY

Surprised, she looks over her shoulder at him, then pours
several fingers of Bourbon into a water glass, drops in ice.

You said last night that your

Not necessary. I just need a name.
ADRIENNE

Something like that. It's on

ADRIENNE
I imagine he's the owner.
GENTRY
He called you?
Yes.

ADRIENNE
Is that important?

ADRIENNE

loved him... passionately. If he
hadn't been wearing a mask, I don't
think I could have... pulled the
trigger.
Tears roll down her cheeks. She is fighting to retain
control of herself. Gentry is silenced by her emotions.
Finally:
GENTRY

this territory.
She gestures a mute consent.
GENTRY
How was your husband's business

problems?

far as I know, everything was fine.

sum. I don't recall the amount. I
saw it for all of five minutes.
GENTRY
Do you have the combination to your
husband's safe?
ADRIENNE
No. The subject just never came
up. Douglas took care of me. He
was that kind of man.
Gentry pauses, gauging her durability before asking:
GENTRY
Did you ever suspect there might be
another woman?
The pain of the question rolls across her expression.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

No.

ADRIENNE
Never.

GENTRY
Is it possible he could have been
seeing someone and you not know
about it?
ADRIENNE
I don't think so...
(tearful)
Sergeant, I don't know what to
believe about my husband. Not
anymore.
No.

Gentry leans close.
GENTRY
Mrs. Ericksen, the best possible
scenario we can make of this is
that your husband attempted to
murder you in cold blood. He did
that for some reason. You've got
to help me find that reason.
Adrienne writhes with the question, shaking, tears cascading
down her cheeks as her mind questions everything her married
life has been up until this moment.
ADRIENNE
I don't know! I don't know!
(sobbing)
I don't know-I don't know-I don't
know... why my husband didn't love
me!
She collapses into herself, burying her head in her arms.
Gentry struggles with himself. His professionalism dictates
that he retain distance. And yet... Gentry rises, crosses
to the couch, lays a hand on her shoulder.
GENTRY
Mrs. Ericksen, is there anything I
can -Adrienne turns and buries herself in Gentry's arms.
Startled, Gentry pulls her into an embrace. His hand reaches
out to stroke her hair, but stops inches from contact.
Sensing his awkwardness, she looks up. Their eyes connect.
Each realizes desire for the other. Finally, she pulls away.

ADRIENNE
(straightening)
I'm sorry. I shouldn't act like...
Shaky, she turns away.

Gentry reaches out to steady her.

GENTRY
Can I get you something?
ADRIENNE
No. Actually, I have a
prescription. Something to calm me
down.
GENTRY
You've seen your doctor since last
night?
Adrienne pulls away, begins to move for the stairs.
ADRIENNE
No. I take them for... I get
depressed, sometimes. Sergeant,
I'm sorry, but they usually make me
sleep. Perhaps tomorrow?
Sure.

GENTRY
Tomorrow.

Gentry watches as she ascends the stairs. A part of him
wants to follow her. He hears the door upstairs close before
turning and moving for the exit.
EXT. FAST-FOOD FRANCHISE - DAY
Gentry and Leon at the counter.

Gentry looks troubled.

GENTRY

Coffee. That's it.
As the counter girl rings up Gentry's order:
LEON
Jesus, what's the matter with you?
This is the perfect opportunity to
load up on empty calories.
GENTRY
Not hungry, that's all.
COUNTER GIRL
That's sixty-five.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

Gentry gives her a five.

As she makes change:

LEON
So what did you find out?
GENTRY
(shrugs)
If there's another woman, she
doesn't know about her. She also
says that as far as she knows her
husband's business was doing fine.
LEON
Insurance policy?
GENTRY
Joint survivor's benefit. She says
it's substantial. She doesn't
recall the exact amount.
Ha!

LEON
I believe that!

COUNTER GIRL
(counting change)
Seventy-five, a dollar, two, three,
four, and five.

Sir?
LEON
I don't know. You got anything

COUNTER GIRL

I'm sorry, sir?
LEON
You know. Grease. You got
anything that doesn't have grease

COUNTER GIRL
No, we don't have salads, sir. We

Gentry is beginning to look like he doesn't know this guy.

Maybe he rented a car.

GENTRY
Or someone drove him.
Leon grins.
LEON
Like a girlfriend, right? Which

You're trying to clear the girl,

Here's the address.
Gentry turns, but something happening at the counter stills
him:
Two latinos, obviously gang members wearing their "colors,"
divide just inside the door. One pulls a sawed-off shotgun
from beneath a jacket and aims it toward the eaters. The
second bares a handgun and leaps the counter to begin
emptying cash registers.
HANDGUN
(to register girl)
Back off, bitch!

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

He gives her a shove. She collides with the stove and burns
her arm. Handgun pays her no mind.
Shotgun is grinning and sweating. The glare in his eyes says
Please! Someone fuck up and let me kill!
Gentry's eyes meet Leon's.

Not here.

Not now.

Too many

Fate intervenes. A teenage girl exits the women's room
unaware of what's going on and startles Shotgun, who pivots
and fires.
The round impacts near the girl. Gentry pulls his service
revolver as Shotgun pumps another round into the chamber.
Shotgun aims at the girl, enraged that she should expose his
fear, as Gentry takes aim.
Police!

GENTRY
Freeze!

Shotgun pivots and fires at Gentry in one instinctive motion.
Gentry leaps behind a table as the shotgun round takes out
the plate glass behind him, which shatters into ten thousand
pieces.
Shotgun turns his weapon on Leon, who just now has cleared
his service revolver. He drops like dead weight as, across
the fast food restaurant, Gentry rises and fires twice -Bang! Bang! to send Shotgun sprawling, but not before his
last round flips Leon's hiding table away as if it were a
tent flap in the wind.
Behind the counter, Handgun has witnessed the robbery turn to
merde and grabs the register girl, retreating toward the rear
exit as she screams for help.
Leon advances with his revolver as Shotgun, bloodied but not
out, crawls toward his weapon. Leon cocks the revolver.
LEON
Move and you die, asshole!
Shotgun's eyes meet Leon's.

His fingers are mere inches from

Gentry leaps the counter the moment Handgun drags the girl
out of the place. A second later he bursts through the door.

EXT. REAR OF FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY
Gentry explodes through the door, weapon readied, only to
find the countergirl screaming hysterically and Handgun
nowhere to be found.
GENTRY
Where is he? Where did he go?
The countergirl won't stop screaming, but gestures toward the
back alley. Gentry takes off.
FOLLOW GENTRY & HANDGUN
running flat-out at opposite ends of an alley. Handgun
pivots in full flight, sees Gentry sprinting toward him, and
leaps laterally behind trash cans for cover.
Gentry sees Handgun's maneuver but continues forward, moving
toward one side of the alley as Handgun rises and fires.
Gentry dives for a hill of abandoned storage flats, rising
once to return fire before moving closer.
Handgun rises and lays down a barrage of fire as he retreats
down an intersecting alley. Gentry leaps for cover as the
rounds impact where he stood moments before, then rises and
paces after the retreating gunman.
ANOTHER ALLEY - FOLLOW THE ACTION
as Gentry turns into the alley and sees that it's a dead-end.
Four and five story buildings make the wall of the alley, and
at its end, a locked, gated fence. Gentry advances, service
revolver held ready, looking left and right, a swinging
motion, the rhythm of predator seeking prey.
A flattened cardboard box to one side moves an inch.
aims his weapon at the box and advances.

Gentry

GENTRY
Police officer! Throw out your
weapon!
A lizard squirms from beneath the box an instant before
Handgun bursts from behind oil drums on the other side of the
alley. He throws his empty gun at Gentry and explodes past
him.
Gentry dodges the thrown gun, aims his revolver -- an easy
shot.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

GENTRY
Stop or I'll shoot!
Handgun is in full flight.

He has no intention of stopping.

Gentry holsters his revolver and pursues.
Handgun hits a fence and is nearly over when Gentry's hands
yank him down. Gentry has forty pounds of muscle on the kid,
who responds to being manhandled by pulling a switchblade.
His first swipe cuts Gentry's cheek. His second is stopped
inches from penetrating Gentry's face. Gentry forces the
knife-wielding arm back, breaks the kid's grip, then hits him
square in the face. Bam! The kid goes down. Gentry
straddles Handgun and continues pounding on him -- Bam!-Bam!Bam! -- the violence a catharsis.
Leon, rushing up the alley, sees what's happening and moves
to pull Gentry off the latino gang member.
LEON
Okay! Okay! You've got him, Pete!
You've got him!
GENTRY
You're under arrest, asshole!
Leon jerks Gentry free.
Okay!

LEON
I think he knows that!

Gentry wants more of him and in coiled frustration pivots and
marches down the alley as Leon cuffs the kid.
EXT. REAR OF FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY
Leon guides the manacled Handgun up the alley toward waiting
black-and-whites and an ambulance. Gentry leans against his
Porsche smoking a cigarette.
Leon turns Handgun over to two blue suits, gives them unheard
instructions, then walks to Gentry as, nearby, Shotgun is
loaded into the ambulance on a gurney.
LEON
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.

GENTRY
I'm fine.

LEON

Yeah, I blew it. Won't happen

The Porsche's engine turns over and the instant it catches it
roars away.
Leon watches it go.

Wondering what's become of his partner.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ERICKSEN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Gentry's Porsche squeals to a stop behind Leon's very square,

GENTRY
He's not going to use paper with
his name attached, that's for sure.
Maybe it's a leased car. Maybe he
bought one used and never reregistered it.
LEON
Maybe there aint no car.
Gentry ignores this.

Then:

LEON
What about the cab companies?
Zip.

GENTRY

Leon continues inside. Gentry stops. Something across the
street in front of a drug store has captured his attention.
Adrienne Ericksen standing beside a cab she's just exited.
Looking like she's about to break down. The sight stills
him. Steeling herself, Adrienne enters the drug store and a
moment later Gentry enters the office building.
INT. ERICKSEN BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
The BUILDING MANAGER, an impeccably dressed man of 50, guides
Leon and Gentry down a long corridor.
MANAGER

GENTRY
How long since he moved to the

He let his secretary go last month.
INT. ERICKSEN'S OFFICE - DAY
Expensive business footage, but packed with too much

Organizational despair.
Gentry and Leon share a look.

Oh shit...

Ever the rental professional, the Manager moves for a window.

Leon begins thumbing through files stacked on a cabinet.
GENTRY
Where's the safe?
MANAGER
It's embedded in the floor. There.
Behind the desk.
GENTRY

Do you have the combination?
MANAGER

No, of course not. Tenants make

Either he had a lot of money and

Gentry drops his folder in front of Leon.
GENTRY
Have a look at this. He was kiting
funds from one investment account
to another trying to cover his
losses.
The drill whine stops.
That's it.

DRILLER
She's open.

He pulls the safe open. A moment later Gentry lifts the
cache basket from the safe.
DRILLER
(holding out form)
Somebody want to sign this?

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

Leon signs it as Gentry quickly goes through the documents in
the basket: A small stack of 20s paper-clipped together,
various mortgage and lease contracts, and an insurance
packet. Gentry flips to the back page. Two items stick out:
$2.000.000.00 and Beneficiary: Douglas Ericksen and/or
Adrienne Ericksen.
EXT. ERICKSEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT
Gentry closes the driver's door of Leon's unmarked car and
leans down.
LEON
(fingering reasons)
Okay. We got motive. Ericksen was
desperate for money and he had a
two million dollar survivor's
benefit insurance policy. We got
opportunity. His wife home alone

we need is method.
GENTRY
Wait a second! Wait! Wait! All

I aint sure o'nothin'. I'm just
saying we can wrap this sucker up

Leon starts his engine.

glances back at the still-open pharmacy across the street.
He makes for it.

EXT./INT. GENTRY'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Gentry paces the car, taking corners on two wheels and
generally pushing city driving to the hilt.
INT. GENTRY'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
Gentry paces down the hall. He fishes for his keys. The
next door down opens. Linda steps out. She's wearing a
shirt. Probably his. One button joined. And nothing else.

Gentry takes one look at her.

Yes.

LINDA

About putting you in that

LINDA
I just... wanted to see you and

His thumbs trail down each side of the shirt to the only
button. In one swift, powerful jolt he yanks her to him,
snapping the button and pinning her naked body to him.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

Gentry kisses her long and hard, then reaches up behind and
under the shirt, lifts her off the ground and carries her
into her apartment, their lips still joined.
INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The door closes behind them. Linda's feet still dangle
inches from the floor. Gentry peels the shirt from her body
with one hand. She is completely naked. Still they kiss.
The shirt drops to the floor.
LATER
Both naked now, Linda's legs have Gentry in a scissor-lock as
he spins her around and around the apartment. She squeals
with delight.
LATER YET
Linda lies face-down on the bed as Gentry, out of shot,
pounds her in rhythmic succession. Linda's cries rise to a
crescendo.
LATER EVEN YET
Linda and Gentry lie on her bed. She's asleep. Gentry's
cigarette ash glows, casting them in brief amber light, then
dies. In the instant of its radiance Gentry's troubled face
burns in brilliant clarity. Linda is not Adrienne.
Gentry snaps up, frustrated and angry. Linda turns over,
fully asleep, and does not see him get dressed and leave.
INT. GENTRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Gentry enters still buttoning his shirt. He takes a bottle
of beer from the fridge, pries its cap off, and drinks
thirstily. The blinking light of his phone answering machine
beckons from across the room.
A moment later, he rewinds the tape, turns it to replay.
ADRIENNE'S VOICE
(troubled)
Sergeant Gentry... I wanted to tell

Gentry's Porsche skids to an angled stop before the driveway.
He leaps from the car, leaving the driver's door agape behind

EXT. SIDE OF ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Gentry runs down the walk to the side door and knocks
quickly. When there is no answer, he knocks again before:

Gentry kicks.

The door whips open.

Gentry charges in.

INT. ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Adrienne sits at the kitchen table before a small mountain of
pills. Trails of recent tears mark her face. Gentry is
stunned by the sight of her. This lovely woman looks near
death.
For moments neither can say anything.

Finally:

ADRIENNE
I couldn't...

Gentry rushes to her and pulls her into an embrace. He holds
her close. She begins to sob into his chest. Finally he
sweeps her up into his arms and moves for the stairs.

Gentry awakens in the chair and starts when he finds Adrienne
gone. He spins -- and sees her standing in the shadows.
Adrienne has showered. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is
combed back and still wet. She just looks at Gentry as he
steps to her side. Finally:
ADRIENNE
This isn't right.
GENTRY
He tried to murder you, Mrs. Erick-Addie.

GENTRY
He tried to kill you, Addie. For

ADRIENNE

She pulls on the robe cinch and it loosens. The robe falls
to the floor. Gentry takes in her exquisite nakedness. She
reaches up to him, kissing, caressing, gently undoing
buttons.
A MONTAGE OF LOVE-MAKING
Fingertips caress. Lips hover, then sensuously kiss flesh.
Moist lips meet and part, creating a bridge of their juices.

Now it is Gentry who sleeps as Adrienne studies him, gently
caressing his brow. Finally, she smiles.

Just after dawn. Addie remains on her side studying him as
Gentry awakens. At first disoriented, it takes a moment for
Gentry to realize he's died and gone to heaven. Beneath this

GENTRY
What time is it?
ADRIENNE
A little after six.

Sleep well?

Addie grins.

She begins to caress his shoulder and chest.

ADRIENNE
So what now... Officer?
GENTRY
I've got to get this case wrapped
up.
Her hands explore down below the sheet, gently caressing.
For Gentry, her touch is an aphrodisiac. As she touches him:
ADRIENNE
I thought you said you had it
wrapped up?
GENTRY
Well, there are some procedural
things left. We've got to document
each step your husband took that
night. The only things missing are
the rental car and his return
ticket to San Francisco. Until
then, officially at least, the case
stays open and you remain a

He bought it.

Not careful enough.

Yeah, I guess so...
Seeing Leon's reluctance:

What's the matter?
Nothing.
Bullshit.

If you were married to Adrienne

LEON (cont'd)
He could have found an easier way
to turn a buck than by murdering
his wife for the insurance money...
Now if there was another reason...

could believe.
Gentry pauses, considers.

Then smiles at his partner.

GENTRY
I don't buy a girlfriend
Leon gives him a look that asks, "Oh?"
GENTRY
With a wife like her at home, who
needs another woman?
LEON
(big grin)
Hey, people always want what they
don't got. Guy has a beautiful
woman at home, he goes out and
sleeps with dogs, the ugliest women
he can find. Or maybe he wants a
brunette or a redhead 'cause the
little woman is a blond.
GENTRY
I still don't buy it.
LEON
That's from your perspective
because she's something you don't
got.
Gentry slams the trunk.
Leon.

A little too hard.

Turns back to

So what are you saying? You're

Gentry pounds away at an old manual typewriter, finishing the

Leon sits nearby going through their previous reports. He
stops. Something is bothering him. He picks up the phone

LATER
Across the room, Gentry stands watching the laser printer
spit out the first hard copy. It slides into a wire basket.
Gentry picks it up, looks at it:
Adrienne. Different hair. Different make-up. Almost a
honky-tonk version of Adrienne, but almost certainly her
nonetheless. Gentry covers her hair. The resemblance is more
striking.
COMPUTER OPERATOR'S VOICE
Anybody you know?
Gentry spins, startled by the Operator's unintentional
stealth.
What?

GENTRY

He's kidding, but he asks it again:
COMPUTER OPERATOR
Anybody you know?
GENTRY

No, I don't think so.
Leon moves up behind Gentry as the computer operator leaves

LEON
Looks like I was wrong.
GENTRY
What do you mean?
LEON
About Ericksen's girlfriend.
GENTRY

Oh? How's that?

From across the room, Leon realizes that Gentry hasn't moved.
He gives him a quizzical look before:
LEON
Hey, you hear me?
Sure.

I said --

GENTRY
I'll do it.

LEON
See ya tomorrow.
Right.

GENTRY
Tomorrow.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY
Gentry watches copy after copy of the sketch slide out of the
photocopy machine, images of Adrienne, one after another. He
scoops up a dozen and makes for a desk.
Gentry draws a new hairstyle onto one of the copies, alters
the make-up look with a few nervous scrawls... and sits back.
LATER
Half of the sketches have been altered by Gentry's inexpert
hand. No matter how many times you ask the question, the
answer's the same: Adrienne.
He dumps all of the copies into a briefcase and shuts it.
EXT./INT. GENTRY'S PORSCHE - DAY
He powers the metal beast down the Coast Highway.
EXT. ADRIENNE'S DRIVEWAY & HOUSE - DAY
The Porsche rolls to a stop in the gravel. Gentry slides out
slowly. Weighted down. Pulling the briefcase out of the
car, Gentry makes for the walkway leading to the side door.
For a long moment Gentry stands before the door, indecisive.
Finally he enters.

INT. ERICKSEN HOUSE - DAY
Gentry enters. No one home, apparently. He sets the
briefcase down on the counter, moves for the sliding door.
EXT. ERICKSEN HOUSE BEACH DECK - DAY
Addie lies sunbathing on a lounger. Gentry appears at the
sliding door and takes her in a moment before he exits. He
walks to the rail, looks out to sea.
ADRIENNE
Is something wrong?
No.

GENTRY
Nothing.

Addie rises, moves up behind Gentry and begins to massage his
neck and shoulders. Fighting it, Gentry finds the massage
nonetheless wonderful.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Addie releases Gentry just inside the door and goes to turn
on the water in the shower. Steam billows over the top of
the glass wall before she returns and begins to unbutton and
unfasten his clothes.
He stops her.
GENTRY
No... No, look, you go ahead. I
just want to relax for a little
while. Unwind. I'll take a shower
later.
Only momentarily disappointed:
ADRIENNE
Have it your own way.
She takes several steps toward the shower, then spins and
loosens the robe tie.
ADRIENNE
Just so you know what you're
missing.
The robe falls to the floor. She grins, turns and walks to

look away. Smitten. Chained. Only after the shower door
closes does he retreat from the bathroom.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

INT. ADRIENNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
Gentry stops in the doorway from the bathroom and takes in
the room. Gentry quickly peruses the top of Adrienne's
vanity, noting ironically her brand of perfume, Deceit,
before moving to her desk.
At the desk Gentry takes one look over his shoulder at the
open bathroom door. Steam still rises, billowing out.
Gentry sits, thinks about it a moment, then pulls open the
drawer. He finds Adrienne's appointment and address book.
He opens it, begins going down the list.
Nothing. Second: No. Third...

First page:

Adrienne grabs him from behind! She cups his eyes and
laughs, her naked, soapy body staining his clothes. Gentry
twists and the appointment/address book tumbles to the floor.
Addie falls into his arms, unaware or uncaring about the
book. For a long moment he holds her, their eyes locked. His
eyes take in her wet, exquisite body. She begins to unbutton
his shirt, then rips it open in frustration, kissing his
chest and nipples.
ADRIENNE
(between kisses)
Pete, I'm sorry... so sorry, I...
can't... help... it... I...
want... you... to... Oh!
Gentry's reserve breaks like a cracked dam. He stands and
yanks her up into his arms and carries her to the bed. She
crashes onto it but is up in an instant to undo his pants.
MOMENTS LATER
their naked bodies writhe in unleashed lust. Addie cries in
pleasure and sweet pain as Gentry grabs her great mane of
hair, riding forward like a charging warrior.
LATER EVEN YET
they lie entwined, lovers whose last drop of passion has been
spent on the other.

INT. ADRIENNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Gentry lies sleeping. Addie studies him. She rises, careful
not to awaken him, slips on a robe and moves for the door.

KITCHEN - ADRIENNE
enters the kitchen, where Gentry left his briefcase. She
snaps the second lock out, then opens the case. Inside are
the copies of the computer-generated sketch. Startled, Addie
turns on a light and studies the sketches, each with a
different scribble to make it look more like her.
At the bottom of each picture is printed (by computer)
Description of ticket purchaser by Lester Fenady.
Startled by a noise behind her, Adrienne shuts the case and
spins around... only to find her cat, Buttermilk, meowing for
attention. She kneels to pet Buttermilk.
Just then Gentry enters the kitchen.

She starts.

GENTRY
What are you doing?
ADRIENNE
Oh!... I couldn't sleep. I just
came down for a drink. What about
you? Can I get you something?
No thanks.

GENTRY

Adrienne moves for the door.

Looking back over her shoulder:

ADRIENNE
You coming?
GENTRY
I'll be there in a minute.
Adrienne leaves. Gentry opens the briefcase. The sketch of
Adrienne/look-alike sits on top of a pile of papers. Did she
see the sketch?, a worried look at the door asks. Gentry
closes the case and spins the combination locks.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Addie and Gentry sit across the breakfast table from one
another. Each eats quietly. Inner thoughts. Tension.
Gentry's beeper goes off. He stands, taps a number into the
wall phone.

EXT. ADRIENNE'S DRIVEWAY - DAY
Gentry paces toward his car. The moment he slides behind the
wheel and turns the key in the ignition, Adrienne strolls
from the walkway to watch him go. The Porsche's starting
motor drones, the cold engine almost catches, then dies.
Gentry tries it again. It dies again.
GENTRY
Piece of shit!
ADRIENNE
Want me to call Triple-A?
No.

GENTRY
It's cold, that's all.

The engine catches. Gentry throws it in reverse and the
Porsche screeches out of the driveway.

Gentry finds LASZLO KINSKI, late 30s, a lean and intelligent
man who speaks with a faint Eastern European accent,
"dusting" a table.

Gentry enters and finds Leon nearly engulfed by clothes in
the wall closet.
Leon.

Leon has found something.
LEON
Look at this.
He opens a suit coat displaying a label.

Reading:

LEON
Hand-made for Douglas Ericksen by
Cleve and Sons, London Tailors.
Gentry takes one look at the label before:
Bingo.

GENTRY

The coat lands on the bed.

LATER
There are now two nearly equal piles of clothing on the bed,
half suits and sportcoats, the other half dresses and
blouses. Gentry tosses the last jacket as Leon checks the
last dress. Nothing.
LEON
Look at this shit! This isn't
Paris originals shit; this is KMart shit! I don't get it.
Ericksen was a classy guy, right?
But this broad dresses like she's
on welfare. Something else bothers
me. There's nothing personal here.
No family pictures. No phone books
or old mail or just plain crap she
couldn't bring herself to throw
away.
GENTRY
Maybe there isn't anything she
can't throw away.
LEON
That would make her a strange
woman, all right.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Gentry enters to find Laszlo "dusting" one side of a vanity
table too large for the bedroom.
GENTRY
So how's it look?
LASZLO
Pretty clean.
Gentry turns his attention to the opposite side of the table
where several dozen perfume and lotion bottles are arranged.
GENTRY
You done here?
Yeah.

LASZLO
Nothing.

One bottle beckons: Deceit. The same scent Adrienne wears.
Gentry stares at it a long moment before picking it up. It
remains in his hand, a symbol for something far more
important, until:

Startled, Gentry composes himself before:
GENTRY
Yeah, so does Ericksen's wife.
Something catches Gentry's attention, a fold of thick paper
wedged behind the vanity table. He kneels, slips his hand
under the table and pulls the paper out: A take-out menu
from a Greek restaurant, Alexander's.
Gentry studies the menu's logo. This is the first personal
clue found in "Marta's" apartment.

as Fenady enters the house and unbuttons his shirt as he
walks toward the phone. An instant later Fenady has dialed
the phone. He grins, obviously talking to someone very
intimate. Still grinning, he hangs up, goes to the door and
unlocks it.
THE MOVING POINT OF VIEW
navigates around the side of the house through the bushes to
the REAR DECK, watching as Fenady, wearing only a towel,
exits the house while pulling the cork out of a bottle of
champagne. He drops the bottle into an ice bucket, slips a
cassette into a nearby boom box, yanks the towel free and
slides into a steaming hot tub.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

THE POINT OF VIEW MOVES CLOSER
as Fenady, oblivious to this intruder, pours himself a glass
of champagne and settles back for a little hedonistic
pleasure.
Gloved hands -- those of this intruder -- reach out and lift
the boom box over the back of Fenady's head. Still plugged
in, the box drops into the water. Fenady's spasmodic body
almost leaps from the tub. But he settles back into the
frothy mass of water, boiling like a two-minute egg.
EXT. SAN PEDRO APARTMENT POOL - DAY
Gentry and Leon wait as the apartment manager, MR. ZAZEL, 56,
a Lithuanian emigre to America, stares at the police sketch
of Adrienne/look-alike. Finally:
ZAZEL
Yes, this is her. She live here,
oh -- four month. Maybe five. She
pay cash. Always cash.
GENTRY
Did she give any references?
No.

ZAZEL
No references.

Just cash.

LEON
Did she have any visitors?
you might remember?

Anyone

ZAZEL
There was man, big man. Maybe
boyfriend. He come visit.
Leon produces the coroner's photograph of Ericksen.

Zazel takes it from Leon's hand and studies it before:
Not sure.

ZAZEL
Maybe.

A uniformed cop steps up.
UNIFORMED COP

He's dead.

UNIFORMED COP

INT. FENADY'S HOUSE - DAY
Gentry, Leon and a bulbous cop, FATCOP, pace through Fenady's
house.
FATCOP
His girl friend found him, say onethirty. She came over and there he
was floating in the tub.
LEON
Homicide dejour.
FATCOP
Accidental death. Clear and
simple. Don't you guys try and
fuck up my case load.
Shit.

GENTRY
Hate to do that.

EXT. REAR DECK OF FENADY'S HOUSE - DAY
Fatcop leads Gentry and Leon through Fenady's back door to
the deck. Fenady's naked body floats in the tub. The
cassette player, its cord still plugged into a nearby floor
socket, is wedged between his flesh and the tub side.
LEON
(eyeing body)
I think he's done.
Cute.

FATCOP

GENTRY
You should know Fenady was a
witness in an on-going homicide
investigation.

FATCOP
That the way you guys see this?
Homicide? I see accidental death.
Gentry kneels to have a closer look at the boom box.
GENTRY
How do you figure?
FATCOP
He's in the tub. He reaches over
there -(gestures table)
to change the channel and -GENTRY
There's a cassette in the player.
FATCOP
Okay, then, change the cassette. He
touches the boom box, it shorts out
and he can't let go. He drags it
into the tub and fries.
Not fry.

LEON
Poach, maybe, but not

A MOMENT LATER
Gentry and Leon make their way to the door.
LEON
Okay, maybe it was an accident.
Maybe.

GENTRY

LEON
Or maybe Ericksen's girlfriend is
trying to get rid of any witnesses.
Fenady could have tied her to the
attempted murder of Mrs. Ericksen.
Maybe.

GENTRY

LEON
I could believe it myself except
for one thing.
GENTRY
What's that?

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

LEON
How did she find out about Fenady?
How'd she get his address?
But Gentry's mind is too occupied with dark thoughts for him
to respond. Adrienne. The police sketch. Then:
LEON
You know what I think? I think the
girlfriend was the brains behind
Ericksen. She's the one who talked
him into trying to kill his wife...
I think we got one smart, crazy
bitch out there.
EXT. ADRIENNE'S BEACH HOUSE DECK - NIGHT
Gentry stands at the rail staring out to sea. The door
slides open behind him. Addie steps out with two windshielded candles and places them on the dining table that's
been set up on the deck. She lights each candle, then turns
to look at Gentry. Sensing his emotional distance, she comes
up behind him, loops her arms through his, then circles him
for a kiss. His lips are as cold as marble. Adrienne draws
back.
ADRIENNE
There's something on your mind.
What is it?
Gentry doesn't answer, continues staring out to sea.
ADRIENNE
Won't you tell me -- ?

She flinches at his

GENTRY
And then what?
ADRIENNE
I moved out. I went to a hotel. I
told Douglas he had to choose
between us. I couldn't live that
way. And he... and he chose me...
I thought.
GENTRY
Why didn't you tell me any of this?
ADRIENNE
I... It was too painful. Like
opening an old wound. I didn't
want you to know because... just
being a part of it made me feel
dirty. I wanted to start fresh.
With you.
Gentry studies her in silence before:
GENTRY
He said you reminded him of Marta.
Did he say why?
ADRIENNE
The time I saw her I knew why. It
was really uncanny, she looked so
much like me. We could have been
sisters.
Adrienne wipes tears from her eyes and tries to compose
herself.
ADRIENNE
Why were you asking me those
questions about what I did today?
(when he doesn't answer)
Something's happened... TELL ME,
DAMN IT!

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

Gentry considers it a long moment making up his mind, then
pulls a folded Xerox of Adrienne/look-alike from his pocket
and gives it to her.
GENTRY
Is that Marta?
Stunned and fearful even in the presence of Marta's likeness,
Adrienne gestures yes.
ADRIENNE
What did she do?
GENTRY
We think she's your husband's
accomplice. She helped him set up
an alibi.
ADRIENNE
That's all?
Gentry almost doesn't answer.

Then:

GENTRY
No. There was a man who could have
identified her. He died today. It
may have been homicide.
ADRIENNE
Oh my god...
Gentry takes the drawing from her hands, looks at it.
GENTRY
She looks a lot like you.
ADRIENNE
Yes, I know...
(realizing)
You think... thought it was me!
GENTRY
I didn't know what to think.
Adrienne turns from him and buries her face in her hands,
crying. Gentry turns her about, pulls her into his arms.
ADRIENNE
Oh, Pete, I'm scared...
she comes after me?
She won't.

What if

GENTRY
I won't let her.

Gentry turns the Porsche engine over. Adrienne watches from
the gate holding her robe shut with folded hands. The
starter motor drones on, without effect. Finally:
ADRIENNE
I could call someone.
Frustrated, Gentry crawls out of the Porsche.
No time.

GENTRY
I'll get a cab.

ADRIENNE
You can take my car.
EXT./INT. MERCEDES - DAY
Gentry slips behind the wheel of Adrienne's Mercedes. The
engine catches immediately.
Gentry guides the luxury car out onto the Coast Highway, then
up-Sunset Boulevard. Deciding to see what this baby can do,
he checks the rear-view mirror, sees no one, then floors it.
The Mercedes bolts forward.
Gentry settles in behind the wheel, enjoying the speed,
testing the Mercedes against Sunset Boulevard's curves and
hills. Far ahead, he sees a street light turn red. He
applies the brakes.
Nothing. Worse, the Mercedes hasn't slowed its acceleration.
It jets forward, increasing speed. Gentry pulls the
emergency brake. Useless.
The Mercedes dashes for the stop light. Cars cross the
intersection at intervals. The light remains red. Gentry
slams a palm down on the horn. It blares a warning.
The Mercedes shoots through the intersection, barely missing
two crossing cars, and continues on, Gentry twisting its
wheel to avoid hitting anyone and slamming his foot on the
brake repeatedly. He passes cars on the left, then right,
and knowing he can hold off destruction no longer, Gentry
opens the driver's door and leaps free. He rolls to the side
of the road as the Mercedes impacts against a stone wall and
explodes in a fiery flash.

And I know how to use it.
EXT. ERICKSEN HOUSE - DAY
Gentry exits and turns to take Adrienne into his arms. They
kiss. Gentry lingers in the doorway savoring her before he
turns and makes for the gate... where Leon stands with a
sizable grin on his face. He's seen them together.
LEON
Doing a little... undercover work,
Pete?
Gentry stops dead, takes a look over his shoulder to insure
Adrienne hasn't seen Leon -- she hasn't; the door is long
since closed -- before turning to again face him. Then:
Okay.

GENTRY
So now you know.

LEON
Hey, don't get your back up. I'm
sympathetic. Envious, even. I
mean, that is one fine looking
woman you have in there...
GENTRY
What brings you out here, Leon?
LEON
I get a call that says my partner

you a picture?
GENTRY
You don't understand -LEON
Yeah, maybe I do and maybe I don't.
But I'm doing my thinking with an
organ located above my neck. Which
is more than I can say for you.
Steamed, Gentry almost physically confronts Leon. Only
respect and love keep him from pinning the older man against
the wall.
GENTRY
Okay, maybe I am breaking a couple
of rules!

GENTRY (cont'd)
But I'm not stupid and I haven't

me like a rookie, Leon!...
Adrienne didn't sabotage her own
car. Marta did!
LEON
Who's Marta?
GENTRY
Ericksen's mistress. Adrienne knew
her, met her once, anyway.
LEON
She ID'd the sketch?
Yeah.

GENTRY

LEON
Why didn't she come forward with
this before?
GENTRY
She thought it was over. She had
no reason to suspect her husband
was working with his ex-lover.
LEON
And now this Marta is out for
revenge, that it?
GENTRY
Yeah. She sabotaged the car. She
blames Adrienne for killing
Ericksen.
Leon studies Gentry before:
LEON
So what are they, identical
twins?... I'm not blind. Fenady's
sketch could be your girlfriend
there -GENTRY
She explained that. When she met
Ericksen, he told her she reminded
him of someone. His ex-fiance'.
Marta. What? You don't think a
man can be attracted to two women
for the same reasons?

Hungarian restaurant that
specializes in small furry insects

GENTRY
Sounds... appetizing. But I got a

Maybe next time.
Leon heads for the door.
LEON
Okay. Want me to bring you the
left-overs?
GENTRY
Nah. I'd be afraid they'd get
loose and mate with the locals.
Leon grins, throws Pete a wave and exits. The moment he's
gone, Gentry's smile fades. He sits thinking. Fenady's
sketch of Adrienne's look-alike peeks above a briefcase
partition.

He brings the drawing out, exposing the take-out menu from
Alexander's Restaurant found at "Marta's" apartment. Gentry

Yes...

GENTRY
No, actually, point someone out in

Sure.

I can. I guess.

ADRIENNE
Eight o'clock.

EXT. SAN PEDRO STREET - NIGHT
Gentry's Porsche pulls up before Zazel's apartment building
and he gets out, moving for the steps and ascending. Gentry
taps lightly on the door. It swings open.

Gentry leans inside.

Mr. Zazel?...
INTERIOR ZAZEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Gentry steps inside the nearly dark apartment. Having
received no answer to his call, he reaches for his service
revolver when a shadowy figure steps from behind a door and
hits him. Gentry collapses as the figure, briefly seen to be
a woman, rushes out.
DISSOLVE TO:
INTERIOR ZAZEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Moments have passed. Or hours. Gentry moans, reaches up to
his head and then looks at his hand. Blood.
Gentry crawls to a table, uses it to rise, then almost
topples a lamp before finding its switch. Light explodes
into the room. Blood has trickled and almost dried on his
brow. Dizzy, Gentry almost falls, then rights himself.
Something catches his attention across the room.
Dead.

Zazel.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ZAZEL'S BUILDING - NIGHT
Two coroner's assistants guide a gurney toward a waiting
wagon. Two uniformed cops finish querying Gentry (unheard)
for their report and walk away, leaving him leaning against
his Porsche, swathing his head with a ball of gauze he got
earlier from ambulance attendants.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

Gentry watches the old man's body being loaded into the
Coroner's wagon. Thoughts. Suspicion.
INT. ALEXANDER'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Gentry enters and moves for the Matre'D's desk. Blood and
sweat still caked on his face, Gentry's appearance is a
startling contrast to the diners about him.
GENTRY
The name is Gentry. I'm late. I
have an eight o'clock reservation.
But sir!

MATRE'D
It's after nine!

GENTRY
Yeah, that's fine. I'm just
checking to see if my date arrived.
Has anyone -- ?
MATRE'D
I'm sorry, sir, but no one used
your reservation.
Gentry considers what this means as streams of people surge
and flex about him. Then:
Telephone?

GENTRY

MATRE'D
In the alcove, sir.

There.

Gentry courses through the crowd to a phone alcove near the
restrooms, finds a coin, dials. The phone begins to ring.
No answer. The ringing drones on.
INTERIOR BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
The house lights are on. Buttermilk looks up from a nap to
take in the phone. It rings on.
INTERIOR ALEXANDER'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Gentry slowly removes the receiver from his ear, lowers it
into its cradle. The ringing stops. Finally. Gentry pivots
and exits.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
Gentry. Alone. Two shot glasses in front of him. Both
empty. The bartender brings another. Fills it. Gentry
empties it.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
The night crew is working. Two guys bored to hell. Playing
catch with a softball across the room. Gentry enters.
Tired. Mind-fucked. His briefcase is where he left it. So
is the picture. Gentry looks at it.
Nearby on the table is a small pile of pink phone message
notes. To Gentry. From Adrienne.
As the softball sails across the room, landing phlatt! again
and again in a mitt, Gentry stares at the sketch. A decision
has to be made, but he's reluctant to make it. Finally
Gentry stands, checks that his service revolver is loaded,
then makes for the door.
INT. ADRIENNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Reading a magazine, Adrienne reclines on her bed stroking
Buttermilk, her cat, who lies nearby.
A sound. From downstairs. Adrienne freezes. Another sound.
A repeat of the night Douglas was killed. Adrienne stands,
moves reluctantly for the door.
STAIRS - ADRIENNE
pauses at the top of the staircase and listens.

Nothing.

ADRIENNE
Pete, is that you?
Nothing. Adrienne pivots to return to the bedroom when
another noise sounds below.
Pete?

ADRIENNE

No response. Buttermilk slides past her and down the stairs.
She kneels and reaches out for the animal.
ADRIENNE
Buttermilk. Don't go down there.
But the cat is lost to the darkness.

Adrienne stands,

ADRIENNE

When there's no answer, she withdraws.

A MOMENT LATER
Adrienne returns. With the .357 Magnum revolver that chewed
up her husband. She follows its barrel's descent down the
steps.
LIVING ROOM - ADRIENNE
stops at the base of the stairs and listens. A snap and a
whoosh cause her to pivot and see Buttermilk near the drapes.
She takes a deep breath and sweeps her eyes across the room,
the gun barrel following, before realizing that the sliding
door to the deck is OPEN.
ADRIENNE
(trembling)
Pete, if this is your idea of a
practical joke, it isn't funny.
A form takes shape in the shadows outside. Adrienne gasps
and staggers back several steps, swinging the gun about
crazily, half out of control. The shadowy form moves closer,
entering the house. Adrienne continues to retreat, every
breath threatening to seize control of her. The figure
approaches.
ADRIENNE

This gun is loaded! I'll shoot!
I'll shoot, damn it!
Gentry steps into the light. The shadow figure.

Focused on each other, neither Gentry nor Adrienne have seen
Marta until this moment. Gentry leaps across the darkness
knocking Adrienne to the ground as muzzleflash after
muzzleflash explode in the darkness.
By the time Gentry is on his feet, the woman has disappeared.
He finds Adrienne.
GENTRY
Are you okay?
Yes!...

ADRIENNE
Marta!

Gentry bolts for the door.
EXT. ERICKSEN DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
Gentry rockets around the side of the house and past his own
Porsche to the street. He sees tail-lights flash down the
block before tires screech and the car accelerates away.
Gentry lowers his weapon and turns, almost colliding with
Adrienne.
The distance between them is nothing, and it is immense.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BEACH HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
Flashing red lights from the roofs of several police blackand-whites bathe the area in undulating waves of crimson.

nearby car, listening.

No. The moment Gentry's finished with the blue suits, he
turns and catches Leon's look. Gentry moves toward the

A moment later Leon follows Gentry and sees him enter the

where Gentry and Adrienne's assailant made her getaway.
INT. ADRIENNE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Gentry closes the door behind him. He sees Adrienne sitting
on the couch. Alone. Unmoving. Looking out the window at
the darkness and the sea.
Gentry moves to her.

But she has a cup in her lap.
No.

GENTRY
Addie, I -ADRIENNE
How could you make love to me...
(angry and tearful)

EXT. ADRIENNE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Leon stands just outside the window. He sees Gentry and
Adrienne talking and can barely hear the conversation.
Pulling a penlight from a jacket pocket, Leon squats with an
Oomph! and trails the penlight across the sand.
LEON
Jesus, I'm getting too old for this
shit...
Even from here, he can hear snippets of Gentry and Adrienne's
conversation between the crashing of waves.
GENTRY'S VOICE
I said I was wrong. I'm sorry.
ADRIENNE'S VOICE
But how could you believe that,
Pete? Don't you know me? Don't
you know who I am by now?
Leon's penlight beam is picking up nothing but sand and a
myriad of footprints. He sees something and reaches for it.
GENTRY'S VOICE
I know who you are, Addie.

Leon pulls a pair of swimming trunks from the sand. Nearby,
something that looks like an opaque balloon. He reaches for
that too, until he realizes what it is and throws it into the
darkness.
LEON
Shit! Shit! Probably got AIDS
from the fucking thing!
INT. ADRIENNE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Adrienne is at the door now, but continues to look out at the
night. Gentry stands across the room. Distance between
them. He realizes that it is insurmountable. Finally:

their bodies unite. He pulls her close.

Leon stands up and sees Adrienne as she is swallowed by
Gentry's arms. He spins her around. Her eyes open. On

Leon exits. Gentry takes in Adrienne across the room.
Buttermilk has curled up in her lap and she pets the cat
gently.
Gentry sits on the arm of the couch beside her.
GENTRY
Leon and I are going to check out a

thing is for you to accept police
protection and go to a hotel.
ADRIENNE
This is my home. I'm not going to

Buttermilk stretches, then wanders off.
GENTRY
What about police protection?

Oh, sure.

Paul Basque. He's good.

Can I see a picture?
The Theater Manager pulls a photo album from beneath the
counter.
THEATER MANAGER
(thumbing)
Sure. We keep all of the

the actors leave a supply of their
8x10s... Here it is.
She spins the photo album around. Leon looks. A half dozen
actors in contemporary dress in front of an amateurish backdrop. Young. Good looking.

Which one is he?

Sure. I'll get you an 8x10 and a

LEON

Thanks.

The moment she's gone, Leon again peruses the production
still before leafing through the book. He stops at one
photo. Private Lives, the caption reads. Two couples.
Again, Paul Basque. Leon's vision trails across to the woman
beside Basque in the picture. He freezes.
LEON

Oh, shit.
The woman is...

Adrienne.

Or her dead ringer, Marta!

Leon rips the photo free and rushes out.
EXT. ERICKSEN DRIVEWAY - DAY
Gentry ties two suitcases to the rack on the rear of his

Tell him it's an emergency. I'm

Gentry's belt pager sounds.

He twists to turn it off.

ADRIENNE
You want to stop and see what
that's about?

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

GENTRY
It can wait.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door swings open and the bellboy enters with Adrienne's
bags. Gentry and Adrienne follow. The bellboy places the
bags on the bed stand, pulls open the drapes, presents
himself for a tip and exits once Gentry hands him a bill.
The moment he's gone:
GENTRY
Okay, I want you to stay in this
room. Call room service for food.
Don't go outside. Not for
anything. Understood?
Adrienne's eyes sweep across her prison, then take in Gentry.
She nods assent.
GENTRY
Do you have the gun?
Adrienne opens her bag, takes out the .357 Magnum, returns
it. She tosses the bag to the bed.
ADRIENNE
Is it ever going to be over?
Gentry takes her, holds her rigid.

Gentry kisses her once more, and then he leaves. Adrienne
locks the door and gives the room a long, bored pan.
At the window, Adrienne sees Gentry exit the hotel and move
for his car. The beat-up Porsche thunders out of the parking
lot. Adrienne's eyes sweep the surroundings outside, stopping
on... a cat being fed by one of the hotel workers.

Adrienne picks up the phone and taps the receiver.

INTERIOR ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Adrienne opens the door to the dark house and enters, closing
the door behind her. She snaps on a light in the kitchen
which spills shadows into the living room.
ADRIENNE
Buttermilk? Buttermilk?...
Adrienne searchs the living room for a moment before
Buttermilk strolls out from behind the couch and into her
arms.
ADRIENNE
There you are!
Adrienne pets Buttermilk a moment before a shadow from the
kitchen light crawls across her. Startled, Adrienne spins...
to find Leon standing just inside the door.
Tense and fearful, Adrienne almost whispers:
ADRIENNE
Detective Kessler! You startled
me! What are you doing here?
LEON
Mrs. Ericksen, I found out some
very interesting things about you
today.
ADRIENNE
(hoarse)
Oh? Like what?

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

Leon pulls the folded production still from his pocket and
holds it up for her to see.
LEON
Your thespian background, for one
thing.
ADRIENNE
I used to act, yes.
LEON
You used to act with Paul Basque.
You remember him, don't you?
Of course.

ADRIENNE

LEON
Paul purchased the car your husband
supposedly used the night he tried
to kill you. Know what that
suggests to me, Mrs. Ericksen?
No.

ADRIENNE
What's that?

LEON
Gotcha!... There aint no Marta and
there never was.
LEON
You and Paul Basque killed your
husband for the insurance. He
bought the car as a ruse. You've
been lovers since you performed
together.
(a grin)
On the stage, I mean.
ADRIENNE
You're mistaken, Detective. Paul
Basque was a friend of my
husband's. He was the one who
introduced us.
Leon's expression reveals that his neat package may be
falling apart.
An explosion, Marta leaps from the shadows where she's been
hiding, and yelling like a madwoman, plunges a knife deep
into Leon's chest as Adrienne screams.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

Leon staggers back, already falling into the abyss of shock,
as he stares at Marta. Gurgling, Leon drops to the carpet.
Adrienne's screams continue...
INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
The place is almost deserted as the last of the day crew
wander out. Gentry enters and moves for his work area. He
corrals FELDMAN, another detective.
GENTRY
Any messages?
FELDMAN
It's all there in your basket. Leon
was trying to get in touch with you
earlier, and there've been a couple
of calls from some woman.
Gentry finds his pile of messages and shuffles through them.
One makes him stop. Adrienne Another. Two more. Four in
all. Gentry checks the times. Last half hour or so.
The phone rings.

Gentry almost leaps for it.

Homicide.

GENTRY
Sergeant Gentry.

out-of-service tone comes on.
Across the room, Feldman is just now moving for the door.

GENTRY

Feldman stops, surprised by Gentry's outburst.
FELDMAN

Gentry wrestles with it a long moment before:

No.

GENTRY
Nothing.

Gentry surges past him and out.
EXT./INT. GENTRY'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Gentry drives with passionate abandon. His steely eyes are
fixed on the road ahead and farther, the beach house and what
waits for him there.
EXT. A LONELY STRETCH OF BEACH - NIGHT
The Porsche screeches to a stop at the edge of a dune, dust
billowing behind it. Gentry leaps free of the car, pops the
front trunk, pulls out a suitcase. Removing his jacket,
Gentry pulls shirts and slacks from the case and tosses them
aside until he finds a dark turtle-neck sweater and pulls it
on.
From a crumpled sack on the passenger seat Gentry takes a can
of black shoe polish and spreads it across cheek and brow. A
moment later he's pulled a knit cap over his hair and ears.
He tapes a knife to one calf.
Looking like a commando now, Gentry moves for the beach.
EXT. BEACH SIDE OF ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Gentry pauses near the surf.
He makes for it.

The house is completely dark.

NEAR THE DECK - GENTRY
pauses and listens. The roar of the sea drowns everything.
Creeping closer, Gentry sees movement at the window, a brief,
formless shape passing in the moonlight.
Gentry flattens onto the deck and rests, cheek-to-board, for
a long moment. Then, like a snake, he crawls toward the
glass door.
Inches from the glass, Gentry looks inside.

INT. ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT
A surreal scene: Leon sits in one chair.
out of Gentry's line-of-sight.

Leon's corpse is

Adrienne sits absolutely still on the couch. She might be
dead herself... until her eyes betray a look at the glass
and the sea beyond. Can she see Gentry?
A form in near shadow.

A gun in its hand.

EXT. ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Gentry brings his weapon up and waits for the shadow to
become a target. It denies him. The shadow flits to another
darkness, this nebula behind Adrienne, whose body shields it.
Suppressing a curse, Gentry slowly returns the gun to his
belt and retreats from the glass.
At the deck's edge, Gentry rolls to the sand and makes his
way along the front of the house to the side walkway.
At the side door, Gentry drops to his knees and maneuvers
below the window-line past the entrance.
Gentry ascends the wall of the garage to the second floor,
then up to the master bedroom window. A moment later, he's
inside.
INT. ADRIENNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Gentry turns from the window and knocks a lamp from its
perch, catching it inches from the floor.
A moment later he's at the door. Like the night of Douglas
Ericksen's death, the door squeaks as it is pulled open.
From below:
MARTA'S VOICE
What was that?!
Half through the doorway, Gentry listens to:
What?

ADRIENNE'S VOICE
I didn't hear anything.

A noise.
No choice now.

MARTA'S VOICE
From the stairs.

He continues through.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

STAIRS - GENTRY
pulls his service revolver and moves with stealth to the top
of the stairs.
ADRIENNE'S VOICE
It's nothing. It's probably my
cat, Buttermilk.
MARTA
(rough)
We're going to check it out anyway!
Gentry assumes a firing position with the revolver pointed
downward into the well of darkness. He hears footsteps...
and then the meow of a cat as it prances across the threshold
of the stairs below.
Adrienne, having just moved into moonlight, picks up the cat.
ADRIENNE
See? I told you. It was just
Buttermilk.
Come on.

MARTA
Back over here.

Adrienne turns. Her eyes trail upward. She sees Gentry.
Their eyes lock. She continues to pet the cat automatically
before:
ADRIENNE
It's all right, Buttermilk.
all right.

It's

Holding the cat to her cheek, Adrienne turns and does what
Marta has told her to do.
Gentry descends the steps. One at a time. Slowly. Each
foot-fall measured to deny noise. The gun held out and
aimed, prepared to fire. Voices. Marta's. Adrienne's.
Words lost to the hiss of Gentry's breathing. Sweat cascades
from his brow, sweat and shoe polish dripping to the carpet.
Still he moves forward.
LIVING ROOM - GENTRY
reaches the base of the stairs. He sees Adrienne sitting
before the window still petting the cat. Across from her
another form, obscured by darkness.
ADRIENNE
He's not coming.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

MARTA'S VOICE
The hell he's not.
ADRIENNE
This isn't going to work.
MARTA'S VOICE
You better hope it does.
Gentry moves forward until he's mere feet from the sitting
form obscured by darkness. Then:
Freeze!

GENTRY
Don't move!

The silence is deafening.

No motion at all.

Finally:

GENTRY
Adrienne, turn on a light.
Adrienne stands, moves to the end of the couch, reaches over
and switches the lamp on.
Gentry stares down the barrel of his cocked gun at... Leon's
corpse. Stunned, he cannot move.
ADRIENNE
He's dead, Pete.
A mindless reaction, Gentry pivots to face Marta who stands
across the room, her weapon aimed at Adrienne.
Drop it!

MARTA
Or I'll kill her!

Adrienne stands between them, an easy target.

Gentry lowers

Marta moves forward, gestures Gentry to move back, takes the
weapon he dropped on the floor. The moment the gun is in
Marta's possession, Adrienne steps forward and kisses Marta
lustily.
Adrienne pulls back and grins at Gentry, who stands mute.
MARTA
So tell me, darling... what kind of
fuck is he?
ADRIENNE
Not bad, actually. Not as good as
you, but not bad at all.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

MARTA
Lots of enthusiasm, I imagine...
ADRIENNE
(appraising Gentry)
Yes, that's one way to put it.
They see Gentry's dumb-struck look and laugh.
ADRIENNE
You'd better tell him, or he's
liable to have a heart attack.
MARTA
Can't have that, can we?

Marta reaches up and pulls the wig off.

"Marta" becomes Paul

killers, Sergeant Gentry, just the

Bring me my clothes.
Adrienne ascends the stairs to the bedroom as Gentry sits
beside Leon, who topples onto him. Gentry catches the corpse
of his friend and, as if realizing that he's dead for the
first time, gently lowers Leon to the floor.
PAUL
A casualty of poor planning, your
friend.
Gentry's look of anger and hatred surprises even Paul.
PAUL
Don't get any ideas. I enjoy
killing. It's more fun than
anything except...

... stealing that extra bow.
Adrienne returns with Paul's clothes.

He gives her Gentry's

PAUL
Don't kill him unless you have to.
Paul removes the blouse and padded bra.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

PAUL
Sergeant Gentry, we're going to
make a little deal. The honest
truth is, we bungled the job. We
thought we'd planned an air-tight
murder, but as you well know, it
started to unravel almost
immediately.
The skirt drops to the floor, revealing pantihose and beneath
them, jockey shorts. He kicks off the heels, sits to remove
the pantihose.
PAUL
Now it doesn't matter if we kill
you or not; your successor will
come to the same conclusions you
would have come to, which is that
Adrienne and an accomplice killed
her husband for his money. So...
we have to get rid of Adrienne
Ericksen, too.
GENTRY
What makes you think you're getting
any better at this?
Naked but for the jockey shorts, Paul pulls on jeans and a tshirt.
PAUL
This is the "you can't get away
with it" speech. Save it. If we
get caught now, we both fry and we
know it... There are a number of
witnesses who saw a woman matching
"Marta's" description accompany
Adrienne Ericksen this afternoon as
she withdrew two million dollars in
insurance money from her account.
Tomorrow or the next day someone's
going to find Detective Kessler's
body there.
GENTRY
Or maybe they'll find mine.
Paul stops for only a moment before using a garment to wipe
make-up from his face. He grins.

PAUL
Or maybe they'll find yours, out in
the desert where you chased Marta

Dressed now, Paul gathers up his "Marta" clothes and ties
them together with a belt.
PAUL
They'll also find lots of blood in
Adrienne's car. Adrienne's blood.
She's already donated it. It's in

PAUL
Doesn't matter. They'll look for a

Dressed now, Paul returns and gestures for Adrienne to give
him her weapon. The moment she does Gentry dives for the
endtable lamp. Paul fires, hitting Gentry as he flies across
the couch and behind, the light dying behind him.
PAUL
Out of the way!
Paul pushes Adrienne toward the glass door and fires three
times, each round providing a flash of illumination.
Gentry, behind the couch, yanks the knife free from where he
taped it to his calf and crawls away from the flashes.
PAUL
Turn on the lights!

Paul almost topples over a table before he reaches the wall
where the light switch is located. The light flashes on...
to disclose Gentry standing across the room, waiting. The
moment Paul turns Gentry's knife thuds into his chest and he
drops already dead to the floor.
Gentry and Adrienne stand across the room from one another,
Gentry defenseless, Adrienne still armed with a handgun.

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

He hobbles toward her, the red stain on the left side of his
ribcage widening as he moves. Adrienne brings the pistol up.
Gentry continues. She cocks the weapon. Gentry gets closer.
Her finger tenses. Closer. Finger squeezing. Closer.
She lowers the gun.
ADRIENNE
I never wanted to hurt you, Pete. I
love you. Paul made me do it. He
was crazy. I was afraid of him.
Afraid that if I didn't -He takes the gun from her.
ADRIENNE
I have the money. We can figure
something out, can't we? Something
to explain all this? Because I
love you, Pete. We can be rich and
we can be together.
Gentry is in tremendous pain. Blood seeps out of him. He
blinks to retain consciousness. And there's more. After
everything she's done, there remains in Gentry feeling for
Adrienne.
Adrienne looks up into his eyes.

Her beauty is exquisite.

ADRIENNE
We can think of something to say...
GENTRY
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say can and
will be used against you in
court...
Gentry staggers back to the phone, gets a dial tone, taps in
three numbers. As he dials:
GENTRY
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.
(phone)
This is Sergeant Gentry, LAPD...

FADE OUT:
