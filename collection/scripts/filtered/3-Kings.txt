FADE IN:

EXT. IRAQI DESERT - WIDE ANGLE POV OF WIDE OPEN DESERT FIRST KILL
Flat grey sky.
The CAMERA is running forward, TOWARD a big sand berm in
the distance. There are O.S. sounds: soldier's EQUIPMENT
CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a man's BREATHING.
The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders
appear in the BOTTOM OF the FRAME, running. This is TROY
BARLOW, Sergeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet
is a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.
Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an Iraqi
soldier stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath,
and stares at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters
a white flag over his head, then puts it down and picks
up a gun. Troy turns around, we see his face for the
first time.
TROY
Are we shooting people, or what?
BERM SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
Are we shooting?
TORY
That's what I'm asking you.
BERM SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
What's the answer?
TROY
I don't know the answer. That's
what I'm trying to find out.
PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands
with his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into
his eyes.
BERM SOLDIER #3
It looks like a grain of sand, but
I don't know how I'm gonna get it
out -PAN TO three soldiers 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN -SOLDIER #4 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his
mouth. SOLDIERS #5 and #6, plus CONRAD VIG, 22, wiry,
intense, deep South, and WALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall,
Southern, put out their hands and get pieces of gum.

TROY (O.S.)
I think this guy has a weapon.

The Soldiers get ready with their guns, scared.
CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
If they surrender, don't shoot, if
they don't surrender, blow 'em
away.
PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then
turns back to the dune and runs a few yards. Stops and
stares, raises his rifle. He aims at the figure on the
horizon.
POV THROUGH SIGHT POST
The Iraqi soldier in Troy's sight post, holding a rifle
up. Hear Troy's BREATHING, loud, as he pulls trigger
slowly. SLOW MOTION RIFLE sound.
Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his
neck explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for
sound of Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks TOWARD the big
berm, and UP TO the crest. All we hear are his FOOTSTEPS
and BREATHING.
BERM SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)
That guy just shot an A-rab.
Bullshit.

BERM SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)

YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER
lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away.
He is rasping, a white flag is clasped in one hand; a
rifle in the other. He is looking up at Troy, who looks
down at him.
SMASH CUT TO:

FANTASY - INT. MICHIGAN HOSPITAL - DAY

A white baby girl, covered in blood and placenta, is
pulled from between the legs of Troy's wife, DEBBIE. The
nurse holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy.

VIG (V.O.)
(deep Southern accent)
Congratulations, you got yourself
a Eye-raqi, my man.

EXT. IRAQI DESERT - FIRST KILL - DAY (PRESENT)

PAN TO Conrad Vig.
Dag.

VIG
PAN FROM dead Iraqi TO Troy, upset, as he murmurs "I Get
Around" by the BEACH BOYS.
TROY
'Gettin' bugged drivin' up and
down the same old strip, gotta
find a new place where the kids
are hip, I get around -- '
BERM SOLDIER #1
I didn't think I'd see anyone get
shot over here.
BERM SOLDIER #5
Take my picture.
VIG
Do you still want to sell
pictures?
TROY
(distracted monotone)
For twenty.
BERM SOLDIER #5
Twenty dollars for a hoo-a shot,
man, what's the meaning of life?
BERM SOLDIER #1
What an asshole.
WALTER
You're lucky you got to see
anybody shot in this war.
VIG
Been over five days, Jim, ain't
gonna be much more of this.
BERM SOLDIER #5
Bobby, take my picture.

He holds the camera out.
BERM SOLDIER #3
If he shot the guy, it's up to
him.
BERM SOLDIER #5
It's not like he shot a fucking
deer. It's the enemy.
VIG
Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.
Soldiers get their cash out, Vig takes it.
BERM SOLDIER #1
Show some respect for the dead.
BERM SOLDIER #3
Yeah, leave him in peace.
SOLDIER #5 bends next to the corpse and holds his camera
out at arm's length.
VIG
No free pictures, motherfucker.
Vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they
roll down the sand berm.
"I Just Want to Celebrate" by RARE EARTH comes on
loud.
Troy walks away holding his temple in pain; Soldiers
gather to stare at the dead Iraqi, getting their cameras
out.

EXT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY - DESERT ROAD - DAY

American soldiers in combat gear dance on a road in the
desert. "I JUST WANT TO CELEBRATE" BLARES as the CAMERA
DOLLIES THROUGH the soldiers.

EXT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY CAMP - DAY
DOLLY INTO tent town, PAST bare-chested soldiers pumping
free weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big
water storage mattresses.

EXT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY - CAMP PERIMETER - DAY
DOLLY OUT of tent town, PAST a lone boom operator, PAST
three soldiers at piss tubes, as MUSIC CONTINUES.
ADRIANA CRUZ (O.S.)
Spirits are high and the music is
boisterous as these young troops
celebrate -- shit. Let me try
that again.
DOLLY AROUND the dancing soldiers to see: 36 stripped
Iraqi solders lying face down in undershorts.
ADRIANA CRUZ (O.S.)
Spirits are high and the music is
motherfucking sand in my eye -PAN TO CNN reporter ADRIANA CRUZ, 45, in white safari
jacket over Desert Storm fatigues, cleaning her eye;
nearby a cluster of rowdy soldiers who are mugging into
the camera.
ADRIANA CRUZ (O.S.)
Spirits are high and the music is
soaring as these young troops -did I just say 'soaring'?
PAN TO cameraman, PACO.
PACO
I think you said soaring.
ADRIANA CRUZ
Did I or didn't I?
DOLLY TO ARCHIE GATES, 40, Major, Special Forces, wearing
sunglasses.
ARCHIE GATES
You said 'soaring.'
ADRIANA CRUZ
How did it sound?
ARCHIE GATES
Like bullshit. But this is a
bullshit story.
ADRIANA CRUZ
The end of the war's a bullshit
story?
ARCHIE GATES
Saddam's still here.

ADRIANA CRUZ
This is a huge win.
ARCHIE GATES
How about the Shiites?
ADRIANA CRUZ
Arab versus Arab won't play for
the network right now.
ARCHIE GATES
How about the gold thing?
ADRIANA CRUZ
I don't have anything on that.
ARCHIE GATES
Okay, forget it, tape these guys
over here. Cathy, what's up?

Archie and CATHY DAITCH, 30, another reporter, walk off.
ADRIANA CRUZ
Where the hell are you going?
ARCHIE GATES
You don't need me for this.
ADRIANA CRUZ
They won't let me go anywhere
without an escort, goddamn it.
ARCHIE GATES
You're not going anywhere, you're
doing the celebration story.
SMASH CUT TO:
ROWDY SOLDIERS

Wee-ha.
You're heroes.
We're heroes.

CAMP SOLDIER #9
ADRIANA CRUZ
CAMP SOLDIER #9

CAMP SOLDIER #8
Give war a chance.
ADRIANA CRUZ
You exorcised the ghosts of
Vietnam with a clear moral
imperative -CAMP SOLDIER #10
Is that what we did?
We kicked ass.

CAMP SOLDIER #8
We're number one.

CAMP SOLDIER #11
We didn't get rid of fucking
Saddam -CAMP SOLDIER #10
Which totally sucks a big dick.
CAMP SOLDIER #12
Those people are getting reamed -CAMP SOLDIER #9
Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.
ADRIANA CRUZ
Who's getting reemed?
CAMP SOLDIER #11
I don't know who they are -CAMP SOLDIER #10
We got huge firepower and we ain't
helping -CAMP SOLDIER #11
It's fucked up.
CAMP SOLDIER #8
Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.
Weee-haaa.

Adriana watches impassively.

"Proud to Be An American," into Cruz's camera -(CONTINUED)

DISSOLVE TO:

POV FROM CHOPPER - DUSK
"PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN" BLASTS, CHOPPER PILOTS sing off
key.
CHOPPER PILOTS
' -- be livin' here today because
the flag still stands for freedom
and they can't take that
awayyyyy -- '

INT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY - LARGE TENT - NIGHT
Troy, wearing a checked Arab headdress, is paraded on
shoulders. He holds up a Coke in one hand and Pepsi can
in the other, like torches.
TROY
(screaming the song)
And I'm proud to be an American,
where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who
died, who gave that right to me.
And I'd gladly stand up; next to
you and defend her still today.
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love
this land, God bless the U.S.A. -Soldiers scream and go nuts.

Soda is sputtered and spit.

"I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by PUBLIC ENEMY BLASTS.

Walter Wogoman operates two parallel boom boxes like a DJ.
A soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top
of another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig,
wearing a bandage across his nose from the fight on the
berm, does a series of cheerleader-like karate arm
movements. Troy dances.
Soldiers whip brightly-painted toy footballs at Troy. He
whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes.
Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as
the music blasts. Two soldiers fire their fingers like
pistols at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce
animal.
TROY
Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Vig screams into Troy's face at point-blank range.
VIG
Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.
TROY
Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

INT. TV TRUCK - NIGHT

Archie madly humps Cathy, slamming into TV monitors.
CATHY DAITCH
You are a trained warrior, trained
warrior, Jesus Christ, Major
Gates!
Monitors crash to the floor as Cathy climaxes. Archie
rolls to the side and stares at TV images of celebrating
soldiers.
CATHY DAITCH
(out of breath)
What's Adriana got?
ARCHIE GATES
(out of breath)
Just the celebration.
That's it?
That's it.

CATHY DAITCH
ARCHIE GATES

CATHY DAITCH
I got something on the gold.
Like what?

ARCHIE GATES
CATHY DAITCH
They think it could be in some
bunkers.
ARCHIE GATES
That doesn't mean anything.
Why not?

CATHY DAITCH
ARCHIE GATES
There's thousands of bunkers in
Iraq.
CATHY DAITCH
Why don't you stay and help me
figure it out, I had some shrimp
flown in -ARCHIE GATES
I gotta keep an eye on Adriana -CATHY DAITCH
Boy, she really gets the full
baby-sitting service, doesn't she?
You all do.

ARCHIE GATES

EXT. TV TRUCK - NIGHT

9A

The door opens, and COLONEL HORN, 45, stands there, with
Adriana Cruz behind, pissed. Cathy grabs her clothes.
ARCHIE GATES
What's going on?
COLONEL HORN
I was about to ask you the same
question, Major.
ADRIANA CRUZ
You said he was former Delta, he'd
take great care of me, what a
bunch of bullshit -(CONTINUED)

9A

9A
COLONEL HORN
Would you please let me handle
this?
ADRIANA CRUZ
Doesn't she have her own goddamn
escort?
COLONEL HORN
Of course she does.
WHIP PAN TO:

PRIM, MOUSY WOMAN SERGEANT
Embarrassed, stands nearby.
ADRIANA CRUZ
Why don't you give her someone she
can fuck so she'll leave my escort
alone?
CATHY DAITCH
That is really unnecessary.
ADRIANA CRUZ
I don't want him walking away from
me, giving my stories away -What stories?
stories.

ARCHIE GATES
You don't have any

ADRIANA CRUZ
You don't fucking tell people
that -CATHY DAITCH
Look at yourself, my God, you're
pathetic -ADRIANA CRUZ
Look at me? Is that what you're
saying, with your panties around
your ears?
COLONEL HORN
I really don't need this shit.
Archie just looks at Horn silently.

INT. BUNK TENT - NIGHT

CHIEF ELGIN is 29, stocky, black, no nonsense, shouts.

Chief hands him papers.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Let's all try to picture the
marksmanship, the focus, the
mastery of fear, required to shoot
across 500 meters -TROY
It might've been more like 250 -No way.
Maybe 400.

Blew the guy's head three feet

CAPTAIN VAN METER
His arm gets shot

VIG
While he's still firing his gun -WALTER
And when his arm hits the
ground -WALTER AND VAN METER
His hand keeps on firing.
TROY
Did you see the guy with his ear
hanging off, sir?
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Arnold Schwarzenegger or Carl
Weathers?
TROY
No, I heard it happened here.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Whatever, we'll be going home
soon, and tomorrow we round up
more Eye-Raqis.
They all cheer.

EXT. DESERT - SURRENDER SITE - WIDE SHOT - DAY

Hundreds of Iraqis walking in the desert, hands raised
above their heads.
TRANSLATOR
(megaphone, in Arabic)
Lay down your weapons, get down on
the ground.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
We will not hurt you. Lay down
your weapons, get on the ground -Two tagged Iraqis with bad face wounds get medical help.

Five Iraqis on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as
they disrobe. They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as
he holds his M-16 on the begging Iraqis. Walter tags a
few.
TROY
It's cool, no one's gonna hurt
you -Vig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol, points it at
them.
VIG
Did you rape and torture anybody
in Kuwait, Abdul?
The Iraqis wail for mercy.
away.

Troy pushes Vig's pistol

TROY
You're making them all hysterical,
and you're gonna get busted for
having that pistol.
Vig points the big pistol at an older IRAQI OFFICER who
is the only one not taking his clothes off.
VIG
Take your fucking rags off, take
these off. No comprende English,
motherfucker?
TROY
What is your fucking problem,
Conrad? Could you act in a more
professional manner, please?
VIG
I'm sorry, I'm just tryin' git him
to obey the spirit of things. I
want to be professional about it.
TROY
(leans down)
Sir? We need you to disrobe like
all the other A-rabs, okay?
The Officer does not move.
TROY
I hate to see it come to this.
Vig and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants
off. Troy turns to the other prisoners.

TROY
Stay down, it's gonna be all
right.
VIG
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
Troy looks at the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled
up piece of paper is sticking out -TROY
There's a document in that guy's
ass.
VIG
We got a classified situation.
WALTER
Do you think he ate it?
TROY
It wouldn't come out perfect like
that if he ate it.
Troy pulls a latex glove out of his pocket.
TROY
Pull it out, private.

No!

IRAQI OFFICER
(in Arabic)
Stop! Get the fuck off me.

The Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by
Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the
rolled-up, greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy
looks disgusted.
Open it up.

TROY
VIG
You only gave me one glove.
TROY
I'm sorry I don't have another
glove, but you gotta open it up.
That's how the chain of command
works.
Vig takes out a U.S. Army pen and uses it to unroll the
greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand.

CLOSEUP - RUMPLED PAPER
It is a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few
spare roads, numbers, and three small boxes.
VIG
What the hell is that?
TROY
Important enough to squeeze your
cheeks for.
BERM SOLDIER #1
Hey, look at this -TROY
Back up, motherfuckers -Vig pushes Berm Solider #1 and another soldier as they
rubberneck.

EXT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY - DAY

Archie sits on a folding chair facing COLONEL HORN, 45,
who is furious. Soldiers and vehicles pass.
COLONEL HORN
You're supposed to make her feel
good about the stories we want,
not push stories we don't want,
and you don't walk away from her
to fuck another journalist.
ARCHIE GATES
I never wanted this job, Ron.
COLONEL HORN
It's a great job, Arch, your work
in Iraq was over, I'm trying to
help you out.
ARCHIE GATES
I don't even know what we did over
here.
COLONEL HORN
Don't even start that with me,
because this has been a huge
success.
ARCHIE GATES
You got your star clinched.

COLONEL HORN
(touches his collar)
It's not my fault you plateaued a
long time ago, big-mouthed N.C.O.
at heart.
ARCHIE GATES
Just tell me what we did here,
Ron.
COLONEL HORN
You want to occupy Iraq and do
Vietnam again, is that what you
want?
ARCHIE GATES
Fuck it, I'm retiring, anyway.
don't care.

COLONEL HORN
Until you do, you're an Army
officer, and you're still taking
care of that reporter, so do it
right. Maybe she'll hook you up
to consult with the media at home.
Fuck that.

ARCHIE GATES

INT. CAPTAIN'S TENT - DAY

SPLASH -- rubbing alcohol is poured over Vig's extended
hand by Chief.
TROY
You've washed your hands like a
thousand times, Conrad.
VIG
Lord knows what vermin live in the
butt of a dune koon.
CHIEF
Don't say that around me.
VIG
Captain uses them terms.
CHIEF
Why do you let this cracker follow
you around?

TROY
He's all right, man, he's got no
high school, he's from a group
home in Jackson -VIG
Don't tell people that.
CHIEF
I don't give a shit if he's from
Johannesburg. I don't want to
hear dune koon or sand nigger from
him or anybody.
VIG
Okay, how about camel jockey and
towel head, hoo-wa?
No.
No.

CHIEF
TROY
VIG
I apologize but it's a little
confusing with all that antiIraqi, pro-Saudi, and all that
language.
TROY
Did you get those aerial photos?
CHIEF
Yeah, I got 'em.
VIG
How did you do that?
CHIEF
I have my ways.
TROY
Chief is hooked up.
CHIEF
Keep Walter on the door.
TROY
Would you take those fucking
things off?
Walter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles.

WALTER
I never got to use night vision.
TROY
They don't work during the day -WALTER
Yeah, they kind of work.
TROY
Just stand outside the tent so
Chief can translate my Iraqi ass
map, okay?
Chief unfolds a big aerial-photo map of the Iraqi desert,
next to the rumpled ass map.

EXT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY - PERIMETER - DAY

ADRIANA CRUZ
You ready to work with me now?

ARCHIE GATES
It was in the guy's ass.
CAMP SOLDIER #13
That's not the real story.
Archie and Adriana follow soldiers picking up mines and
placing them in a box; a TRUCK GRINDS by; they have to
shout.
ADRIANA CRUZ
What's the real story?
CAMP SOLDIER #13
It was in the guy's dick. They
pulled it out with tweezers.

ADRIANA CRUZ
A ten-page atlas of Saddam's

CAMP SOLDIER #13
But real small like those little
books you get in Cracker Jacks.

EXT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY - DAY

They talk with TEEBAUX, a French soldier taking a bath.
TEEBAUX
They pull eet out the guy's ear.
What guy?

ADRIANA CRUZ
TEEBAUX
I cannot tell you.
ADRIANA CRUZ
You said you could tell us.
I'm sorry.

TEEBAUX
Not now.

Archie pulls her off to the side.
ARCHIE GATES
He's French Special Forces, he can
help us but he's not gonna talk to
me if you're around.
ADRIANA CRUZ
You better not be fucking with me.
ARCHIE GATES
I'm not, I'll bring it to you.
ADRIANA CRUZ
I want the story this time,
Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
I said you'll get it, okay?

CLOSEUP:

CHIEF (O.S.)
These are definitely Saddam's

What's inside?

TROY
CHIEF
According to Intel, Picasso, Sony,
Rolex, Armani. Kuwait was Arab
Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked
it.
TROY
It would be nice to bring
something home besides sand
fleas -CHIEF
Whatever, the good Lord put this
map in our path and we're gonna
find something -TROY
He could also put a land mine in
our path if we go out there -CHIEF
Don't worry, you're safe with me,
I was fire baptized.
TROY
What the hell are you talking
about?
CHIEF
I have a ring of Jesus fire to

Get the fuck out of my way.
WALTER
Mayday, Mayday -22

INT. CAPTAIN'S TENT - DAY
Troy and Chief scramble to put the maps under the table
as they stand to attention.
ARCHIE GATES
Good afternoon.
He looks them over.
ARCHIE GATES
Would this be the proctology tent?
CHIEF
Yes, sir, I mean, no, sir.
ARCHIE GATES
Then maybe it's the urology tent,
or the neurology tent, or the ear,
nose and throat tent.
TROY
Captain's at a staff meeting, sir.
ARCHIE GATES
Is the captain a urologist or a
proctologist?
They look puzzled.
ARCHIE GATES
It doesn't matter. I'm not
looking for the Captain, I'm
looking for Sergeant Barlow.
Archie pushes his finger into Troy's name tape, reaches
under the table, and takes the map, smells his fingers.
ARCHIE GATES
You're on the path to truth when
you smell shit, isn't that what
they say?

EXT. CAPTAIN'S TENT - DAY

Walter, outside the tent, practices blocking positions,
and his eyes are messed up from too much brightness.

Crossed Arrows and Special Forces patch.
They look at Archie, intimidated.
ARCHIE GATES
Did you good soldiers present this
map to your Captain?
Not yet, sir.

TROY
ARCHIE GATES
I'll take it to him.
TROY
That's not necessary, sir. We'll
take it to him. He's our C.O.
He tries to pull the map, Archie puts him in a wrist
lock.
ARCHIE GATES
Don't get grabby, Sergeant.
He stares at Troy, who's in pain.
TROY
He's our C.O., sir, we'll have to
tell him you took it.
ARCHIE GATES
It won't do either of us any good
then, will it?

They all look at him.

Archie lets go, looks at the map.

ARCHIE GATES
What do you see here?
Bunkers, sir.

CHIEF
ARCHIE GATES
What do you think is inside the
bunkers?
TROY
Stuff they stole from Kuwait.
ARCHIE GATES
Bullshit. I'm talking about 700
million in Kuwaiti bullion.
They all look at him for a moment while it sinks in.
VIG
You mean those little bullion cubes
you put in hot water for soup?
ARCHIE GATES
No, not the little bullion cubes
you put in hot water for soup.
Gold bricks.

TROY
Archie stares at each of them.
ARCHIE GATES,
Saddam stole it from the sheiks, I
have no problem stealing it from
Saddam. My guess is that he
divided his bricks into many
different stashes. Just one stash
should be easy to take from his
surrendering army, and that would
be enough to get us out of our day
jobs, unless you reservists are in
love with your day job.

Troy, Chief, Vig stare at Archie.

FANTASY - INT. OFFICE

Silent -- Troy kneels at a disassembled photocopier,
tools and parts all around him, opens a bag of toner,
which spills black dust all over his white shirt.

EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT

he drives along the tarmac in baggage carrier.

EXT. MISSISSIPPI WOODS

Vig FIRES his PISTOLS with fury at a series of stuffed

smithereens.
END OF FANTASY.

BACK TO SCENE

VIG
I don't really have a day job.
ARCHIE GATES
First we have to be sure the map
is more than a love letter from
one Iraqi to another.
TROY
It's a series of bunkers near
Karbala, sir.
Maybe.

ARCHIE GATES
CHIEF
Definitely, sir. Recon photos
match.
Archie holds the map up to the light. He puts the map on

map appears in green markings.

EXT. 437TH CIVIL AFFAIRS COMPANY - WIDE SHOT - DAWN

Three figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as

with a video camera. Adriana Cruz crouches in with
a satellite phone and dramatically gives Walter the

FIRES his M-16 and blows the ball to pieces. Archie
drives, playing BACH on the CD PLAYER.

THREE KINGS - Rev. 11/28/98

27A.

(A1)

This humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a mounted
60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill. A
second humvee leads the way, driven by Archie, PLAYING
the BACH.
Two humvees roll into the vast desert, littered with
burned-out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no
people.
Pull.

CHIEF

Troy throws another ball, Chief BLOWS it away.
Pull.

TROY
Chief throws a football from the moving humvee, Troy
FIRES an M-16 and misses the ball as it bounces to the
desert.
TROY
I gave you a better arc, Chief.
CHIEF
What are you talking about?

I threw the ball in a higher arc
that was easier for you to hit.

The humvee ahead stops abruptly; Vig JAMS on the BRAKES;
Troy and Chief fall down. Archie sits, pissed.
TROY
You said we could fire some rounds
when we were far away from camp,

Archie gets out and starts walking.
Come here.

ARCHIE GATES
They follow him to the side of the road, where a dead
body lies next to a bomb crater while a skinny cow
loiters nearby.
ARCHIE GATES
Is this what you're after?
Archie picks up a rusted metal rod and pushes it into the
bloated corpse with a HISS of GAS escaping. They pull
back and cover their mouths and noses. Chief wretches,
Troy backs up and trips over an arm sticking out of the
sand.
ARCHIE GATES
We dropped a lot of bombs out
here. We also buried guys alive.

Bradleys with big plows broke

Damn, we missed that, only action

Archie takes Vig's giant revolver, empties the chambers.
ARCHIE GATES
Shot him in the neck, didn't you?
TROY
That's right, sir.
VIG
I was there and it was amazing.
Vig swings his arms in his pseudo-karate routine.
ARCHIE GATES
Do you know anything about gunshot
wounds?
They look at him.
ARCHIE GATES
What makes any gunshot wound bad,
provided you survive the bullet,
is something called sepsis.

CHIEF
Infection of the blood.
ARCHIE GATES
Say a bullet tears into you right
now --

FANTASY - EXT. DESERT OPEN AREA - DAY

A soldier in a T-shirt stands in an open area, a bullet
hits him in the side.

handkerchiefs, REVEALING his insides pierced by a bullet
in SLOW MOTION -ARCHIE GATES (V.O.)
It creates a cavity of dead
tissue, the cavity fills up with
bile and bacteria and you're
fucked.
END OF FANTASY.

EXT. DESERT - ROAD AT CRATER - DAY
They look at him uncomfortably.
ARCHIE GATES
Then you got the kind of wound
that paralyzes or castrates or has
a scary name like tension pneumo
thorax. That's when a bullet
pierces your lung, so every time
you breathe, air leaks into your
chest cavity, and it fills up like
a balloon, crushing your heart,
your liver, your lung. Your own
breathing kills you, one breath at
a time.
They look at the corpse.
ARCHIE GATES
But we're going to do this without
firing any bullets. And just to
be sure, we're gonna do a dry run,
so put your suits on.

EXT. DESERT - ROAD AT CRATER - DAY (LATER)

Troy and Chief sit in the parked first humvee, Vig behind
the wheel. Archie sits behind the wheel of the second
humvee. They all wear anti-gas suits.
ARCHIE GATES
Violence of action means your
movement is so decisive and
powerful, the enemy is frozen and
you haven't fired a single shot.
We'll say the cow is the primary
guard outside the bunker. We pull
up fast, stop short, move very
aggressively. At last cover, I'm
the base of fire.
Got it.
And -- Go.

TROY
ARCHIE GATES
The two HUMVEES ROAR down the road; Archie stops the rear
humvee, drops down, aims his rifle. The cow stares as
the first humvee pulls up fast and stops. Troy and Chief
jump out, weapons drawn, flank the cow -The COW steps back, and EXPLODES.
Troy and Chief stand splattered with cow entrails. The
COW'S HEAD LANDS with a THUD on the hood of the humvee.
Who's hurt?

ARCHIE GATES
CHIEF
It's all cow, I think.
TROY
Yeah, it's all cow.
He picks cow entrails off himself.
VIG
Ka-boom, ya'll see that cow's head
shoot up, just like Wile E. Coyote

You said this was swept for mines.
ARCHIE GATES
That wasn't a mine, it was a
cluster bomb, very hard to see.

He inspects a gaping hole in the front grill of the lead
humvee, the radiator is shot, a hoof imbedded in it.
ARCHIE GATES
Son of a bitch.
A piece of cow flesh lands on his shoulder, he looks up.
He hears Troy singing quietly.
TROY
'My buddies and me are gettin'
real well known, the bad guys know
us and they leave us alone -- '

He just had a baby daughter and
it's like he wants a envelope a
safety inna world -Archie looks at them as Vig talks and Troy sings.
ARCHIE GATES

base of fire, no shooting, we hit
them with the blinding power of
American sunshine. Help me,

EXT. DESERT - ROAD TO VILLAGE - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY

"I Get Around" by the BEACH BOYS BLASTS as the humvee
speeds along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze
from a pole at the back of the Hummer.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - BUNKER #1 - DAY

The humvee drives fast into a village piazza with an old
fortress at one end. Vig drives as the humvee speeds
around the town square, zooming past scared Shiites in
black robes, a few skinny dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi
soldiers.
VIG
Where's the bunker?
ARCHIE GATES
It should be right -He studies the map and points to the gas station with
soldiers.

ARCHIE GATES
There.

Vig jerks the wheel right.
No -- there.

They drive fast.

ARCHIE GATES
Archie points left. Vig jerks the wheel left, past the
village well and two calm peasants, and drives straight
toward the fortress with two Iraqi soldiers in front.
Troy drops out of the moving humvee, to his belly, aims
his rifle.
Iraqi soldiers look scared as the humvee drives up, like
it's going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the
breeze.
Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone as he mans the
60mm.
VIG
We are the Army of the United
States of America. We are here to
protect you. Remain calm.
Archie and Chief leap from the humvee with weapons drawn
and their free hands held up in a "halt" sign. The two
Iraqi guards look stunned as Archie and Chief take their
machine guns and put the Iraqis face down on the ground.
They pull out plastic twist-handcuffs, as used in urban
riots.
Archie holds up a thick white document.
ARCHIE GATES
(hands up)
Orders from President Bush, step
aside.
Troy runs forward when a gaunt MOTHER, with a baby in her
arms, opens her blouse, revealing her small breasts.
Other peasants gather.
No milk.

IRAQI MOTHER WITH BABY
Baby milk.

Troy looks shocked until Archie suddenly pushes him past
the Iraqi Mother and to the door of the bunker, which
Chief holds.

INT. BUNKER #1 - DAY

Five Iraqi soldiers look disoriented and scared as they
hold their hands up in the air, stare at the cow blood on
Troy and Chief's uniforms.
Do not panic.

Step outside --

Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet.
The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands
raised, and the starved civilians spit and throw stones
at them while "I GET AROUND" KEEPS PLAYING. A CIVILIAN
man shouts from a megaphone on the roof. Vig looks up.

Chief lashes the Stern Iraqi soldier's hands behind his
back and cuffs him.
Troy SHOOTS the door lock with his PISTOL. Then backs up

He holds his shoulder in pain. Archie kicks the door
repeatedly. Troy joins him, it finally flies open.

Troy is embraced by a FRIENDLY IRAQI soldier, about 25.

The Iraqi throws his hands in the air.

INT. BUNKER #1 - CRATE ROOM - DAY`

Archie shoves the Stern Iraqi into the room and goes to a
series of wooden crates the size of file cabinets, where
Chief helps Archie take off his backpack. Archie pulls
out a bolt cutter and opens the crate, which is filled
with hundreds of Kuwaiti passports.

Chief. They freeze as -The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet

An Iraqi soldier FIRES a GRENADE-LAUNCHER off his
shoulder, which EXPLODES the container on the back of the
truck.
Milk explodes everywhere, cascading in a small wave over
Archie and the others who have dived for cover.
Civilian women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs
rush out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. A
skinny dog laps it up. Other Shiites crowd the humvee
and climb in.
Iraqi soldiers drag the two bodies from the cab of the

He grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle.
Vig STARTS the ENGINE.
ARCHIE GATES
Give them M.R.E.s.
Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army
meal rations and bottled water to the crowd. Iraqi
soldiers rip the MREs from the civilians and step on them.
Vig leans on the HORN. The Friendly Iraqi jumps into the
rear of the Hummer as it starts to pull away. Archie
shoves the Friendly Iraqi out, and he lands on his ass in
the swarm of chasing civilians. Archie and Troy look back at
the debacle as they pull away.

Archie pauses, then gives the Sergeant a backhand that
sends him flying to the corner. Archie steps on the
man's wrist, takes a pistol out of his hand. Troy
watches.
Archie turns and sees nine civilians across the room: A
pair of twin brothers in Western clothing, a woman in
Western clothing, two women in traditional robes, and
four children. The men and women are bound and gagged.
Archie steps toward the civilians, but the interrogator,
SA'ID, 35, also a captain, steps in his way.
SA'ID
These rebel Iraq problem.
States is out now.

United

Archie stares at Sa'id with contempt.
SA'ID
We take them outside, so it don't
bother you, okay, sir?
(in Arabic)
Take them out.
The disarmed Iraqi Sergeant nods and opens a small rear
door and pushes the rebel civilians out. Archie walks
back to the main room and points his pistol in Sa'id's
face.
ARCHIE GATES
Take us to the basement.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - BUNKER #2 - DAY

Vig keeps the five cuffed Iraqi guards on the ground at
gunpoint as 15 Shiites with crude clubs and slingshots
encircle.
America!

BUNKER #2 REBEL
We beat Saddam now!

One of the civilians shoots a rock from the slingshot and
nails a handcuffed Iraqi in the back of the head.

VIG
Don't start this shit again.

The civilians and Iraqi soldiers back away as Vig mans the
mounted humvee machine gun.
VIG
I know y'all Shiite gettin' yer
ass whipped -- hey, what the hell
is going on here?
PAN TO the nine civilians, and the naked Man with Glasses,
who is getting dressed, exiting the bunker, ushered by
the unarmed Iraqi Sergeant.
VIG
Git on the fucking ground, Arab.
BUNKER #2 INTERROGATION SERGEANT
Prisoner stay.
(in Arabic)
Don't you move.
VIG
What the fuck are you talking
about?
Suddenly, an Iraqi woman runs up to the tortured Man
with Glasses and embraces him, sobbing. A little girl
with dirty casts on both broken arms runs up and hugs his
legs.
The bound civilians prisoners start to walk away from the
bunker as someone cuts their ropes, and the unarmed
Sergeant has a fit.
BUNKER #2 INTERROGATION SERGEANT
(in Arabic)
Prisoners stay, don't move!
He and two other unarmed Iraqi soldiers chase the
prisoners, push them back. The free civilians shoot rocks
and club them. A cuffed guard tries to fight back. Vig
swings toward him.
VIG
Goddamn it, everybody, calm down.

INT. BUNKER #2 - STAIRWAY - DAY

Archie runs down several narrow sets of cement stairs,
followed by Sa'id, the other Iraqi Captain, Troy, and
Chief.

BUNKER #2 STOREROOM CAPTAIN

It's my ass, donkey dick, Saddam

SA'ID
(subtitled; Arabic)
Saddam worries more about the
rebels than the gold.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - BUNKER #2 - DAY

The civilian crowd is beating on the unarmed Iraqi
soldiers who try to defend themselves; the Iraqi Sergeant
is holding on to the Man in Glasses while the woman beats
on him; the little girl is shouting. Suddenly an Iraqi
armored truck with a mounted machine gun races up and
seven Republican guards pour out swinging clubs, followed
by an Iraqi major, about 45.
The Iraqi soldiers savagely
beat the civilians.
Vig looks horrified as he watches.
Two soldiers grab the woman from the Sergeant holding the
Man in Glasses, the little girl chases her.
VIG
This is the United States
Military.
The Iraqi major looks Vig over, then looks back to his
soldiers as they round up eight civilians and make them
lay face down.

INT. BUNKER #2 - BASEMENT - DAY

Troy and Chief disarm two guards outside a door in the
basement.
Archie goes through the door, followed by Sa'id and the
other Captain.

INT. BUNKER #2 - BASEMENT LUGGAGE ROOM - DAY

Bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high
ceiling. Empty but for 15 brand new, jumbo-sized Louis
Vuitton suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center
of the room.
Archie stands looking at the suitcases with Troy and
Chief.

Several of the big Vuitton suitcases are laid on their
sides by Archie, Troy and Chief.
The Iraqi Captain paces frantically, punching and kicking
the walls and talking.
BUNKER #2 STOREROOM CAPTAIN
(subtitled; Arabic)
It's Saddam's gold.
SA'ID
(subtitled; Arabic)
Shut up, he signed the treaty.
The suitcases are quickly unzipped.
One suitcase is full of gleaming antique silverware. One
suitcase is full of jewelry. Archie opens one full of
hundreds of gold Cartier watches.
Troy and Chief slip a handful of jewelry into their
pockets.
The Iraqi Captain goes nuts, throwing himself on Chief's
back, choking Chief, who flails about. Troy punches the
Iraqi in the head and rips him off Chief.
Archie puts his pistol in the man's face.
ARCHIE GATES
Listen to me: we leave you alone
to beat up your people, but
everything you took from Kuwait
belongs to us now, understand?
He turns to Chief.
Put it back.
Why?

ARCHIE GATES
CHIEF
ARCHIE GATES
Stick to the plan. The plan is
for gold and we're not thieves,
we're recovering Kuwait's gold,
correct?
Chief and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of
jewelry.
Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside
-- it's full of Kuwaiti passports.

THREE KINGS - Rev. 1/8/99

When Chief opens the next suitcase, he freezes. Archie
looks over and freezes. Troy closes cuffs behind the
captain's back and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed.
The very large Vuitton suitcase is filled with ten-kilo
bricks of gold. They all stare. Troy picks one up.
TROY
Is this five kilos?
Archie holds another brick.
ARCHIE GATES
That's ten kilos.
TROY
Five, six, seven, eight, there's
thirty bricks in this suitcase.
CHIEF

Three million dollars.
Archie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is
also filled with thirty bars. Troy opens another
suitcase, there's another thirty bars. Chief opens
another, another thirty bars. They frantically check all
of the suitcases. The handcuffed captain is crying.
ARCHIE GATES
Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each.
That's thirty million dollars.
Archie, Chief, and Troy look at each other in shock.
TROY
How do we get it out of here?
ARCHIE GATES
Let's see what we're dealing with.
SMASH CUT TO:
CHIEF AND TROY
struggle with Archie to pick up the heavy, jumbo-sized
suitcases sideways, like a table top.
TROY
I'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus
convertibles in different colors.

CHIEF
I told you Lexus doesn't make a
convertible.
TROY
I'll bet you a Lexus they do.
CHIEF
You're on for a Lexus, but it
won't be a convertible.
Suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to
the floor; one lands on Troy's foot. He jumps in pain.
Shit.

TROY
Archie, Troy and Chief hoist another suitcase sideways
and the bricks rip through and fall to the floor.
CHIEF
They didn't get it here in these
bags. The tensilary strength goes
only to 200 pounds.
The what?

ARCHIE GATES
CHIEF
Tensilary strength, it's what the
suitcase can hold.
ARCHIE GATES
Why would you know a word like
that?
TROY
He works at an airport.
CHIEF
30 bars, 27 pounds each is like
900 pounds. The smaller Vuittons
handle 65, maybe more.
ARCHIE GATES
You got any more luggage here?
Sa'id looks at him.

Chief prays next to some praying civilians; he has white
ointment on his face.

Chief and Vig look at Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
We can't do that.

ARCHIE GATES
We're not supposed to be involved

We gotta get to a refugee camp or
we're dead. The nearest camps are

ARCHIE GATES
You don't need us. You can buy

No. Saddam's soldiers will never
take his gold. The only chance
we have is if we are with
Americans.

We can't go to the Iranian border.
AMIR

go to jail if you help us escape
